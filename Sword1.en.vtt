=Sword Rose=

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.580
=Episode 1=

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.980
(April 25, 2009.
Night Market District, Linshan City.)

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.310
Ma'am.

00:02:27.088 --> 00:02:28.360
- What is it?
- Ma'am.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.310
I was walking home by myself,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.030
but...

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.080
the road to my house is really dark.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.150
I'm scared to go alone.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.680
Could you walk me there?

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:45.630
Sweetie,

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.240
it's already so dark out.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.150
Where are your parents?

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.710
They're at home.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.310
My house is just over there.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.800
Alright, I'll walk you.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.590
Here, hold my hand.

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:15.680
Your grilled skewers are ready.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.590
See you.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.190
It's a little kitty.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.750
Look how cute it is.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.750
Don't be scared.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.360
Let's go.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.750
We're almost there.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.630
Just up ahead.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.430
That's the building.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.400
Go ahead.

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:16.360
Thank you, ma'am.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:17.470
Bye!

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.150
Get in the van.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.840
Hurry!

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.360
(Since the Linshan City Police Bureau)

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.600
(launched the special operation)

00:05:01.622 --> 00:05:03.600
(against the abduction
of women and children,)

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.190
(the police have intensified)

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.600
(Radio)
(their crackdown)

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.133
(on trafficking crimes.)

00:05:08.155 --> 00:05:09.630
(Several cases have been solved,)

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.600
(suspects arrested.)
Aren't you worried?

00:05:11.622 --> 00:05:12.800
(Fourteen people in total.)

00:05:12.888 --> 00:05:14.222
(Multiple victims rescued...)

00:05:38.355 --> 00:05:40.000
(Communication Starts from the Heart)

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.444
Come here.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.470
Fafa.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.177
Stay in the car.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.270
Don't get out.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.620
(Number 2)
Move.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.520
Come on!

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:43.590
Hurry, hurry!

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.080
Come on!

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:51.760
Get over here!

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.910
Well?

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.030
Looks good.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.950
Top-quality stuff, for sure.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.711
So, what do you think?

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:12.270
Quit struggling.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.800
Feisty one, huh?

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.570
Struggle again and I'll cut
your tongue out.

00:07:15.577 --> 00:07:16.180
You hear me?

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.150
Did you hear me?

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.470
What's the problem?

00:07:19.533 --> 00:07:21.688
Don't damage her, or she
won't be worth anything.

00:07:23.511 --> 00:07:24.600
There's nowhere to run.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.830
Listen, just do as you're told.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.510
Cooperate a little,

00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:32.088
and it won't be so hard on you.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.310
We're not hurting you.

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:35.750
We're helping you.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:36.480
Think about it.

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.760
We're setting you up
with a rich and powerful man.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.950
If you play your cards right,

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.360
you could live the high life.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.390
You'll never have to worry
about money again.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.310
You'll have it all.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:47.800
Am I right?

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.630
Don't be ungrateful.

00:08:04.822 --> 00:08:06.177
What are you doing? Get over here.

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:10.790
Come here.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.160
You got a death wish?

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.800
I already told you!

00:08:16.466 --> 00:08:18.377
Just cooperate and you won't suffer.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.680
Since you won't listen,

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:21.240
you leave me no choice.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.630
Fan, the buyer's almost here.

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:42.510
Maybe forget it?

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.510
She's too wild.

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:48.266
If she causes trouble,
it won't be worth it.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.390
It's hard enough finding fresh ones.

00:08:51.822 --> 00:08:53.177
Come on, keep watch.

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:05.390
Don't be scared.

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.822
I'll treat you well.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:10.840
It's all the same
no matter who you're with, right?

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.333
Don't move!

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.840
I'll treat you right.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.000
What are you so afraid of?

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:20.590
Come on.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.600
I said! Come with me!

00:10:23.133 --> 00:10:24.090
Let's go!

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.270
Stupid girl.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.910
Still acting tough?

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.390
Come here!

00:10:35.688 --> 00:10:36.977
You got a death wish?

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.320
Still acting tough?

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:42.680
Still acting tough?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.266
You think you're tough?

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.440
Do you?

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:47.630
Do you?

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.777
Come on, talk. Say something...

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.110
It's okay. You're safe now.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.280
Look at me.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.200
Look at me.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.680
You're safe now. It's over.

00:11:10.688 --> 00:11:11.790
Come on, don't be scared.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:12.900
I'll take this off for you.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.200
Don't be afraid.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.270
When we go out, hold my hand.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.630
When you see a chance, run.

00:11:21.733 --> 00:11:23.755
As soon as you're out,
call the police, got it?

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.244
Don't be afraid.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.577
Where's Bai?

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:42.844
Mind your own business.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:07.750
Fan, that girl escaped!

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:08.590
Go!

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.360
Hide under the table.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.230
Quick!

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.440
Fan!

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.160
Fan!

00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:26.110
Run!

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.520
Hit her! Now!

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:10.630
Let go of me!

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:11.590
Let me go!

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.480
Let go!

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.360
Who told you to run?

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:14.977
I'll beat you to death!

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.670
Who are you, really?

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:27.980
(One Hour Earlier)

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.320
Jiajia, what's the situation?

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.510
Captain Han, all units are in position.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.533
Everything looks normal.

00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:43.688
What about Chang Rui's side?

00:13:43.711 --> 00:13:45.555
(Linshan PGIS Application Platform)
Nothing suspicious on his side either.

00:13:45.622 --> 00:13:46.777
Did you bring it?

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.560
Just in case.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.770
Let's move.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:09.840
Is your boss here yet?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.480
On the way.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:11.320
Xiangzi.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:12.510
You stay here.

00:14:23.577 --> 00:14:24.590
She's wearing a hood.

00:14:24.866 --> 00:14:26.244
Can't tell if it's Zhou Min.

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:28.533
Looks like the big fish
is about to bite.

00:14:28.750 --> 00:14:29.720
Should we move in closer?

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:31.440
No, wait.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:32.630
Stay calm.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.177
Wait until they start the deal.

00:14:39.688 --> 00:14:41.288
A girl just ran out.

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:51.960
Yan Lei.

00:14:52.177 --> 00:14:53.688
Take a team and intercept.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.266
Make sure the victim is safe.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.110
Yes, Sir.

00:14:57.088 --> 00:14:58.110
Scream, will you?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.400
Who are you, really?

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:06.650
Tell Mr. Yin,

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.822
we've got a new situation.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.960
A girl escaped!

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.150
There's another girl inside.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.960
Please, save her.

00:15:13.244 --> 00:15:14.911
She says there's another girl inside.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:18.440
Everyone, move in.

00:15:18.466 --> 00:15:19.720
There's another victim inside.

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.422
(SWAT)
Ensure the victim's safety.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.230
Where's the girl?

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.360
Where's my merchandise?

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.480
Get her back, now!

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.550
That's my money!

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:48.910
- Cops!
- It's the cops!

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:00.910
Freeze!

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:01.750
Don't move!

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:02.870
Stop!

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:04.120
- Stop!
- Stop!

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:19.390
Back off!

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:20.350
Everyone, step back!

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:21.550
Put your guns down!

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.440
Or I'll kill her!

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:27.240
Who's in charge?

00:16:27.311 --> 00:16:28.222
Ask him to come here.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.080
Now!

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.510
Vice Director Yin.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:31.600
The suspect is inside.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.440
He's taken a hostage.

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:39.880
You!

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.870
Get me a car!

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.870
Full tank!

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:42.920
Right now!

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.040
Move!

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:45.888
Go. Execute Plan B.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:46.920
Yes, Sir.

00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:54.240
Rui!

00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.200
Are you okay?

00:16:55.711 --> 00:16:56.288
Don't move.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.160
Take him away.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:01.510
Go.

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:02.470
What just happened?

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.240
How should I know?

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:07.200
The car's ready for you.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:08.280
Come out.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.240
I'm warning you!

00:17:09.422 --> 00:17:10.866
Don't play games with me!

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.270
Or I'll kill her.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.360
All units,

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.330
put down your weapons.

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:15.040
Fall back.

00:17:25.666 --> 00:17:26.688
Move.

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:29.390
Back up!

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.350
Back up more!

00:18:01.222 --> 00:18:02.160
- Let go!
- Don't move!

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.000
Let me go!

00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:04.110
Let go...

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.720
The hostage...

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.000
Are you alright?

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:08.110
I'm fine.

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:09.110
I'm a police officer too.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.555
Deng Yan, from the Provincial Bureau.

00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:22.550
What are you doing here?

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.480
What's your name?

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:31.870
Where do you live?

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.520
Not talking?

00:18:36.022 --> 00:18:37.000
I'm a police officer.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.266
Let me take you home, okay?

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.320
Stop her!

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:43.830
Let go of me!

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:44.600
Sweetie.

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.440
Let go of me!

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.070
Sweetie.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.000
Let me go now!

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.840
Listen to me.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:48.830
We're the police.

00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.030
We won't hurt you, okay?

00:18:50.222 --> 00:18:51.533
Go with the officer first.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.480
Take her away.

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.000
Let me go!

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:00.430
Be quiet!

00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:01.733
Head down, move!

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.430
Move it!

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.390
Get them in the van!

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.800
Move.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.800
Get in.

00:19:11.288 --> 00:19:12.577
Did we catch the handler?

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.110
No.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.590
What on earth happened?

00:19:18.288 --> 00:19:19.329
I'm not sure either.

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.109
But it seems one of the victims

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:24.422
is from the Secretariat Division
of the Provincial Bureau.

00:19:25.377 --> 00:19:27.555
Why would someone from
the Provincial Bureau be here?

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.320
No idea.

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.230
Where is she now?

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.444
Gone to give a statement.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:07.180
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:12.244
(People's Republic of China - Police)

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.480
Chief Xiao.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.200
I know I disrupted
the Anti-abduction Office's operation,

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:36.240
but the girl was in danger.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.960
As a police officer, I had to act.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:39.590
Deng,

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:42.440
the safety of the people
always comes first.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.155
I trust your judgment.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.866
Come on. Let's go
to the Anti-abduction Office.

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:54.110
Captain Han.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.550
What?

00:20:55.577 --> 00:20:56.933
Deng Yan from the Provincial Bureau

00:20:56.933 --> 00:20:58.822
is getting parachuted in
as our new director.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.977
Keep your voice down.

00:21:00.977 --> 00:21:01.777
Close the door.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.400
I have an announcement.

00:21:06.644 --> 00:21:08.240
This is a decision from the committee.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.350
Deng Yan

00:21:09.444 --> 00:21:11.920
will be appointed Director
of the Anti-abduction Office.

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.790
She previously served as a section chief
in the Provincial Bureau Secretariat.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.310
I hope everyone will cooperate with her.

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:19.680
She worked in an admin role,

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.920
but we're on the front lines here.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.720
We investigate every case in person,

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.200
bit by bit, on the ground.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.240
She's got no experience.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.000
Working under her? That's a joke.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.950
Deng Yan,

00:21:36.955 --> 00:21:38.600
the Anti-abduction Office is yours now.

00:21:39.777 --> 00:21:40.569
Then tell me,

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.200
who do you think should lead the office?

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.510
Definitely Vice Director Yin.

00:21:43.577 --> 00:21:45.733
He has the experience,
the skill, and the seniority.

00:21:45.777 --> 00:21:47.066
He's the most qualified.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:48.960
I just don't understand

00:21:49.155 --> 00:21:50.640
what the higher-ups were thinking.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.950
Welcome, welcome!

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.430
Welcome aboard!

00:21:53.550 --> 00:21:54.030
Thank you.

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:54.600
Well...

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.022
Let's all introduce ourselves.

00:21:56.111 --> 00:21:57.222
No need for introductions.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.120
I've already

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.550
gotten to know all of you.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:00.670
Yan Lei.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.720
Ai Xin.

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.760
Chang Rui.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.520
Yang Jiajia.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:04.480
And Mr. Yin.

00:22:05.688 --> 00:22:06.960
I'm new to anti-abduction work.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.440
I'll be counting on your support.

00:22:08.830 --> 00:22:09.670
I object to this.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:10.840
Objection overruled.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.640
Director Deng's appointment

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.590
was posted internally a week ago.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.880
If you didn't bother
to read the updates,

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.790
don't complain now.

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.110
Listen, Chang Rui,

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:21.090
if you have a problem,
take it up with Chief Xiao.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.920
I'm just following orders.

00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:24.350
Understood?

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.720
Anything else?

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:27.870
Right, Mr. Yin.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Bring me

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.310
the old unsolved cases.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.720
Sure.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.910
This way.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.030
You sit here.

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:40.750
I'll have the rest prepared for you.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.240
Lei, Rui,

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.030
isn't she the victim of that raid?

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:48.590
That's her?

00:22:53.070 --> 00:22:54.200
Do you know how hard

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.240
we worked on the Zhou Min case?

00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.790
We built such an elaborate setup

00:22:58.270 --> 00:22:59.790
all to catch the man behind it.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.830
Then she came in

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:01.680
and ruined everything!

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.200
I just don't get it.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:05.240
How could someone like her
be our director?

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:08.680
Watch your mouth.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:11.000
This isn't like you.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.590
What do you mean?

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:33.840
Who are you?

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:35.000
Who are you?

00:23:36.177 --> 00:23:37.150
What are you doing here?

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.480
What are you doing here?

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:39.920
Stop copying me.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.400
You stop copying me.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.110
Chang Rui.

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:44.720
Did you see a little girl?

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.560
About this tall?

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.080
Shh...

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.560
Wearing two braids?

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.720
Yeah.

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:55.110
Shh...

00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.910
Here she is.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:01.430
She ran over here?

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.520
Is it her?

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.080
Look.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:07.670
Is it her?

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:08.430
That's her.

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:09.390
Who is she?

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.480
We brought her back
during yesterday's raid.

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:13.109
- What's she doing here?
- Let go of me!

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:15.333
- Let me go right now!
- We couldn't find her parents.

00:24:15.377 --> 00:24:16.390
So we had to bring her in.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.750
Let go of me!

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:18.560
The welfare center?

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:19.830
They came to pick her up,

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.320
but when I looked away, she was gone.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:22.430
Stand still.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.550
Let go!

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:25.070
- Let go of me!
- Come on, Fafa.

00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.200
Just answer a few questions,
and you can go home.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.070
I'm not going!

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.680
Come on,

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:29.480
be good.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:29.880
Okay?

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:30.310
Let's go.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.030
You big meanie!

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.160
You'll pay for this!

You're not welcome here.

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:19.240
Leave.

Mr. Lin.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.200
Please let us speak with Madam Zhang.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:24.240
What for?

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.640
She was perfectly fine.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.270
Now she's completely broken.

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:30.720
You came to laugh at us, didn't you?

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:34.510
Our Ranran was always timid.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:35.844
She never wandered off on her own.

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.200
It was because of your daughter

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.240
that we lost Ranran.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.310
It was your fault.

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:42.790
She's just a child.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:43.955
She didn't know any better.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.710
Exactly.

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:46.830
She's young. She didn't
understand anything.

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:49.310
Mr. Lin, if you must blame someone,
blame us.

00:25:49.911 --> 00:25:51.244
We'll make amends on her behalf.

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.320
Alright, then.

00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.440
Go find Ranran and bring her back.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.200
My wife went through so much

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.510
to give birth to her.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:58.640
Make amends?

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:00.177
How are you going to make amends?

Madam Zhang.

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:08.400
Why did you come out?

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.110
Ask them to leave.

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.110
Madam Zhang...

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:14.800
Get lost.

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:16.350
Madam Zhang.

Madam Zhang.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:15.070
There's a girl across the street
staring over here.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:16.440
I don't know who she is.

00:27:33.022 --> 00:27:35.444
(Welcome Home)

00:27:36.270 --> 00:27:37.160
She didn't come in.

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.640
Maybe she thought we were
closed for the day.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.080
Alright.

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.480
Let's clean up and call it a day.

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:44.790
Okay.

(It's been 24 years.)

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.640
(You've been missing for 24 years.)

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.760
(But I feel)

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.750
(closer to you than ever.)

00:28:14.350 --> 00:28:15.480
(I've never given up.)

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:17.590

See? You couldn't find me.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.200
You're so good at hiding.

00:28:58.422 --> 00:29:00.444

somewhere else to play.

Happy birthday!

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.960
I knew it was around this time.

00:29:21.350 --> 00:29:23.590
Look, I've been saving up money

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:25.270
to get you a birthday present.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.400
You love that music box, right?

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:31.550
I told you last year.

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:32.590
You still remember?

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:33.550
Of course I do.

00:29:33.688 --> 00:29:34.749
Come on, let's go buy it.

00:29:34.750 --> 00:29:35.590
Okay.

Look, I'm going to beat you!

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:43.670
I'm winning!

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:48.880
Hello, Ma'am.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.960
I want that music box.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:52.720
Here you go.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.840
Thank you.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.270
Here's five yuan.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.200
It went up one yuan this year.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.110
That will be six yuan.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.480
I don't have enough.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.830
I'll go home and get more.

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:04.440
It's your birthday today.

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.880
How could I let you go get the money?

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.720
I'll go.

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:09.030
You're the best!

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:11.160
Wait for me, okay?

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.160
(Grocery)

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:14.790
Yanyan, wait for me.

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:16.000
I will!

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.040
Little girl.

00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:20.880
You really like this music box?

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.680
It's getting late.

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.880
Why don't you take it first?

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.266
You can bring the money later.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Thank you, Ma'am.

00:30:31.044 --> 00:30:31.977
Go on now.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.950
Ranran!

Ranran!

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.030
This is all your fault!

00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.590
Ranran...

My wife went through so much

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.160
just to give birth to Ranran.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:02.280
Make amends?

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.777
How are you going to make amends?

00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:05.080
Ranran...

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.155
Go find Ranran and bring her back.

Hey, girl.

Hey.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:44.470
What is it?

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:45.680
Could you help me out?

00:31:46.844 --> 00:31:47.830
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.960
Look, I...

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:50.920
I'm not a bad guy, it's just...

00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:54.070
I have a little sister.
She's only 12 years old.

00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:55.270
And you know, girls...

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:57.480
Oh, I see.

00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.350
Yeah, so...

00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:01.680
I'm really bad at picking stuff,
so could you help me buy it?

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:05.310
Thanks.

00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:06.666
I'd really appreciate it.

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:07.910
Okay.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:08.600
Okay.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.360
Eight yuan.

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:10.320
That one's fine.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.310
I'll get going now.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.440
Here's your two yuan change.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.622
And two bottles of water.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.080
Thank you.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:25.280
No need to thank me.

00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:26.400
It's really no trouble.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.270
It's fine. You helped me out.

00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:29.577
It's just one yuan. No big deal.

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.430
Keep it.

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:31.390
Let me help you.

00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:34.150
Here.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:35.390
Thanks.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.560
Thank you, really.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.030
What are you studying?

00:32:50.444 --> 00:32:51.888
College English Level 4.

00:32:51.888 --> 00:32:52.666
English?

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:56.870
Are you okay?

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.680
I'm fine.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.520
Okay.

00:32:58.750 --> 00:33:00.310
That stuff is hard, isn't it?

00:33:01.844 --> 00:33:03.377
English is tough to learn, right?

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:15.860
(Case File)
Have a look.

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.790
The Zhou Min case

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:18.790
still hasn't been solved.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.830
(Case File)
Another girl Zheng Weiwei, was abducted.

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:21.510
We've been

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:22.880
running this crackdown

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:24.270
on abductions since early April.

00:33:24.444 --> 00:33:25.577
How many days has it been?

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:26.790
One month and 13 days.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.110
And traffickers are still

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:29.440
bold enough to strike downtown

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:31.270
and harm society.

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:46.160
The footage is way too blurry.

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.000
But judging by how he moved,

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:49.960
this guy's definitely done it before.

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:51.870
Also,

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.510
anyone doing this kind of thing
in Linshan

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:56.444
probably knows the others in the game.

00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.480
That's a good lead.

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:07.870
Officer Chang Rui,

00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:09.470
what do you think?

00:34:15.110 --> 00:34:15.950
Me?

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.710
No comments.

00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:22.550
I just follow orders.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:30.888
Alright, here's the plan.
Jiajia, Mr. Yin.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.960
Interrogate Zhao Liang.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.760
Yan Lei, you take Hu Xifan.

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:35.320
You and Officer Chang Rui

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.480
go to visit the scene.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.320
Let's split up.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:38.430
Alright.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.030
This place doesn't look like it has

00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:07.510
any clear surveillance footage.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.110
Great, another wasted trip.

00:35:10.533 --> 00:35:11.840
Wasted or not, we had to come.

00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:14.266
You know how it is. New boss, new broom.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:24.630
Where?

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:25.733
That shop right there.

00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.280
Mister.

00:35:32.155 --> 00:35:32.955
What do you need?

00:35:32.955 --> 00:35:33.680
Hello.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.320
Could you recall

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.800
around 11 PM last night,

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:38.230
did a man and woman

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.577
come here to buy something?

00:35:39.666 --> 00:35:41.400
What's your relationship
with Zhao Liang?

00:35:41.422 --> 00:35:42.120
Zhao Liang?

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.200
Yes, Zhao Liang.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:44.960
He's the one who kidnaps people.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.150
That's his thing.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.160
I just...

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.590
I just connect him
with some clients, that's all.

00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:51.280
Earn a small referral fee, nothing more.

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:52.439
I've got nothing to do with it.

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.110
(Linshan City Detention Center)
Hu Xifan.

00:35:54.111 --> 00:35:55.600
I'm going to ask you one last time.

00:35:55.822 --> 00:35:57.844
What's your relationship
with Zhao Liang?

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.600
And

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:01.150
do you remember the girl

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:02.355
you kidnapped last night?

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.230
Pretty face.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.120
Very pretty.

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.550
She looked

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:12.190
25-26 years old.

00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:13.030
I'm telling you,

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.200
the plan was to grab

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.630
someone 13-14 years old.

00:36:16.733 --> 00:36:18.533
The deal fell through
at the last minute.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.800
Then this dumb mule

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:22.480
walked right into our hands.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:24.430
That face,

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:25.590
and that figure...

00:36:25.590 --> 00:36:27.422
At the very least,
she's premium merchandise.

00:36:27.444 --> 00:36:28.755
We've hit the jackpot.

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:30.710
She's actually a police officer.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:33.190
You know what it means
to kidnap a officer, right?

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:34.200
Think hard.

00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.070
This is your last chance to come clean.

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.360
No, no... I'll talk!

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:38.130
I...

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:42.760
I have a handler.

00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.200
He's called...

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:48.030
He's called

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.280
Whiteboard.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.510
The police already questioned me
this morning.

00:36:51.777 --> 00:36:53.666
I even gave them
the surveillance footage.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.110
We get lots of customers every day.

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:57.000
It was late.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.030
Honestly, I didn't get a clear look.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.320
Whose black car is that?

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.760
No idea.

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:13.230
It's been parked there for days.

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.720
How do you know?

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:16.320
I've been working in the shop,

00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:18.920
and playing near it with my classmates
these past few days.

00:37:22.110 --> 00:37:22.950
Let's go.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.860
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.360
According to Zhao Liang's statement,

00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.880
(Zhao Liang, Bald, Trafficker/Transport)
he was working under Hu Xifan.

00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.000
(Hu Xifan, "Doctor")
He followed all orders from Hu.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
But beyond that,
he claims to know nothing.

00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.630
Hu Xifan, however, admitted

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.230
that Whiteboard is his handler.

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.133
(Whiteboard)
Apparently, Whiteboard once said

00:37:39.133 --> 00:37:40.190
he had a big job coming up,

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.444
one he'd handle personally.

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:43.110
And he prefers using

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.280
sedatives.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.280
Well,

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.320
that matches the Zheng Weiwei case.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:50.230
(Victims: Zhou Min, Zheng Weiwei)

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:51.320
If we can prove

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.670
that Whiteboard was involved
in the Zheng Weiwei case,

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.510
then we can apply

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.133
to combine that case with Zhou Min's.

00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:01.960
But right now, in the Zheng Weiwei case,

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.760
we don't have concrete evidence tying it

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.280
directly to Whiteboard.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:07.022
And the surveillance footage
is so blurry.

00:38:07.044 --> 00:38:08.280
Hu Xifan couldn't confirm

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.666
whether he is Whiteboard or not.

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:24.260

Contact the car owner.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:28.320
On it.

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.280
Do you recognize this man?

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.200
Sit down.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:43.240
Yes.

00:38:43.688 --> 00:38:45.000
That's him. That's Whiteboard.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.800
He's the ringleader.

00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:50.320
I was just a follower.

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:52.550
Whatever he told us to do, we did.

00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:54.590
So, Officer,

00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.400
if I tell you everything I know,

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.880
can I...

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:59.000
Just answer our questions.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.510
Sure, I'll answer your questions.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:07.288
Have you seen this girl before?

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.710
I... don't remember.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.030
Think carefully.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:24.550
Take a good look.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.360
I think

00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:34.760
it was about a month ago.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.200
Well...

00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.840
I checked...

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.440
No, no...

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.510
Well, I...

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:40.440
I...

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:41.880
I think I saw that girl.

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:44.110
Then Whiteboard came and took her away.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.320
As for where they went,

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.360
I really don't know.

00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:03.400
According to Hu Xifan's confession,

00:40:03.444 --> 00:40:05.911
the man who abducted Zheng Weiwei
in the video was Whiteboard.

00:40:05.933 --> 00:40:06.955
Bai Wentao.

00:40:07.066 --> 00:40:08.888
The big fish we tried to catch
last time.

00:40:09.266 --> 00:40:11.200
(Case Connection Diagram: Whiteboard)
Now it's confirmed,

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.200
Zheng Weiwei's case
is also tied to Whiteboard.

00:40:13.244 --> 00:40:15.150
So I suggest we merge
the Zheng Weiwei case

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:15.990
with Zhou Min's.

00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:17.390
Okay.

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:19.760
That means your team

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.670
needs to find Whiteboard
as quickly as possible.

00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:23.400
Based on what we know so far,

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.590
he has more than just

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:26.880
Zhou Min and Zheng Weiwei in his hands.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.360
I approve of merging the two cases.

00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:34.420
(Han Liang)

Everyone,

00:40:35.688 --> 00:40:36.760
Captain Han has approved

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.670
merging the Zheng Weiwei
and Zhou Min cases.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.150
Whiteboard is now our primary suspect.

00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:42.630
To catch him,

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:44.030
we need more evidence against him.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.000
Mr. Yin,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.320
go dig through older cases.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.710
See if any tie back to Whiteboard.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:48.840
Got it.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.400
Jiajia, go through the footage,

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.244
and see if anything matches Whiteboard.

00:40:52.311 --> 00:40:53.000
Yes.

00:40:53.550 --> 00:40:55.110
Chang Rui, you've got a wide network.

00:40:55.266 --> 00:40:57.200
See if you can dig up leads
on Whiteboard.

00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:59.430
Yan Lei.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:01.600

go question Zhao Liang again.

00:41:01.622 --> 00:41:02.350
Okay.

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:10.070

Whiteboard.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:12.680
Do you know him well?

Whiteboard is your handler.

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:28.880
If you want to redeem yourself,

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:30.840
you'd better come clean now.

00:41:32.710 --> 00:41:34.160
Okay, I'll talk.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:35.840
I'll talk.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.320
It's true.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:39.800
Whiteboard is my handler.

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:41.630
Hu and I

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.070
were just his runners.

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.870
But

00:41:45.110 --> 00:41:46.230
I didn't deal with him much.

00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:48.440
I don't even know his real name.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:49.800
Seriously.

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:51.350
What else?

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.840
That little girl you brought in,

00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.280
Fafa.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.150
She calls Whiteboard "Dad".

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:02.630
So she must be his daughter, right?

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.880
She's always with him.

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.711
She must know a lot.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.240
I think

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.280
you guys should question that kid.

00:42:10.380 --> 00:42:11.980
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.720
According to Zhao Liang,

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.360
Fafa was adopted by Whiteboard.

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:16.630
So I'm thinking,

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:18.150
maybe through Fafa,

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:20.280
we can learn something about Whiteboard.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:23.320
But Fafa

00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:25.760
has lived with Whiteboard all her life.

00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.030
Her personality's strange.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.190
She even thinks we police
are the bad guys.

00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:30.920
I'm a police officer.

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:32.030
Let me take you home, okay?

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.240
Stop her!

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.710
Let me go!

it'll be really hard to get anything

out of her about Whiteboard.

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.110
But don't you all find it odd?

00:42:44.710 --> 00:42:45.920
A trafficker like Whiteboard,

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.155
how could he legally adopt a child?

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:49.800
Or is the child

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.230
a relative's kid?

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:53.070
