00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.280
Min Min is that my name?

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.720
Hey you.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.440
Ren intended to hurt me from
the perfume photoshoot onwards.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.600
He used the entertainment media
he controls as a weapon to damage me,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.880
to ruin my reputation.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.160
Can you please tell Mr.Tada

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
not to press charges against my mom
that will make her go bankrupt?

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.520
It was you and your mother
who committed those evil acts.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.880
You’re not going to help me?

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.400
You still have a chance to win.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.400
I’ll cooperate with you.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.920
Take revenge on Armin and Tada.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.240
Why would Thiwthit do something like that?

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.280
He wanted to hurt me.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.960
But he’s your younger brother.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.360
We are not the same blood.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.080
It’s truly a pleasure that
the two of us get to work together.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.200
What's up Phat?

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:53.520
Hah?

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.760
Auntie Jeed fell?

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.360
Which hospital is she at?

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.560
It was just a fall, did you really have
to bring me to the hospital?

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.519
I’m not seriously hurt, am I?

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.560
You’re already dead.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.240
You little rascal watch that mouth of yours.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.640
Uh huh.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.920
There you go, see? Still pretty strong, right.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.840
Min.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.440
Min.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.800
Hey.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.320
How did Auntie end up falling?

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.560
Well, she was organizing the shop
when she fainted and fell.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.680
Probably overworked.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.120
Doctor, how is Aunt Jeed’s condition?

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.960
There are some minor abrasions,

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.840
and externally everything looks normal.
However, internally..

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.720
Kidney disease.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.160
Yes, the patient is already at stage three kidney disease.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.840
This could affect the heartbeat
or even cause the heart to stop.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.560
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Do you want to eat anything?

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.280
It’s supposed to take another 5 years
for her to be diagnosed with kidney disease.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.800
Why is everything happening faster
than when I reset my life?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.400
- Past Life.
- She’s already in the final stage of the illness.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.480
Thank you.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.240
Auntie, do you want to eat anything?

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.920
Would you like some soy milk,
I will buy it for you?

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.720
When I’m not around,
please take care of yourself.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.600
Thank you, Auntie.

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.280
Don’t worry about me.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.400
I can take care of myself.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:37.720
Phat.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.160
Yes, Auntie.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.800
I want to see Armin.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.120
I miss him.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.200
Yes, Auntie.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.079
Are you ready? All crew are set.

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:52.880
Min.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.720
I have something important to talk to you about.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.400
Please give me a minute.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.480
Hurry up, The whole crew is waiting for you.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.160
Yes.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.280
What's going on?

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.880
Auntie Jeed’s really sick,
she really wants to see you.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.280
One last time.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.400
Armin.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.000
We're ready.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.840
Yes sir.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.079
Hey I'm so sorry. But I can't make it right now.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.360
But it might already be too late.

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.720
Let’s go.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.320
Min.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.960
Armin.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.160
Auntie Jeed’s gonna die soon.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.440
Hey hurry up, call actors on set.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.600
Just like we rehearsed, okay?
What we briefed before.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.440
Excuse me, please.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.320
We’re filming a movie.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.240
Everyone, please make way.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.160
Excuse me, please.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.800
We’re filming a movie.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.520
Please clear the way.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.520
Armin, the whole team is ready now,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:49.840
come on set.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.320
Phat.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.880
Just get out of here.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.600
Min, you bastard!

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.880
Get out of here.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.080
Go.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.440
I told you to go.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.080
Calm down.

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.640
Get out!

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.040
You don't have to respect.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.240
Leave.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:14.880
Go right now.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.880
I'm sorry.

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.920
Min.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.480
- What's wrong?
- I don’t know.

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.600
- Min.
- Min.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.920
- Hurry up.
- Come here.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.000
Look at him.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.159
Are you hurt anywhere, Auntie?

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.120
Butt hurts.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.280
Let me give you a massage.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.480
Are you gonna massage my butt?

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.000
Come on then, I’ll lie face down for you.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.960
Oh...

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.680
What kind of question is that?
Where does it hurt?

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.960
I’ve got no inheritance to leave you, you know.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.840
Auntie, if I wanted something in return,

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.760
I’d go do good things for someone else.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.000
Ouch!.. Auntie.

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:00.320
You little rascal.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.600
I mean I want to take care of you because
I really care, not because I expect anything.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.600
Auntie, from now on, you have to eat
only good, healthy food, okay.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.960
Those salty snacks and overly flavored junk foods,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.640
if you can quit them, please quit.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.840
Ugh…

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.600
How’s life supposed to have any flavor like this, huh?

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.480
Auntie…

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:20.760
Don’t you want to stay with me
for a long, long time?

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.920
Alright, alright…

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.920
I’ll try to cut down on it. Okay?

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.840
And you, go back to work.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.720
No need to babysit an old hag like me,
I’m tough, not gonna kick the bucket that easy.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:36.880
Auntie...

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.760
Death is more unpredictable than we think.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.320
From now on,

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.080
I’ll take care of your health myself, Okay?

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.680
If everything in this reset world happens faster

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.480
then I’ll be the one to slow it down.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.600
We’ve also got that scene
over here that we need to shoot.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.280
Yes sir.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:34.800
Here.

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.520
I’ve already taken care of it.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.920
Armin, Hello.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:38.760
Hello.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.640
We have a reshoot scheduled for today.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.120
Which scene is it?

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.360
This one.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.040
Have we already found
a actor that replace Ren?

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.360
Yes sir, He should be on his way.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.480
Narin, say hello to your colleage.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.480
Hello.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.960
Why the shocked face?

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.320
Oh!

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.320
Two tigers can’t share the same den.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.080
But anyway, congratulation
on your rapid rise to fame.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.600
In the entertainment world,
what goes up must come down.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.880
If you ever change your mind and want to
sign back with Venus, just let me know.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.960
You’ll always be welcome.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.600
Thank you.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.360
Excuse me, Mr. Thiwthit and Mr. Narin,
could you please come this way?

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.480
Why is Narin replacing Ren?

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:08.960
Fire him immediately.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:10.440
We can't do that, sir.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:18.600
I know Thiwthit was the one who made the deal
with the sponsor to get Narin in.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.280
And the media found out
because Ren told his mom to leak it.

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.360
So, you expect me to just stay quiet.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.160
Yes, sir.

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.000
If we replace the actor now,
next time we’ll get hit even harder.

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.880
This game is starting to get interesting.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:39.080
Wenai, get the car ready.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.360
Where are you going?

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.960
I'm going to end this game.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.320
Well, well…

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.080
the mysterious big brother finally shows up.

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.360
How can I be of service to you?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.120
I want you to stop spreading
those rumors about me and Armin.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.080
I know you’re the one behind all of this.

00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.720
But your dirty tactics
will drag both Crown and Venus down.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.080
Just Crown.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:53.120
Thiwthit, I’m warning you
because I still hope you’ll stop.

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.960
But if you keep playing this filthy game.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.360
You’ll end up with nothing.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.360
Not even a place to sleep.

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:05.840
Stop it while you still can.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.360
So impressive.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.600
If you’re that great,

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.800
then try and stop me

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.080
because I’m not stopping for you.

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:24.960
Venus will rise above Crown.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.240
Remember that.

00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.880
Thank you for...

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.600
the coffee.

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:00.920
Hello…

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.080
what time do you get off work today?

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.760
If you’re free after, do you want
to grab dinner together?

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.080
I am heading to an event,
but I’m not sure when it’ll be done.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.640
I’ll call you once I know, okay?

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.800
Okay then.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:14.120
When you’re done just give me a call.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:28.800
Hello?

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.080
It’s me.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.280
I want to see you.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:35.720
Where are you right now?

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:44.080
Thank you for joining us.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.000
Thank you.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.800
In my past life after Aunt Jeed died,

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.880
Phat got deep into gambling.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.400
His life just kept spiraling down.

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.680
He ended up as nothing more than
a day worker in some kitchen

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.160
leaving behind his dream of becoming a chef.

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.760
Hello Min.

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.680
Holy sh*t!!!

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.120
Why the hell did you call me here?

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.960
A culinary school.

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.400
What’s going on?

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:10.200
Didn’t you say you wanted to be a chef?

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:11.600
Then you have to study for it.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:12.600
Whoa, dude!

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.240
If you wanna open your own place,

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.960
you need a proper certificate, man.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.680
Otherwise, it’s gonna be tough for you later on.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.480
I want you to make
your dream come true, being a real chef.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.560
But it must be really expensive.
I can’t afford to study here, man.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.040
I already signed you up.

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.640
Pay me back whenever. No rush.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.960
F**k, Min…

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.120
F**k, Min…

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.640
Why the hell would you do this, man?

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.080
Are you that rich or something?

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.000
But promise me, alright?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.640
I don’t want things to end up
the same way again.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.520
I want the future to be different.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.600
So you better finish this course. Alright, man.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.240
For you, I’ll give it everything I’ve got.

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:51.320
Give me a hug.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.360
Enough already.

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.760
- Thanks a lot, Bro, Thanks.
- Don’t shake me!

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.760
I just got this. No, don’t!

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.200
What's that?

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.880
Isn’t it cute?

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.120
Who’re you giving it to?

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.080
None of your business.

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.560
Mr. Tada.

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.920
Damn, bro, you’re so sweet.

00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:11.120
Makes me wanna go home
and have someone bring me food,

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.440
- Just stop it already.
- buy me stuff, cuddle me, kiss me.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:13.400
- Give it back.
- buy me stuff, cuddle me, kiss me.

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:14.640
Hey!!! Not yours!

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:32.880
Hello.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.480
Hello Mr. Tada.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.720
I know Tada well.

00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:07.720
He gets bored easily.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.400
In the end, you’ll just become
another toy he tosses aside just like Narin.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.119
Maybe I really can’t change the future.

00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.560
No matter what I do, I’m still
destined to be betrayed, aren’t I?

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:41.400
Why didn’t you pick up my call?

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.240
Armin.

00:17:58.920 --> 00:17:59.720
Armin.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:01.840
I'm coming in.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.560
Darling.

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.120
Armin.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.080
Armin.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.120
Armin...

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.040
Why didn’t you?

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.320
I don’t want to be disappointed again.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:02.000
I don’t want to be anyone’s toy anymore.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.520
Please don’t leave me.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.160
Hey Armin.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.960
Wait a minute!

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.480
Where are you going?

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:25.720
No.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.320
Wait please wait.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:33.960
So…

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.520
you really are mad at me.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:41.320
No.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.320
Armin.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.120
I don’t know what kind of pain
or past you’ve been through?

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.320
But I want you to know
I’ve never seen you as a toy.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.560
Why did you go see Narin?

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.000
You’re really upset.

00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:36.440
Honestly, I’m kinda happy you’re jealous.

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.680
No.

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.120
Seriously, why did you go see him?

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.840
I went to talk to him regarding Venus.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:51.840
What did Thiwthit make you do?

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:56.280
All I can say is, you and Armin
need to be careful.

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.280
But there’s nothing specific.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.680
You have to trust me.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:33.760
I’ve been yours ever since you saved my life.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.120
You saved my life too.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.640
I will trust you.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.880
Everything ready.

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.080
Then take care of it.

00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.840
Alright, this time let’s rehearse the blocking first.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.320
Okay, ready? Actors, let’s try running through it.

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.800
I’m sorry…

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.560
but I can’t be your stand-in anymore.

00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.080
Please… let me go. I’m begging you.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.760
If you leave, you die.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.080
Or stay and be my stand-in.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.120
Choose. I said, choose.

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.160
I said, choose.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.520
Hold this timing for a moment
and then slowly start to pressure him.

00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.480
Jira pressures.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.320
The power is in your hands now. Shoot.

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.600
- Like this…and you get scared.
- I said, shoot.

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.240
Ah! Bang then falls to the ground.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.000
That’s the scene get the blanks ready.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.080
Crew, please do a final check.

00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.800
On the way….

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.160
First take we shoot with the empty prop.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.560
Final check, please wardrobe and makeup.

00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:18.280
Once you’re done, back to position quickly.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:20.560
Props enter….

00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.160
Let’s go! Get the gun ready.

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.200
First take we shoot with the empty prop,

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.840
second take we’ll add the effects.

00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.960
All set? Okay.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:34.000
Guns ready come out quickly.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.040
Go!!! Set.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.320
Actors standby.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.480
Alright, let’s do this. Everyone ready.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.560
Ready set,

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.880
Five Four Three Two...

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.080
Action!

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.480
I’m sorry.

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.280
But I can’t be your stand-in anymore.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:54.360
If you leave, you die.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.560
Choose.

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.760
I said, choose.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.760
The power is in your hands now.

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.200
The power is in your hands now. Shoot.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.560
- Please don’t force me to do this.
- I said, shoot.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.640
Please don’t force me to do this.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.360
Armin.

00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.800
- Assistant come and check Armin please.
- Armin.

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.000
Armin...

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.800
- Armin.
- Call an ambulance right now!

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.480
Call an ambulance.

00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:56.560
Call it now.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.280
Call an ambulance.

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.600
Am I dying again?

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.160
It’s strange I’m no longer afraid of death.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.880
What scares me is not seeing you again, Tada.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.440
Stay with me first. Stay with me Armin.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:18.120
In this new life I’ve been given,
I wish I had more time with you.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.120
Goodbye, Tada.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.200
Maybe I really can’t change my fate after all.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.840
Where is the ambulance?

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.240
Stay strong, Armin.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.680
Stay strong, Armin.

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.800
Mr. Tada.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:52.960
Armin.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.200
You’re safe now.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.080
You’re safe now.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:07.880
You saved my life once again.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.880
Are you hurting anywhere else?

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.240
Just tell me.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.480
But from the X-ray results,

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.960
the bullet didn’t hit any vital organs.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:30.160
However, the doctors here might not
have done a thorough enough check.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.240
Wenai.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:35.960
Wenai.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.320
Check my doctor’s schedule at my regular hospital.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.040
I’m gonna move Armin there.

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:46.440
Yes sir.

00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.600
Hey!

00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:50.960
I’m safe now.

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.200
I’ve come back to you now.

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.440
I was so worried about you, Armin.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.080
It hurts.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.440
I'm so so sorry. I'm sorry.

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.200
You can worry, but gently, you know.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.360
Are you okay?

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.440
Are you hungry?

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.280
Good morning.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.720
Breakfast for the patient is here.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:41.520
Here.

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.680
Thank you so much, let me handle it.

00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:47.440
Okay. May I adjust the bed?

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.920
- Armin.
- Are you okay?

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.000
I will take care of him.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.320
Okay, Sir.

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:59.320
Then the patient will eat and take your medicine.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.960
Please wait for the doctor to come and examine.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.720
Thank you.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.920
I think I'm the one who can take the best care of him.

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.240
Okay.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.960
Can you stop overbearing
the nurse’s responsibilities?

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.640
Overbearing?

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.280
Um…Does the patient want something else?

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.560
Never mind. Thank you.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.680
Oh yes.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.840
Go ahead and eat.

00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.640
Have some water first.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.760
Enough, babe.

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:37.880
You’ll choke if you’re not careful.

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.320
Any updates on the investigation, Wenai?

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:46.600
Did Mr. Armin have any known enemies before?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.440
Or… could it be from the interview you gave previously?

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:59.520
The only ones affected by my interview were...

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.280
So what exactly happened that day?

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.760
What happened?

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.480
He just paid me to switch the bullets in the gun.
That’s all. I didn’t know they were real.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.440
And who paid you to do it?

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.160
Who?

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.680
- It was a celebrity.
- Hah.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.640
- Who?
- An actor named Ren hired me.

00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:17.200
Mr. A (alias), a props assistant
from Deep Depths film set,

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.640
has confessed to secretly swapping real bullets
into a prop gun used during a scene.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:28.400
He claims he was hired by Ren,
an actor currently in conflict with Armin.

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.600
Ren did it.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.600
It wasn’t just him.

00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.000
He planned it together with Thiwthit.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.120
How do you know that?

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.640
Narin.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:50.440
I had Narin pretend to accept Thiwthit’s offer
so he could investigate for me.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:59.160
Narin went looking for evidence to find out
what Thiwthit and Ren were really planning.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.960
And that’s when he discovered…

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.840
they were intentionally trying to hurt you.

00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.960
I can’t believe...

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.320
they would go this far.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:22.480
You don’t have to worry.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:26.080
These people won’t be able to hurt you anymore.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:39.520
A props assistant from
Deep Depths film set,

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.960
has confessed to secretly swapping real bullets
into a prop gun used during a scene.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:47.400
He claims he was hired by Ren,
an actor currently in conflict with Armin.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.080
It must’ve been that damn Narin. He’s the mole.
He’s working with Tada for sure.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.520
You brought him into this.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.080
One way or another, you have to take responsibility.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.480
My mom’s done with this now.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.920
You need to find a scapegoat to take the fall.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.520
Where the hell am I supposed to find someone?

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.800
This is all over the news
who the hell would dare take the blame.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.320
I don’t know, damn it!

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:08.240
But if you can’t find someone, then get ready
to rot in jail with me for conspiracy.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.760
Conspiracy charges, it’s up to you now.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.880
Police have arrested “Phawadee”, the wife of
the former president of Crown Enterprises,

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.200
who is linked to stock fraud.

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.960
And the disappearance of Thiwthit, the son,

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.760
suspected of being involved with Ren, an actor

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.320
- Go ahead talk to the boss yourself.
- suspected of being involved with Ren, an actor

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.679
behind the accidental shooting
on the set of the film Deep Depths.

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:16.600
They are charged with attempted murder of
Armin Tiwanon, the lead actor in the story.

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.880
Nine hundred thousand for the two of you.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.400
Shit!

00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.400
Are you trying to take advantage of me?

00:34:25.679 --> 00:34:26.480
Hey!

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.639
Caught in a case like this, are you in or not?

00:34:31.239 --> 00:34:34.679
It counts as attempted murder,
no way out for sure.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:36.800
The bail should be even higher than this, man.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:38.600
Alright!

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:42.920
Take half of my share,
then you can get the car out.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.600
Get in.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.159
Hey!

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.719
What about me?

00:34:56.719 --> 00:34:58.120
I was the one who brought you here.

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.400
So what now?

00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.400
That lousy deal dragged me down like this.

00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:08.600
You said it was just a threat,
so what the hell is that real bullet about.

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:15.640
Sorry, don’t mean to scare you both.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:19.040
Just saying, hurry up the real deal is on its way.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:32.760
Hey, what’s up?

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.280
If you’re leaving, bring the money.

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.080
Here.

00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:47.040
That's all it takes.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:48.880
Get in.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:17.080
No Sign of Former Venus Executive 'Thiwthit'
in ‘Armin’ Murder Mastermind Case.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:50.200
Are you still in pain?

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.840
Not anymore.

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:58.080
Any updates from the police.

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:00.440
Nothing.

00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:04.200
Phawadee still refuses to give any further statements.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.920
I guess… all we can do is wait.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.800
I'm so worried.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:17.520
Stop worrying.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.680
I’m right here safe and sound, in front of you.

00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:30.520
Is this the reason you had Janine put me
on your schedule to watch over you at work?

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.360
Yes. Because we still
can’t trust anything just yet.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:41.600
And… I don’t want anyone
harming you ever again.

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.400
Also… I just want you close to me.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.800
Close enough?

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:06.640
Is this close enough?

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:12.840
About that second wish you granted me.

00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.760
Do I still get to use it?

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.840
It’s valid for life.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.240
No Limit.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:39.120
Mr. Armin sir.

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:46.520
Uh…

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.680
Excuse me. Janine just called me…

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.520
He needs you back on set right away, Mr. Armin.

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.160
Apparently, there’s a kiss scene...

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.920
I mean, an action scene.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.320
- Yes! An action scene!
- Wenai!!!

00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.480
Yes sir.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.400
Do you know what to do?

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.920
Yes, sir. I know what to do.
I’ll take care of it right away.

00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.480
Okay.

00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:15.440
Janine...

00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.800
Mr. Armin is currently stuck
in a kiss scene, I mean..

00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:21.280
He’s, uh… in the middle of
an important mission right now.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.160
This scene...

00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:36.240
They call it “kiss-meets-explosion-destroys-the-world”
kind of thing.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:08.360
What the hell is going on?

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.520
Bodyguards all over the set
who brought them in?

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.520
Yeah, seriously, who gave the order?

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.440
What? You should know!
You’re the assistant director.

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.000
How could you let them swarm
the whole set like this?

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.480
- Everything all set?
- Who did it?

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:19.680
All clear, sir.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.680
We’ve checked everything.

00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:21.880
It’s safe no issues

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:23.840
Armin.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.480
Please, don’t walk by yourself.

00:40:28.480 --> 00:40:30.720
Hello, Armin. Hello Mr. Tada.

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.280
Welcome… to our battlefield.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.120
I'm just kidding.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.920
With this setup, it’s going to be
hard for everyone to work.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.560
It’s not really hard.
Everyone’s just feeling tense, that’s all.

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:48.360
Right?

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.400
I'm okay.

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:51.920
Allright, I’ll go prep the set inside first.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:55.400
Once the area’s secure,
I’ll have an assistant come get you.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.160
Let’s go.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:57.640
Come on…

00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.520
What the...

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:02.320
I’m the director.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.360
This is the assistant.

00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:05.000
Obviously not carrying weapons.

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:06.520
Can we go in now?

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.680
Let’s go.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.240
Waste time.

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.400
Huh…

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.040
What a nuisance!

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.560
I really think this is too much.

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:21.200
How about just keeping two or three people inside.

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:23.120
And the rest can guard outside.

00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:25.520
I feel bad for everyone on set like this.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.000
Who’s going to be able to concentrate
with all this going on?

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.760
- But uh…
- Please!!!

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:53.480
If that’s what you want.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:54.440
If that’s what you want.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:56.440
I’ll go along with it.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.800
Thank you.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.400
Then tonight, I will go along
with whatever you want.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.320
I'm going to work now.

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:13.520
How about you?

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.160
I canceled all my work at Crown.

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.960
Just so I could be here for you.

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.680
Your personal bodyguard.

00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:25.680
Let's go.

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.040
Wenai.

00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:34.920
Yes sir.

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.520
Maintain full security coverage
of the filming area as before.

00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:39.680
Yes sir.

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:53.720
Mr. Armin, the producers have left
a script for your next casting.

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:55.960
Please have a look.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.440
Thank you.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.640
Oh! It’s starting to rain.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.200
Move the actors inside.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:09.960
Crew, help pack up quickly.

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:14.720
We’ll take a short break
and resume filming once the rain stops.

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.760
I’m going to run some lines for a bit.

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:33.280
Would you like to come with me?

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.520
I’ll come with you.

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.760
Why did you do this to me?

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:57.440
You know how much I love you.

00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:04.600
He slaps her… but then pulls her into a kiss,
full of passion.

00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.440
Wait…

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.240
Do you really have to kiss the actor for real?

00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.720
Yeah… it’s part of the role.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:27.240
Hey, will you be my scene partner for practice?

00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.840
Why did you do this to me?

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.880
You know how much I love you.

00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.960
This… in drama terms,
is called a slap-and-kiss scene.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.840
Thanks for helping me rehearse
I will head back to set now

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:21.760
Cut, It's okay Actors, please go get changed.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.080
We’re moving on to the next scene.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.280
Go ahead.

00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.480
Armin, you’ve got another scene coming up.

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:34.120
Also, bring Narin with you
he’s in the next scene too.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.520
Mr. Narin.

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.600
Thank you for helping me about Ren.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:42.880
I'm helping Tada.

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.880
I just didn’t want to leave any debts behind.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.240
He helped me a lot too.

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.640
I know you love him.

00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.840
But he only loves you.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.520
Today’s the final scene.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.920
I guess we won’t see each other again.

00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.120
I hope you find a love that truly deserves you.

00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:03.760
Thank you… for everything you did for us.

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:07.880
Narin, this way please.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:08.800
Yes.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.840
Oh sorry sorry.

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:25.800
- Are you okay?
- Armin, I'm so so sorry.

00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:33.240
Wenai!!!

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:42.680
Ow!!!

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:44.520
Catch him.

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.360
Hey what are you gonna do to me?

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.120
Take him.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:51.200
Hey hey what’re you gonna do? Help me please.

00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:54.480
Tada What are you doing?

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.440
I’m going to find out who sent him.

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.640
He’s a props assistant.

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:04.800
How do you know that, Armin?

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.520
I’ll show you.

00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:09.960
Look at this. See.

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.480
Stop Stop!!!

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.120
Believe me now.

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:29.440
I don’t care I have to check, for your safety.

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:31.400
Tada.

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:34.080
I need to talk to you now. Let’s go.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:34.760
Wait.

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.680
Armin.

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.160
Come.

00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:40.040
Why do I have to…

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.760
You’re abusing your authority.

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:56.160
I did it because I want to take care of you and protect you.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.680
You’re being immature. Get a grip.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:19.040
If you keep acting like this,
people on set will start to see you differently.

00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:22.640
That guy’s been here since day one.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:24.080
It was an accident.

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:25.960
Tone down your worries.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.000
If you want respect on set.

00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:30.200
Chairman of Crown.

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.960
I don’t need their respect.

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:35.680
I just want to protect you.

00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:37.960
I don’t want anything like before to happen again.

00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:46.360
I... I am sorry.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:54.920
I'll let him go.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.040
Now.

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.400
Now.

00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:12.720
Okay.

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:42.920
I’m sorry.

00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:44.480
Please don’t hurt me.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.360
I know I was wrong. I’m really sorry.

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:50.960
Don’t hurt me please. I'm so scared.

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:52.520
I'm sorry.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.560
Oh, it’s okay.

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.040
I misunderstood you.

00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:00.600
It's fine I'm okay.

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:08.000
Hey, please don’t please
don’t do anything to me.

00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:10.160
I am begging you, don't hurt me please.

00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:21.920
This is a compensation for the shock.

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.760
It’s okay, I don’t have to accept it.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:27.640
I’m okay, really. It’s nothing, truly.

00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.760
Oh, I’ll take it then.

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.720
But I have something to ask for your help with.

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.320
Tada asked me to give this to you.

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:48.680
Tada?

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:49.680
Yes.

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:52.120
Mr. Tada has apologized to me
for the misunderstanding.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:56.960
Please excuse me now.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.480
When you’re free,
come meet me by the car : TD.

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:05.600
Is it like the love you had in your past life?

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:10.080
I’m was just telling you a story.
Did you prepare all this for me?

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.360
Do you remember what I told you?

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.880
First wish.

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.880
No matter what I give you.

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:18.920
You have to accept it.

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:23.400
That’s not so hard, is it?

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.720
But it’s different, not quite the same.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:30.000
How so?

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:37.360
Because here it’s not food support,
it’s fan support.

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.760
Thank you.

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:51.840
Well then…

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:00.440
Here’s…

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:04.240
a fan feeding you.

00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:15.960
is it good?

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.000
Have some more.

00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:29.800
Eat more, eat a lot more!

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:36.160
Filming for Deep Depths is already halfway through.

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:40.760
And we’ve got some insider news from the set.
Armin has been receiving overwhelming support.

00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:48.720
Especially from a mysterious fan who sent a food truck
with meals and drinks to support him and the crew.

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:52.400
The cast is touched, the crew is well-fed.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:57.840
We can’t help but feel a little jealous over here.
Maybe some fans can send a food truck our way too!

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:41.800
Hey, I know you’re worried.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:45.080
But do you really have
to watch me even in the bathroom?

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.760
You traveled back in time.

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:54.200
Just to face the harsh realities of my family.

00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.480
I came back to love you.

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:02.400
To be by your side.

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.240
We’ll get through this together.

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.280
Showering together.

00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:13.720
Drying each other’s hair.

00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:17.040
And sleep while holding each other that’s enough.

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.920
Let me help bathe you.
