00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:45.451

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.190
Father?

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.720
Deceased?

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.520
It's me, dad.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.120
Something, when you know it,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.040
might take all your
happiness away.

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.610
Remember!

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.480
Hello?

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.280
Hello?

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.840
Can you hear me?

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.440
Hello?

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.800
Can you hear me?

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.160
Dad.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.400
Hello?

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.600
Alan?

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.400
Is that you?

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.340
Who exactly are you?

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.320
Alan, calm down.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.900
Where are you?

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.120
How did you call me?

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.180
Calm down, Alan.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.240
What's going on?

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.080
Where are you now?

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:14.880
Calm down?

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.600
My father has died,

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.329
it is stated in the medical record!

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.320
Alan.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:21.959
Calm down.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.440
Who exactly am I?

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.720
Listen to me first.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.400
- Who the hell am I?
- Wait! Alan.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.480
Hear me out!

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.050
- A clone?
- Where are you?

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.840
Take it easy.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.910
Am I a clone?

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:32.780
Calm down.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.380
How many clones
have been created?

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.770
How many times
has this happened?

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.320
- Alan, listen to me.
- Tell me what this is all about!

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.409
Tell me!

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.530
There, get him!

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.090
Quick!

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.760
Tell me, hurry!

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.800
Tell me!

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.150
Get him out!

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.010
Let go!

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.040
I said let go!

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.330
Take him back to his room now.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.310
Yes, Doctor Nil.

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:53.520
Pete, Doctor Nil,

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.520
Both of you.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.909
Let go of me!

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.640
Release me!

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.200
Stop causing trouble.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.240
Please cooperate.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.730
Alan, calm down.

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.040
Let's get you back
to the room, alright?

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.440
Alan.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:11.310
Alan, calm yourself down.

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.160
ALAN!

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.070
Hold him still.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.890
Let go!

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.920
Hold him.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:21.620
Let go!

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:22.400
Let go, damn it.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.960
I'm a clone, right?

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.080
- Which number of clone am I?
- Stop talking nonsense!

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.600
Please don't do
this to me, Doctor.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.120
Let me go.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.120
Doctor Nil.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:51.159
I feel like things are starting
to get out of hand now.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.640
The time has come.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.560
Alan.

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:16.960
Alan.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.840
With me, Pete.

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.560
Get up slowly, Alan.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.280
Easy there.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.560
Can you recall anything
about last night?

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.320
Last night?

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.520
Last night...

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.230
Let go!

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.010
Alan!

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.710
- Alan.
- Let go of me.

00:06:58.730 --> 00:06:59.090
Stop!

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.260
- Alan, stop!
- Stop right there.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:01.570
Stay where you are, all of you.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.390
Stop.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.710
Don't come any closer.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.280
What've you guys been
scheming against me?

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.320
Tell me right now.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.200
Take a deep breath, Alan.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.240
No, you're going to tell me!

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.160
What are you people
up to against me?

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:17.010
Answer me now.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.920
Anyway, who are you?

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.280
You're not my dad.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.520
My father has died.

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:22.610
Who are you?

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:23.600
Who the hell are you?

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.920
Just tell me the truth.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.320
Say it!

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.040
Fuckin' tell me!

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.810
- Do you want to know the whole truth now?
- Sure shit!

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:36.040
- Tell me right now!
- Please calm down.

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.800
Today, you'll learn the
truth about everything.

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.400
However,

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.320
I will only reveal it to you

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.690
once you're calm

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.480
and actually ready to listen.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.159
Are you ready, Alan?

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.360
I am ready.

00:08:14.970 --> 00:08:16.560
Then I'll take you somewhere.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.480
You want to know, do you?

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:17.720
The truth is in there.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.440
Greetings, Alan.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:58.280
Don't be afraid just yet.

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:01.040
If you're watching this video right now,

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.640
that means your
condition's been at its worst.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.040
But first, Allow me to introduce myself.

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.440
My name's Alan.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.480
Professer Alan Bunnalai.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.000
I'm a psychiatrist

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.040
and the founder of
this psychiatric hospital

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.960
"Familienhaus."

00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:20.720
And I

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.680
am you.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:30.440
What is this?

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.080
I know you might be shocked

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.120
and won't believe what
I'm going to say next,

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.520
But everything is true.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.040
We're the same person.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.280
We have Alzheimer's disease.

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.050
What you believe or peceive yourself as

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.250
as a young man

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.400
is actually

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.770
the result of you forgetting
your current identity.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.240
Eight straight lines.

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.040
Now, what do you see?

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:02.320
Ant.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:03.720
It can't be.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.760
What is this?

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:06.130
The disease that we're having

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.520
- What is this?
- causes our memories

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:09.920
to rewind back

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:11.480
to the times that we were happy

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.400
and tie us to them.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:18.280
How could you die?

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.000
You're in my memories,

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.080
and you'll be there forever.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.800
Believe me, it's true.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.000
In those days was the
time you met Darwin.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:34.800
The guy

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.680
who liked to climb windows
just to see you all the time.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:41.280
He was the one who made you fall in love.

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.920
Darwin was Win?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.240
You and Win

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.400
grew up in
the orphanage together.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.440
Both of you had been
best friends since childhood.

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:50.850
even during the academies,

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.280
you two had to study
at the same place.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.280
The two of you had been
there through thick and thin,

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.360
sharing experiences and memories

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.240
before your relationship
blossomed into love.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.080
Even this hospital

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:03.960
The two of you created it together

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:06.560
after the abbot had died.

00:12:07.630 --> 00:12:08.880
The two of you

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.050
felt that it was a shame

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.280
that this place
would be destroyed.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.560
Both of you were very happy,

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.500
spending your lives here
as if it were a second home.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.120
A home that housed more
than just the two of you,

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.640
but also held another
life that you had adopted.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.560
His name was

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.200
"Alex."

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.680
Alex?

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.080
You had been promoted to director

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.760
and Win was your soul mate,

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:37.680
with Alex

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:40.160
fulfilling joyfulness
for the family.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.960
Win meant
everything in your life.

00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:47.840
Never a day passed without
his presence by your side.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.080
Win...

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:51.960
He loved you from
the bottom of his heart.

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.040
You also felt the
same way about him.

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:56.960
But today,

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.680
I'll have to tell you the truth.

00:13:00.090 --> 00:13:02.120
Doctor Darwin Bunnalai

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:05.400
has passed away

00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.520
from leukemia.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.240
You promised

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.580
we wouldn't leave each other.

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:24.650
I gave you one minute,

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.440
but I haven't heard a
single apology from you.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.160
Hello, Mister Alan.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.570
Are you coming down to eat?

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.680
This way.

00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.040
Quick.

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.350
Win!

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.980
I've called, but
you didn't answer.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.120
Don't ever do this again.

00:13:39.270 --> 00:13:40.290
Not cool.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.760
You've promised, okay?

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.680
But his body

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:48.040
is still in the cemetery.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.800
Dad.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.760
Are you alright?

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.160
Win has passed away?

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.320
It...

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.420
It can't be.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:19.360
That's not true!

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.580
I don't believe it.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.080
I don't belive this!

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.570
I just seen him yesterday,

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:26.160
we were still together.

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:28.000
This is a big deal, Win.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.480
I don't know anything about myself.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:32.570
And I must learn the truth.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.720
How can you be so sure

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:35.760
that knowing it will
make your life better?

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:38.580
We'd been doing well together...

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.760
The lies from others
weren't that bad.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.480
But the lies you told

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.410
were the most agonizing!

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:57.600
Win...

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.350
who you have seen,

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:00.090
met,

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:00.730
This is...

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:02.080
or touched...

00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:04.660
Why...

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.200
Why wasn't Win

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.920
in the photo with me?

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:14.720
because your brain created him.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.040
You're still bound

00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:19.120
by the happiness
you had with him.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.440
You've been keeping
him existing to this day.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.600
However, if you
don't believe me...

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:28.320
Do you notice
the piece of mirror

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:31.040
beside the bookshelf?

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:33.720
Try to concentrate

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:35.600
and carefully gaze into it.

00:15:36.770 --> 00:15:39.200
You'll see the truth through that mirror.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.840
I'm intentionally
recording this video for you

00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:04.200
on the days I'm still healthy,

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.960
before my condition
deteriorates.

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:09.120
Finally,

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:10.720
I wish that you...

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:12.720
No, we...

00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:15.520
would get through this together,

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:18.080
like we always have everytime.

00:16:19.330 --> 00:16:20.400
If we're lucky,

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.280
I hope this will be the last time for us.

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:26.640
Please do remember, Alan.

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:28.760
Best of luck to you.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:16.210
Have I...

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.760
really gone old now?

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.380
Dad.

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.280
I'd like to be alone
for a moment.

00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:31.640
You must have known that knowing the truth

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.320
terrified me the most.

00:19:36.970 --> 00:19:39.200
So you didn't want me to
hurt more than I already did.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:41.760
I admit

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:44.280
I was scared
and frustrated

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.560
that I had to tell myself every day that...

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.240
from now on,

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.280
I would never have
you by my side again.

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:59.360
You know, Win?

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:03.120
Just the thought of
it was excruciating.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.240
But from this day, I won't
be scared of anything.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.640
Because I've gone through
everything I feared most.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.600
If you're with me

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.760
right here and right now,

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.360
I want you to

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:19.760
get over the fear
together with me.

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.200
I want you to no
longer worry about me.

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:28.000
Nothing can ever hurt me again.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:30.960
From now on,

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.480
I will live my life for you.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:38.920
I promise I'll come
visit you everyday...

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.520
so you won't ever
be lonely again.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:00.520
Have I been doing this many times?

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.360
Four times.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:08.080
I told you to do all of this?

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.760
You did.

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:14.240
You gave us the command

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:17.720
that every time you had to restart,

00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:19.920
if things had gotten too far,

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.920
we had to show you the video.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:26.720
You must have grown tired of me

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.000
over and over again, right.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.360
Dad.

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:36.280
Can you really remember me now?

00:21:43.890 --> 00:21:46.360
Everyone of us has been trying
our best to follow your directives

00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:49.120
and has always hoped

00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:51.760
that each time
would be the last.

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:57.240
Thank you, son.

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.680
Thank you so much.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.800
Sure, Dad.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.080
Alan.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:05.810
Time for your medication.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.240
How dare you

00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.960
call me by my name?

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.040
I'm your professor.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:25.840
Professor...

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:28.160
Professor, you...

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:30.400
you remember me now, right?

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:31.880
Of course,

00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:33.440
you were

00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:35.480
my troublesome
student, you know?

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.940
You're much more
troublesome than me.

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.280
Thank you very much, Doctor.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:47.040
Thank you everyone.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.240
I truly appreciate it.

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:54.080
But I still have
another question.

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.960
Does Nate actually exists?

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:00.400
Uh...

00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:03.320
Nate?

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:06.120
Who's that?

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.400
Does this mean that
I also created Nate?

00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:16.760
I believe so.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.440
He was probably the person
you created to be your friend,

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.640
similarly to children's
imaginary friends.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.160
I really was a trouble maker.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.140
You sure was!

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:39.120
Today must have
been tough for you, Nil?

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.880
I guess it wasn't just for me.

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:47.560
Yeah,

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:49.600
just like every other time.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:52.000
But I believed

00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:55.000
that we would get through it

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.280
You're always so positive, huh?

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.880
I'm just the way I am.

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.000
I don't see the
benefits of overthinking...

00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:10.240
doing so would age the face.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:13.680
Are you roasting me?

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.200
I know...

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.040
I know I've been

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.280
working so hard that
my face is all run-down.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.760
Right?

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.880
Yet your face seems
as young as ever.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.760
That's right.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.280
Because you

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:32.480
take everything too seriously.

00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:34.640
You should relax once in a while.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.080
It's impossible to for me

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.840
to be completely relaxed, Alex.

00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:46.780
You know what my
career's responsibilities were

00:24:46.810 --> 00:24:48.360
and what I had to do.

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.400
I'm well aware

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:52.160
and understand.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:56.760
But haven't things
been better than before?

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:15.240
Please don't put pressure on me.

00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.290
Nil.

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:28.600
Am I making you uncomfortable?

00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.370
I wouldn't say that.

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:35.000
Then what is it?

00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:38.400
What made you put up a wall
between us

00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:41.360
or was it just an excuse?

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:44.440
If you don't want to be with me,

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:46.240
you can be honest with me.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.780
I don't...

00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.440
I don't think I can give
you answers at this time.

00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:02.160
Listen to me, Nil.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.400
I'm mature enough to
understand everything.

00:26:06.410 --> 00:26:08.320
Just say the word that
you want me to wait

00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.280
and I'll always wait for you.

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:13.800
You know, I would
never ask you to do that.

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:20.000
Does this mean I have to
keep waiting for you to answer

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:23.200
without a destination like this?

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.560
You don't have to wait.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:47.710
If you meet someone new,

00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:50.240
have new ambitions, then I...

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.000
I want you to try opening
up to the opportunity.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:09.960
Given what you've said...

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.600
I really have to
let you go, huh?

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.880
Thank you, Nil.

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.080
Thanks for everything.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:52.480
But I wanted to let you know that

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.600
I will always be
waiting for you here.

00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.920
Someday, when you're ready

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.000
and open up your heart,

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:08.880
remember that I'll be here.

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.520
Thank you.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.720
What are you doing
standing here all by yourself?

00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:48.440
Something on your
mind about Alan?

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:52.840
Would you take me for a walk?

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.080
Go for a walk?

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:00.960
The sun's almost set.

00:29:03.850 --> 00:29:05.000
You're right.

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.680
How about this?

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.840
You're coming to stay
at my place to night.

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:11.480
Being alone

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:13.150
might get you lost
in your thoughts.

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:14.120
Also,

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.960
traveling back and forth to the
hospital is a waste of money.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.040
Another thing,

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:20.800
if you don't get enough sleep,

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.960
you'll slack off at work again.

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:25.640
Why'd you suddenly invite
me to stay at your place?

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:27.440
Are you planning something?

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.600
What plan?

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:32.600
Why?

00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:35.200
You can't have a sleepover?

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.160
I thought you said
we're boyfriends now.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:41.160
Wait...

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:43.080
When did I become your boyfriend?

00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:45.360
Let's see...

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.560
Oh!

00:29:49.140 --> 00:29:50.480
I remembered.

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:52.760
You're right,

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:54.760
Honey.

00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:01.160
- Here.
- Ouch!

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:03.330
That hurts.

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.360
What the hell?

00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.600
Hey.

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:12.440
Can I ask you something?

00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:14.280
Since when did you like me?

00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:20.720
Well...

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:24.320
I dunno.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.080
Starting from good feelings

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.400
that kept growing

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.360
till they became affection, I guess.

00:30:42.190 --> 00:30:42.980
So

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.800
Are your parents okay with you

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:45.700
dating me?

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.700
Don't worry about that.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.160
The most I need to do

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.960
is just let them know.

00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.360
Anyway,

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:52.920
my life is my own.

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:54.000
And...

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:55.560
what about at the hospital?

00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:57.400
When people look at us,

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:58.960
doesn't that bother you?

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.040
I believe

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:07.280
everyone needs to be able to
separate work and personal matters.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:09.360
Oh,

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.160
one more thing.

00:31:11.550 --> 00:31:13.920
You must not get in my hair

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.480
while I'm working.

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:17.600
Otherwise, I'll lose my focus.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.140
Okay.

00:31:19.170 --> 00:31:20.080
Then you

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:21.960
musn't get in my hair too.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.040
You always do that.

00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:26.760
Alright.

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:28.840
Then

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:30.600
I'm going back to my work.

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.360
Give me a call when
you get off work.

00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:34.760
Hey, Doc.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.920
Is this your number?

00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.000
Try calling it.

00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:44.880
If my phone rings,

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:46.130
that means the number's mine.

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:46.980
Alright.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.160
I'm calling, one sec.

00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:53.000
Hey.

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:54.640
It's actually this number!

00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.320
Don't forget to add my
number to your contacts.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:01.600
See you after work.

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.310
Okay.

00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:04.920
There!

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.280
Quit it!

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.200
All set.

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:52.880
Please come in.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.000
Okay.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.600
You can place your
bags next to the bed.

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.000
Shouldn't you go wash up first?

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:39.240
Don't you like it this way?

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:40.990
Kinda sexy, I think.

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:47.360
If someday I grow older

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:49.400
and have Alzheimer's,

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:51.720
will you still be there for me?

00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.600
Why asks this all of a sudden?

00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:08.480
Are you thinking about Alan?

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.360
Yeah.

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:14.320
It makes me wonder...

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:16.960
how could we wake up each day

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:19.239
and forget about our loved ones?

00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.159
You think we'll still be
together until we get old?

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:23.719
No idea.

00:34:25.179 --> 00:34:26.679
But it's possible,
don't you think?

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.760
Pete.

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:36.920
We'll sort it out later.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:39.920
But for now,

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:41.960
we love each other.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:47.520
The way you think
about what's to come

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:49.600
is a good thing,

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:53.360
but if it makes the
present moment unhappy,

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.280
I think it's better to just let go.

00:34:59.430 --> 00:35:00.560
Go take a shower.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.960
Let me take care of
my work real quick.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:08.240
Alright.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:42.960
Now go take a shower.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:46.360
After I've showered,

00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:47.840
promise that

00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.880
you'll reward me, okay?

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:53.650
Go.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.520
Fine.

00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.220
Here you go, Win.

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:16.640
Your favorite.

00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:18.320
So you don't ever have to

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:20.320
go out to get one again.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.200
I'm here to visit
you, as promised.

00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.840
Thank you

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:31.680
for carrying out the promise
throughout your whole life.

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.680
You've never abandoned me...

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:38.800
Follow me, quick.

00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:44.200
regardless of the
circumstances we're in.

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:46.920
I love you so much, Win.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.360
From now on,

00:36:50.620 --> 00:36:51.560
there won't ever be

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:53.720
a hospital for the
forgotten anymore.

00:36:59.390 --> 00:37:00.360
Win...

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:03.360
You'll live on in
my memory forever.

00:37:07.250 --> 00:37:08.560
You remember

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.560
when you told me

00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:14.920
you wanted to see me
live a happy life every day?

00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.560
I've been happy

00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.840
every day, just like
you wanted me to.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:32.640
You will be a part
of my life forever.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.480
Good evening, professor.

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.240
Would you like to take
sleeping pills for tonight?

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.320
No, thank you.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.720
Where'd you like to sleep tonight?

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:17.520
Room 203 or the one
on the upper floor?

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.920
I'd like to return to my room.

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:25.760
There's nothing to worry about.

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.480
I can take care of myself.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:31.640
I'm going to sit here for a while.

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.040
You can go about your business.

00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:37.640
Very well, sir.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.410
Hey!

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:52.520
Win!

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:55.280
Who else but Win!

00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:57.560
Is this really you?

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.410
How did you come back?

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:07.490
It's really you!

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.680
Yeah, it's me.

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.800
Touch me all you want.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.960
You miss me?

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.380
It's been a while.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:15.760
You need to answer me first.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.640
How did you come back?

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:21.920
I think there might be a reason.

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.650
Normally,

00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:27.880
when your memory came back,

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.800
I'd be disintergrated

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:33.040
like sugar cubes in coffee.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.360
Actually, I'd braced myself

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:42.160
that when you
remembered everything,

00:40:43.660 --> 00:40:45.520
you'd return to being the same Alan...

00:40:46.570 --> 00:40:47.840
and then I'd disappear again.

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.640
But I didn't vanish this time?

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.000
Who do you think happened?

00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:00.320
I'm not sure either.

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.440
Maybe my memory's gotten better.

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.400
Couldn't be.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.720
Your dementia

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.440
is incurable.

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:13.810
We can only delay the symptoms

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.040
so they don't get worse.

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.960
But I came back to you this time

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.800
because of a promise.

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:28.520
A promise?

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:32.400
Do you remember
what we've promised?

00:41:36.570 --> 00:41:37.760
I remembered now.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:40.760
You once promised you'd
come back to pick me up.

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:46.960
Sleepy...

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:49.640
I'm feeling kinda tired.

00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:50.800
You're tired?

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:52.040
But it's the middle of the day.

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:56.280
I'm in my old age now, Win.

00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.040
My body needs some rest.

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.400
You should head back first.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:01.480
I'm going to take a nap.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:02.980
What do you mean old?

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.360
Take a good look
at yourself again.

00:42:07.850 --> 00:42:09.680
If this isn't old, then
what do you call it?

00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:11.270
You don't believe me?

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:12.480
Come, quick.

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.200
Here,

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:24.400
Look again.

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:34.800
Hey!

00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:38.440
Is this real.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:41.040
Is this really happening?

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:44.550
Jerk.

00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:45.800
That hurts, Win.

00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:47.960
To ensure you that
you're not dreaming.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.000
Why am I becoming young again?

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:58.000
Because this is where
your journey starts.

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.800
Time to go back to your room.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:04.880
Alan.

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:10.320
Alan.

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:12.360
Alan.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:13.960
Alan!

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:22.800
A journey, right?

00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.120
Are you ready?

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.840
I'm good to go.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.200
Somebody

00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.360
help!

00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:57.200
Somebody help!

00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:58.800
Alan.

00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.520
Alan.

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.880
Alan

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:03.640
Please perform CPR on him.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.240
Hurry!

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:09.640
When did he fall down?

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:10.960
A few minutes ago, doctor.

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:30.040
I promise

00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:33.600
we'll always be together.

00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:38.120
Forever?

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.400
Forever.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:43.960
Forever.

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.680
Ready?

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.110
All set.

00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.320
Are you ready too?

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:56.720
I'm ready.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.000
Shall we go then?

00:45:02.090 --> 00:45:03.000
Let's go.

00:45:11.550 --> 00:45:12.480
Alan.

00:45:12.740 --> 00:45:13.920
Alan.

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:15.680
What happened?

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:19.270
He's not breathing.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.760
Pump faster.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:22.920
Alan.

00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.620
- Alan.
- Keep going.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:26.760
Alan.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:29.640
Alan.

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:32.440
Alan.

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.000
Pump faster.

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.880
Alan.

00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:40.120
Does he have a pulse.

00:45:40.590 --> 00:45:41.590
Alan.

00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:43.540
Alan.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:45.440
Come on, faster.

00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:47.600
Alan.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.160
Alan.

00:45:49.670 --> 00:45:50.560
Alan.

00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:26.120
The psychiatric hospital

00:46:26.570 --> 00:46:27.800
"Familienhaus."

00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.160
I'm glad I grew up here.

00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:32.870
I'm glad

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.720
that I met the love of my life.

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:37.320
I'm glad

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:38.760
I've lived

00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:40.800
and raised a family here.

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.440
And in the end...

00:46:44.350 --> 00:46:46.640
I'm glad I've spent my
final moment in this place

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.960
with a lifelong partner
in crime of mine.

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.680
Hey.

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:39.920
I love you.

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.360
I love you too.

00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:44.000
Forever?

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:46.960
Forever.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:52.560
Hey!
เฮ้ย

00:47:52.690 --> 00:47:54.640
Are you guys done saying you love each other?
พวกมึงรักกันพอรึยัง

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.440
I've been waiting for too long.

Okay.
