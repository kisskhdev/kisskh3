Young man.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.850
Did that old fool say when he'll be back?

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.780
Madam Liu,

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:30.410
whatever Master wanted to say

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.730
was written in the letter.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.250
Letter?

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:35.810
Where's the letter?

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.900
My wife and daughter, may this letter stand in for my presence

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:53.980
I'm entangled in pressing matters

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.660
and still can't return home anytime soon.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.460
The one delivering this letter

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.140
is my final disciple,

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.220
Han Li.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.370
He possesses unique skills

00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:05.660
and can be trusted.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.410
If anything happens at the Mo Residence,

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.730
feel free to let him handle it.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:14.410
If he can keep the Mo family safe,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.900
then he may choose

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.980
to marry one from Yuzhu, Fengwu,

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.490
or Caihuan.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.100
As for her dowry,

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:24.340
use the Sunwarm Jade.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.610
Why are they looking

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.460
so guarded?

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.250
It doesn't make sense.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.810
I've read this letter hundreds of times.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.340
There's nothing suspicious in it.

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.100
Master cares deeply

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:54.140
for the family.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:56.020
He wants me

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:57.100
to ease the burdens

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.410
on the Mo family.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.410
If you ladies have anything urgent

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:02.580
that needs dealing with,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.020
just let me know.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.050
I shall

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.290
give it my all.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.530
It's getting late today.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:13.340
Young Master Han, why don't you

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:14.890
stay here at the residence tonight?

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.180
As for everything else,

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.220
we can

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:20.610
talk about it tomorrow.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:22.300
We'll discuss it tomorrow.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.490
- But... - Yuzhu,

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.370
Fengwu, Caihuan,

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:27.010
quickly.

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.700
Show Young Master Han to the west wing to rest.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:30.890
Please.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:50.490
They're in such a rush to send me off.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:52.180
Something is up.

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.420
You all remember

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.530
what the Master told us before leaving.

00:10:59.390 --> 00:11:01.370
If valuables are sent here,

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.940
all is well.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.340
But if it's a letter,

00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:06.890
it's most likely

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:08.610
bad news.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:09.650
Madam Yan,

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:10.890
let's read the letter.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.060
Very well.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:13.130
The secret letter

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.420
will show its content.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.460
Secret letter?

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.890
That old fool

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.490
had a backup plan in place.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:20.820
I told you to stop fooling around.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.010
Our mothers seem to like him.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:25.770
Nanny Wu,

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.220
bring some water.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:30.980
Why water?

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:40.770
It's all silent now.

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:42.300
Li,

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:43.060
be honest.

00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:44.130
First impression of Yuzhu?

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:45.820
What do you mean?

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.100
My father told us

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.300
he'd betroth one of us

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:50.060
to his final disciple.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.060
You three are prestigious ladies.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:54.250
Master must have

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.300
been kidding.

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:56.420
I can't take it seriously.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.610
Ladies,

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:58.650
you need not worry.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.420
Madam Wang, activate your inner strength.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.940
Inner strength?

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:13.820
If you're reading this, it means I'm no longer

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:15.100
of this world.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.770
The one who took my life was...

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:19.340
Father would never

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.060
- make a joke... - Did they finish reading?

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:20.770
with our marriage.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:23.300
- Darn it. - My sister would like to speak with you.

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:24.370
- What's on the letter? - Young Master Han?

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.820
You came at the perfect time.

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.000
- She talks a lot. - If you can get rid

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:27.770
of that impostor Wu Jianming,

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:28.640
I can't hear a thing.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.650
I don't mind marrying you.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.820
It's him!

00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:33.770
He looked like an honest fellow.

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.370
Can't judge a book by its cover.

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:36.850
If he could fool the Master,

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:38.060
we must be cautious.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.700
What are they whispering?

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.820
This grudge

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.460
must be avenged.

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:44.580
Vengeance is needed.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.730
He must pay for this.

00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:46.490
What now?

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.340
We kill him.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.610
It's always the same methods.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:49.890
My venomous spider

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.980
was a gift from the Master before he left.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.340
After all these years,

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.530
it's time for it to get some fresh air.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.940
I have a recipe.

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.340
The Master says

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.220
to use it when necessary.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.530
Tonight,

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.370
I'll brew the drug.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.300
Madam Yan, brew the drug

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.820
for my Jade Hornet Sting.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.980
Before we act,

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.820
we can knock him out with incense.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.370
One more thing.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:11.940
Father said you could choose,

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.580
but you must marry me first.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.650
I am the oldest sister.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.530
I can't hear a thing.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:16.300
In this family,

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.490
- the old ones can't get married. - They talk too much.

00:13:17.490 --> 00:13:18.610
The young can't get married yet.

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:22.850
Miss Yuzhu, do you have

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:23.940
the Sunwarm Jade?

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.650
You need not worry.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:26.980
Since Mother said so,

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:28.700
the Madams will take care of it.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.490
No,

00:13:29.630 --> 00:13:30.300
I mean,

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.650
you'd better not be a greedy one.

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.300
You'd ignore a beauty like Yuzhu?

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.650
All you care about is the Sunwarm Jade.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.730
Forget it, Fengwu.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:36.730
Don't make things hard for him.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:37.340
Yuzhu!

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:38.420
Don't speak like you've married him.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:39.580
I wasn't!

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.610
The path ends here.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:45.890
Where am I staying?

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:48.340
We got carried away chatting.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.130
West wing.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:50.980
This way.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.730
When do we make our move?

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.100
Tonight.

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.370
No time like the present.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.180
Alright.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.530
Wait.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.300
Young Master Han.

00:14:04.630 --> 00:14:05.530
Please.

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.530
Thanks for walking me here.

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.980
Rest well.

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.100
I didn't say anything wrong just now, did I?

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.490
He won't be upset, right?

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.750
- Why are you still here? - I told you...

00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:20.640
to talk less.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:21.860
Alright. I'm going.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.160
- Go. - Go on.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:25.700
Did I say anything wrong just now?

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.410
Right?

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:28.290
What do you think about me and him?

00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:29.540
They are finally gone.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:35.980
Madam Yan always thinks things through.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.340
Strange.

00:14:40.870 --> 00:14:41.700
Why is it quiet again?

00:14:47.630 --> 00:14:49.370
- We'll go with your plan. - Whatever you say.

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:50.130
Alright.

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.180
Since everyone agrees,

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.700
we still have to treat him well.

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.890
Let him stay at the residence.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.460
Give him good food and drink.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.220
Let him build up his strength.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.820
That way,

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:03.730
he'll be

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:05.650
more useful to us later.

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:08.490
Nanny Wu.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.010
Make sure Young Master Han gets a hearty breakfast.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.060
Use the same standard

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:13.340
that we had for the Master.

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:20.180
Whatever they're planning,

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:22.460
I have to get the Sunwarm Jade

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:23.490
they promised me.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:45.850
I'm running out of pills.

00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:48.490
Better save them for a critical moment.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:25.370
Good morning, Young Master Han.

00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.980
Mother asked Nanny Wu

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.340
to prepare a hearty breakfast.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:29.490
Come eat with us.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.250
Young Master Han, have some.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.700
Everything was specially made

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.530
by Nanny Wu at our mothers' request.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.460
I called someone greedy last night,

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.180
but that was totally wrong.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.130
He's just stingy, that's what.

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.340
Who comes as a guest,

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.940
eats and drinks for free,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.250
and shows up empty-handed?

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:03.850
That's enough.

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.460
Can you stop going on and on?

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.770
Asking him for gifts the moment you open your mouth?

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.250
That's just as bad.

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.250
Didn't he ask us

00:17:10.270 --> 00:17:11.370
for the Sunwarm Jade?

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.850
Ladies,

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:18.580
this meal,

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.100
is too much for me.

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.340
But,

00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:22.760
I do have something

00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.340
that can serve as a gift.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.340
What's this?

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.300
This?

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.460
It's called Fragrance Pellet.

00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:35.650
Carry it with you.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.650
It helps keep mosquitoes and bugs away

00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:38.980
with a light floral scent.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.250
It smells so good.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.060
What if men start lining up to propose?

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.010
This is official imperial medicine.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.490
Such a rare and precious court medicine,

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.610
and you're giving it away?

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:54.060
Don't tell me you've fallen for the two of us.

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:55.370
Fengwu,

00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:56.770
don't talk nonsense.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.770
All of this

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.580
was made by Nanny Wu based on guesses.

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.100
We're not sure if it suits your taste, Young Master Han.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.580
Whichever one you like,

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:17.220
we'll have her make it again tomorrow.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.300
These two girls are noisy,

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:25.610
but they're easier to deal with than the mothers.

00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:28.250
Until I find the jade,

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:30.060
I'd better play along with them.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:35.850
Delicious.

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:36.890
Do you like it?

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.250
If you like it,

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.050
then I like it too.

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:48.700
My belly hurts.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.380
Mothers?

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.220
You,

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.940
come with us.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.490
We brought you here

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.330
because there's something we want to ask you in person.

00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.730
No need to ask.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.620
I killed Physician Mo.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.050
At least you're honest.

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:01.770
He tried to kill me first.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:02.860
All I did

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:03.940
was defend myself.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.250
We can look past

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.220
what you did to the Master.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:19.220
But you must agree to do something for us.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:22.980
Alright.

00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:25.900
But I want you

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.420
to swear on Physician Mo's spirit.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:30.140
Once it's done,

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:31.810
give me the Sunwarm Jade.

00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:35.090
Do you know who you're going after?

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:37.660
I must have

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.180
the Sunwarm Jade.

00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:52.050
His name is Ouyang Feitian.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:53.810
He has always committed evil acts.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.090
He slaughters the innocent.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.570
He has even spread the word

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.290
that he'd wipe out our family.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.570
Eliminating him

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:00.980
not only protects us,

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.420
but also benefits the people.

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:04.900
Fine.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:10.700
Don't say we didn't warn you.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:11.900
His martial skills

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.460
surpass the Master's.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:15.010
He treasures his life dearly.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.220
He's probably surrounded by layers of traps.

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.220
Underestimating him

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:19.460
will only get you killed.

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:21.180
Did you get all that?

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:23.770
No need for you ladies to worry about that.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.420
And your sincerity?

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:29.490
Alright.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.050
We can do that.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:32.010
We swear

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.220
on the spirit of our late husband, Mo Juren.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.330
If you can get rid of

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.420
Ouyang Feitian for us,

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.140
we'll give you the Sunwarm Jade.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:45.420
Deal.

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.290
Deal.

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:57.460
It's like he didn't hesitate at all.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:31.310
[Ouyang Feitian]

00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:33.330
Who might this mighty warrior be?

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.620
You're Ouyang Feitian?

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.250
This is a sacred place of serenity.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:49.700
Don't be reckless.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.010
You're reeking of murderous intent,

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:53.620
and you talk about serenity?

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.860
You're a cultivator?

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.700
A proper cultivator,

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.900
getting involved

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:11.330
in mortal disputes?

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.380
Who sent you?

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.570
Which family hired you?

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.700
I am

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:19.940
willing to pay double

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.290
if you

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.460
could spare me.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:26.700
Bargaining?

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.180
I've looked into you.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.900
You've committed

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.220
countless crimes.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.700
Now you think you can buy your life back?

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.810
Master,

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.860
why must you trouble a mere mortal like me?

00:23:41.310 --> 00:23:43.010
I've even sent men many times

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.140
to Tainan Valley to seek cultivators,

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.600
but

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.900
I never managed to find any trace.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.530
Now that I finally met one,

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:53.570
naturally,

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:55.220
I'd like to build

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.010
a good relationship with you.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.900
Tainan Valley?

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:04.140
Yes.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:06.570
Since ancient times,

00:24:07.550 --> 00:24:08.770
Tainan Valley

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:10.090
has been a gathering place

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:11.420
for immortals.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:14.900
Legend has it that a hundred years ago,

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:16.980
someone there

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:18.220
was chosen

00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:19.980
to become a disciple of an immortal.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.420
Please look, Master.

00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.250
This is

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.330
a map of Tainan Valley.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.900
If you wish to have it,

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:36.330
I will

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:38.530
gladly hand it over.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.050
Tainan Valley…

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.490
That sounds familiar.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.460
Could there be other cultivators?

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:49.250
Seems like you're not interested in that, Master.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:50.620
Well then,

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.730
forget it.

00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:23.420
Once this is all done,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.290
I'll go check out Tainan Valley.

00:25:45.550 --> 00:25:46.250
Mother.

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.180
Ouyang Feitian...

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.180
We have news.

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.330
What happened?

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.620
He's dead.

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.380
That fast?

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:56.460
Mother!

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:57.460
How is that possible?

00:25:59.030 --> 00:25:59.980
He is back.

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.290
So soon?

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:09.290
She is the only one who tends to the herbs.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.420
Looks like Physician Mo passed

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:13.090
all his knowledge to this mute girl.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:27.090
It's done.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.180
Now hand over

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.220
the Sunwarm Jade.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.860
This is indeed

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.180
the Ouyang family heirloom

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:37.090
from Lone Manor.

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:04.700
What's the meaning of this?

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:06.420
Trying to go back on your word?

00:27:06.790 --> 00:27:07.770
No.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.860
It's just

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.220
that it happened so suddenly,

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:10.940
we...

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:12.660
we weren't prepared at all.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:14.090
Prepared for what?

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:15.730
We had an agreement.

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.810
I help you,

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.810
you give me the jade.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.140
How long do you need?

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.180
Ten days.

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:24.050
Ten days?

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.050
We originally estimated

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.490
you and Ouyang Feitian would fight for ten days.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.250
Those ten days were critical for us to seize control

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.420
of the Lone Manor forces.

00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.250
Who knew you'd kill him in just two hours?

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.980
You completely disrupted our plan.

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.460
That was way too fast.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.770
You told me to kill Ouyang Feitian,

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.250
but you never said how long.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:44.730
Besides,

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:45.700
you swore to me.

00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:46.530
Right.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:48.220
We did make a vow.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:49.980
We promised if you took care

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.980
of Ouyang Feitian,

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.050
we'd give you the Sunwarm Jade.

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.010
But now what?

00:27:54.270 --> 00:27:55.700
You call that taking care of it?

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:56.420
Exactly.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.770
One old problem is gone,

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.250
and now a new one shows up.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.770
Now that Ouyang Feitian is dead,

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.250
not just the Jingjiao Sect,

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.700
but all of Jiayuan City will be in chaos.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.090
I even heard whispers

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.180
that the Five-Color Sect will make a move tonight.

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.330
- The Five-Color Sect? - Yes.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.830
Tonight?

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:10.320
Yes.

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.810
If they take over Lone Manor,

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:13.770
what about us?

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:15.390
Will we even survive?

00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:16.990
- What now? - What should we do?

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.860
Seems like

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:19.490
you didn't just kill the Master,

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.860
you're also about to bring ruin to the Mo family!

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:24.570
We're widows and orphans here.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:25.620
What are we supposed to do?

00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.480
- Yeah! - What now?

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.900
Tell us what we should do!

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.660
What should we do?

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.810
Sounds to me like you're backing out!

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:31.660
We're not backing out!

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:33.220
Then, how do I get the jade?

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:36.860
You...

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:38.810
stay.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.730
That's impossible.

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:45.730
Why not?

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:46.250
Yeah!

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:47.250
The Sunwarm Jade

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:48.940
is the Mo family's heirloom treasure.

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.570
And we've made a deal.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:51.530
Our family

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.620
has three daughters,

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:54.660
and they'll all marry you.

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.700
The Sunwarm Jade would be their dowry.

00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:58.770
- All yours. - No way!

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.220
- Everything yours. - I'm going to become an immortal!

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.250
Our daughters

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:02.770
are the pride of Jiayuan City.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.770
The Three Beauties of the Mo family!

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:05.310
Trust me,

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:07.330
people are lining up just to marry into this family.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.810
Exactly.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:09.050
You're scoring big here, you know?

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.490
You even get the Sunwarm Jade!

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:12.010
- Don't be ungrateful. - It's all yours!

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.120
- So lucky. - Seriously.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.050
- Don't run! - You hit the jackpot!

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:15.770
- Right? - Stop!

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:17.660
Are you all done?

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:18.490
Now hear me out.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.490
There's no way I'm staying.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:22.140
Come up with something else.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:26.900
There are still villains in the City.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.570
I wonder

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.980
where they hide the Sunwarm Jade.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.570
If the three of us will marry Li...

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:44.770
If I snatch it by force,

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:46.330
- they might destroy it. - Yeah.

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:47.330
That'd be trouble.

00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:48.570
You little rascal.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:49.620
Just say it.

00:29:49.790 --> 00:29:50.770
Do you agree or not?

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:53.090
If they're all bad guys,

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.940
then I'm just saving the people.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.010
But I can't let them keep dragging this out.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:13.420
[Mo Residence]

00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:34.180
[May I borrow the recipe for Fragrance Pellets?]

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:40.980
It's you.

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:58.770
Can you hear me?

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.730
This book contains essentials

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.290
of medicines written by your father.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.010
Aside from

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.250
the Fragrance Pellet formula,

00:31:09.790 --> 00:31:11.010
I've also added my own notes.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:12.420
I hope it'll help you.

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:27.460
[I'll return it after copying.]

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:29.420
No need.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.660
This belongs to the Mo family.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.140
I'm returning it

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.490
to its rightful owner.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.700
Of all in the Mo family,

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.730
only she seems decent.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.530
Quiet and well-behaved.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:54.730
Looks like she has

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.810
inherited Physician Mo's medical skills.

00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.860
Too bad she can't speak.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:16.980
Young Master Han.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:20.460
Young Master Han.

00:32:20.790 --> 00:32:21.900
Have some tea before you go.

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.900
Never mind.

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:49.980
That's a good idea.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.050
This man is nicknamed Black Bear.

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:54.980
The Five-Color Sect's

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.860
[Black Bear]
top contender for the next Sect Leader.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.090
He rose through the ranks by pillaging and killing.

00:32:59.310 --> 00:33:01.250
He even kills the elderly and children.

00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:02.530
Taking him out

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.220
means removing a threat to the Mo Family.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.660
It rids the people of a menace.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.050
Once it's done,

00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.530
I'll hand over the Sunwarm Jade

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:09.730
with both hands.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:12.140
We give you our word.

00:33:14.590 --> 00:33:15.570
So, you're Black Bear.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.860
Sounds like you really are rotten to the core.

00:33:20.270 --> 00:33:22.180
Who are you calling Black Bear?

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.460
He did it again.

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.290
He really killed Black Bear.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.330
So what do we do now?

00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:40.490
Are we seriously

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:41.940
going to let him marry all three

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:43.090
of our daughters?

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.700
And give him the Sunwarm Jade too?

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:46.570
No way.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:47.620
If he leaves,

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.490
we'll be four helpless widows.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:50.570
Besides,

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.050
we still have so many enemies.

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.810
That's

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:55.810
why we must do whatever it takes

00:33:56.030 --> 00:33:56.980
to make him stay.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.730
Why is it so quiet?

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:06.180
No one is here.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:09.530
Don't tell me they ran off

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.810
to avoid paying up.

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:20.140
Young Master Han,

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.490
we were just looking for you.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:22.420
Weren't you all out?

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.010
We've been waiting here for you.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:24.570
Come.

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.460
What for?

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:26.180
Measurements for new clothes!

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:27.980
- Haven't had time to wash your old ones. - What?

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.010
You've killed two villains.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.490
What?

00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.900
We'll wash them for you.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.620
No, no need!

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.850
Ladies, you don't have to.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.900
From now on,

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.380
we'll take care of all your laundry.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:36.050
No need!

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:37.220
You've killed two,

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.050
your clothes must be filthy!

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.220
I'm great at sewing.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.250
From now on,

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.220
I'll make all your clothes.

00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:42.810
Never mind.

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:44.220
Just help us out this once.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:46.660
Don't tell me you want me to get revenge again?

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.570
That's right.

00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.730
Guihua Alley.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:49.660
Old Master Wu.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:51.860
I'm not going.

00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:53.660
Han Li!

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:40.830
No.

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:42.780
I can't delay any longer.

00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:48.860
Here.

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:49.950
Have a bowl of herbal tea.

00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:50.780
It'll cool you down.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:35:58.950
Sir!

00:35:58.970 --> 00:36:00.380
You're finally back!

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:01.950
Jiayuan City has been in chaos lately.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:03.260
Ouyang Feitian, Black Bear,

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.180
and even the Mo Family's future son-in-law are dead.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:05.820
Where's my friend?

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:07.380
Don't even ask about him.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:08.510
He is lovesick.

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:10.030
He has been moping day and night.

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:10.660
He does nothing

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:11.380
but stand there.

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:12.910
He's ruining my business.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:17.700
Qu Hun.

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:25.860
Let's go.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.590
There's no time.

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:37.150
If they try to stop us again,

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.470
I won't hold back.

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.590
Why did you bring someone along?

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.380
He's backup.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:58.340
Look,

00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:00.070
aren't you misunderstanding us?

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.430
What?

00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:02.660
You really think

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.150
we'd try to cheat you?

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:05.910
You know best.

00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:08.430
I did everything Physician Mo

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:09.950
asked in the letter.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.220
As promised,

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:13.180
hand over the Sunwarm Jade now.

00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.110
Don't worry.

00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:15.990
You all,

00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:16.950
hurry

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.150
and bring the jade here.

00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:28.590
Young Master Han,

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:30.590
word has been going around

00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:31.950
that the Mo family

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:34.470
has gained a son-in-law with thunderous means.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:35.180
Really,

00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:37.060
we couldn't be happier.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.820
At last, we have someone to rely on.

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:39.550
Look...

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:40.660
Spare me the excuses.

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.780
Look.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:47.030
Turn around and take a look.

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:48.910
The dowries

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.260
are all here.

00:37:56.610 --> 00:37:57.510
The first chest

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.510
is filled with priceless gold and jewels.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:01.950
In the future,

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.740
the earnings from all our secret ventures

00:38:04.170 --> 00:38:05.990
will be yours to manage entirely.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:07.820
The second chest

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:10.220
holds our Mo family's ancestral medical compendium

00:38:10.450 --> 00:38:11.860
and the keys to the clinic storeroom.

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:14.340
The third chest

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:17.380
contains all the weapon manuals from the Jingjiao Sect,

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:20.380
along with the Sect Master Token to rally the masses.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:26.150
You're trying to use these

00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:27.660
to keep me here?

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:29.470
And also

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.110
our three daughters.

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:34.300
And also

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:37.380
the four of us.

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:38.700
We all want to leave too.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.910
Don't forget me.

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:41.980
We all want to go with you,

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:43.510
together.

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:45.510
Take us with you.

00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:46.740
Let's run away together.

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:48.340
Who said I'm taking you along?

00:38:49.090 --> 00:38:50.150
Let me be clear.

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:51.300
None of those three

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:52.700
will ever be my wife.

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:53.950
The four of you

00:38:54.170 --> 00:38:55.340
are not coming with me!

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.030
Young Master,

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:58.380
take me with you.

00:38:58.680 --> 00:38:59.380
Go back.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.590
All I want is the Sunwarm Jade!

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:02.260
Why...

00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:04.220
Why don't you want me?

00:39:04.450 --> 00:39:06.180
Are the Three Beauties not good enough for you?

00:39:06.450 --> 00:39:08.150
Where did you get the confidence?

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.470
I'm one of the four Han heirs!

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.780
If I say no, it's no.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:12.070
Don't even try to persuade me!

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:20.220
What are we supposed to do without a man in the house?

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.990
I know what the ladies

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:23.950
are really up to with all this crying.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.340
- Stop crying. - With Father gone,

00:39:25.530 --> 00:39:27.910
those eying the Mo family fortune will surely strike.

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.430
- Stop crying. - The ladies just want

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:30.780
to keep this cultivator here...

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.910
- Stop crying! - to protect us.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:34.220
As for marrying us off and giving him the Sunwarm Jade,

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.910
they never meant to follow through.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.430
I just hope Li doesn't fall for it.

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.700
Keep this up

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:48.630
and I'll burn this place to the ground.

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.150
So there's really no room to talk?

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:01.300
None at all.

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.860
The Sunwarm Jade.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:10.860
Hand it over now.

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:13.470
No more talking.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.740
Attack!

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.030
You've been poisoned by Silver Demon Palm.

00:40:25.170 --> 00:40:26.630
You don't have long left.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.300
Once that poison sets in,

00:40:28.490 --> 00:40:29.630
not only can you not cultivate,

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.950
you won't live much longer.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:31.820
If I die,

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:32.820
you're coming with me!

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:33.910
Stay here,

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:34.990
and no one has to die.

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:36.110
The Sunwarm Jade, now!

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:37.380
Are you handing it over or not?

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:38.660
No!

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.820
We're dead either way.

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:41.340
If you've got the guts, kill me.

00:40:41.530 --> 00:40:42.430
Kill us all.

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:43.660
- Kill us! - Go ahead!

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:44.910
Kill every one of us!

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:45.740
Kill us!

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:46.780
Do it!

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:49.910
Kill us!

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:50.510
Kill us!

00:40:50.570 --> 00:40:51.180
Go on!

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:51.700
Kill us!

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.510
Kill!

00:40:52.530 --> 00:40:53.180
The poison's taking effect.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:55.260
You can talk?

00:40:55.530 --> 00:40:56.470
Kill us!

00:40:57.610 --> 00:40:58.150
Hurry!

00:40:58.760 --> 00:40:59.340
Quick!

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.220
Hurry!

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.030
Sleeping drug?

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:02.260
