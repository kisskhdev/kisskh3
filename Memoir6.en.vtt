WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.840
{\an8}If you want me to teach you French, you
must teach me muay, Monsieur Mek.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.040
{\an8}I will make sure my lessons
match your kindness.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.000
{\an8}PREVIOUSLY

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.080
{\an8}Let me show you how the French do it.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.320
{\an8}Rati!

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.200
{\an8}I suddenly felt like I was burning inside
despite being in the water.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.040
{\an8}He is engaged.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.920
{\an8}Would you still say that
you were not disgusted by me?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.400
{\an8}Is that you, my lord?

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.760
THEE

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.000
Smells lovely.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.280
Do you like it?

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.760
I must be dreaming.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.000
It's nice.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.480
Is it?

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.840
I'll stop by every morning.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.120
Would you like that?

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.480
Thee?

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.760
I brought you this bunga rumpai.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.120
The scent of rose petals and cloves
helps you feel relaxed.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.120
Put it next to your pillow

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.000
to remind you of the person
who gave it to you.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.800
Thank you.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.160
How did you get into my room?

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.600
It's time to get up.
You have a lesson to teach today.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.200
Or would you like me to…?

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.640
I'm up!

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.000
Coffee, sir.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.160
Thanks, Jam.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.280
Of course.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.840
Thee.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.240
Don't look at me like that.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.960
Like what?

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.440
Like…

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.800
Like you're really happy.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:17.519
- Unlike the way you look at me, my lord.
- Jam. Don't you have work to do?

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.200
I do. But I want to be here.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.200
Get to work.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.320
Yes, sir.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.360
- Jam.
- Yes?

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.520
Work.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.280
Yes.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.760
I'll leave your food here.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.840
I didn't mean to make you feel
uncomfortable by staring,

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:50.680
but I couldn't help myself.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.000
You have to.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.280
How could I when we…?

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.520
Thee!

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.760
You are so unbending.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.960
Each day, they seem
more and more than just friends.

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.960
Soon enough, people will talk.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.920
Those two?

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.080
Surely you're overthinking it.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.440
It's you who needs to think a little!

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.120
Don't you see the way
the count looks at Mr. Rati like…?

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.480
Stop it! You're giving me goosebumps.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.760
As I was saying, it's not typical!

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.080
The count is indeed very good to us,
but Mr. Rati is our master.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.880
I love my master.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.840
What should I do, Kui?

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.840
You can do whatever you want.

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.520
Just not what you just did to me.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.560
I was just demonstrating.
I would never smile at you like that.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.200
Get back to work!

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.840
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.000
Bonjour. Mon nom est Theerathon.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.360
Enchanté. Comment allez-vous?

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.200
Bonjour. Je vais bien, et vous?

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.840
Je vais bien. Merci.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:24.200
Very good.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.760
How do you pronounce this word,
and what does it mean?

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.200
Does anyone know?

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:38.880
Maison.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.120
It means "house."

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.440
Very good.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.200
Thank you.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.760
Good luck on your examination.

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:06.240
You can now begin.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.200
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.800
TEST

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:27.720
Goodbye.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.840
Thank you, Professor.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.480
No need to hurry. There's still time, sir.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.720
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.360
Professor!

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:40.280
If I wanted to, how would I say,
"Where would you like to go?"

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.919
Où veux-tu aller?

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.680
"Où veux-tu aller?"

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.760
Correct.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.360
Où veux-tu aller?

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.720
Où veux-tu aller?

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.800
"Where would you like to go?"

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:05.440
Là.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.120
Où veux-tu aller?

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.000
Je veux aller là-bas.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.240
Excellent.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.920
I'll be able to speak
to French passengers now.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.440
Thank you, sir.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.720
What's the matter, sir?

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.280
Did I say something wrong?

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.560
You speak as if we are not friends.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.320
You don't think I'm your friend?

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.440
We're at school.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.040
I think it will be improper
if anyone hears us.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.360
Mek.

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.040
Dech.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.080
Now that's more like it, Mek.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.360
Dech.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.560
If anyone actually heard us,

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.800
how would you even explain to them?

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.200
Try me.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.640
Who the hell do you think you are?

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.080
How dare you speak so casually
with my son?

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.760
Didn't you hear me?

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:18.840
- Mek is my--
- Nothing but a simple commoner, sir.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.280
I don't dare imagine myself
on par with the baronet.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.560
The baronet was so courteous to me,
speaking with such civility.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.760
I was only telling him to speak casually
to make it appropriate, my lord.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.960
He's right.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.360
You misheard, Father.
I was talking just now.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.320
Is that so?

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:41.400
Yes.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.840
A servant who knows his place
is a servant I like.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.680
If you ever need work,

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.640
come to my place.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:56.600
Let's go.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.880
I think they've all gone to bed, my lord.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.320
Should I try calling them?

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.680
No need.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.200
That's all I came for.
We're going home.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.280
Yes, sir.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.480
Did you come all the way here
just to take a look at his rooftop?

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.560
- Is there a problem?
- Of course not, sir.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.160
We can stay all night if you want.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.680
Let's go, then.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.720
Please, sir.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.720
Thee.

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.200
Are you going to leave
without even saying hello?

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:18.160
You should have gone straight home
after getting off work so late.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.000
I wanted to come here.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:20.960
But?

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.760
I'd have been satisfied
just seeing your bedroom window.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.360
That's my kind of rest.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.720
Thee.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.200
It's late.

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:39.240
It would be inappropriate
if anyone saw us.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.120
We're not doing anything inappropriate,
are we?

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.480
Would you prefer it if we were?

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.120
Thee.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:56.760
You were waiting for me, weren't you?

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.400
Otherwise, you would have gone to bed.

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.440
No, I wasn't.

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:02.720
You really are unbending.

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.240
The Floating Lantern Festival
is approaching.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.440
This coming full moon,

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.960
will you go to
the Floating Lantern Festival with me?

00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.880
What is a floating lantern?

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.840
I won't tell you just yet.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:31.080
I'll tell you that the event is
fun and lively, though.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.280
It is?

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.760
Give me an answer first.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.200
You promise to take me with you?

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.760
Aren't you always enthusiastic
when it comes to having fun?

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.800
Go to bed.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.200
It's late.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.280
You too.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.600
Goodnight.

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.480
Go home.

00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:58.960
Go to bed.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.040
The Floating Lantern Festival
takes place during the 12th month

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.320
when the moon is at its fullest
and brightest

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.880
and the tides touch the shores.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.680
We make krathong to float them
in the river, don't we?

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.320
Yes.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.160
You're very good at
cleaning banana leaves.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.560
You praise me too much, Thee.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:39.680
It's not an impossible task, you know.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.000
I can't even praise you now?

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.280
I wonder whose car that is.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.640
Mr. Rati.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.880
Mr. Rati, sir.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.280
You have a visitor, sir.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.920
Who is it, Kui?

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.360
Hello, Rati.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.400
Florion!

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.920
How did you get here?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.640
By boat. I bring news from
the French embassy and from your father.

00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.040
I still have trouble getting used to
the boat trip to Siam.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.920
I always end up
throwing up from seasickness.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:07.599
Mhay. Is your master all right?

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.920
It's the hot weather getting to him.

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.319
- Don't worry about him.
- Sounds like they're having fun.

00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.160
I have news from your father, Lutine.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.359
He asked me to bring you news from France.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.359
This is your father's message.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.360
What are they talking about?

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.520
It's only been a while
since they last met.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.480
Hardly long enough
to have missed each other.

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.920
He even brought a letter?

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.120
What's gotten into your master?

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.480
Look. He's talking to himself,

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:51.400
and he's tearing
those banana leaves to shreds.

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.960
Whose master do you think is to blame?

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.800
Do you know something I also suspect?

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.320
I don't.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.680
I don't know how many lanterns
we will make with this.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.480
- What are you all talking about?
- Oh, it's…

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.200
- This is difficult to cut, sir.
- It is, my lord.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.520
We're helping each other out.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.720
This letter contains
your return date to France.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:47.920
Good luck.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.440
Good luck to you too.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.600
Wow.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:13.800
It's beautiful.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.040
You cannot go to the festival
with anyone but me tonight.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.040
As your guardian by duty,

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.760
it is my sole responsibility
to take you to the festival.

00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.480
You are abusing your power.

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.400
But I accept.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.760
I knew you'd be here.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.760
I was going to give you
this book yesterday,

00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.440
but Father got in the way.

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:07.280
Why didn't you tell my father yesterday
that we are friends?

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.360
If I did, would your father
have accepted it?

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.400
You would at least be telling the truth.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.080
I didn't want to cause you any trouble.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.160
Were you afraid my father
would have you whipped?

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.000
I'm not afraid of getting hurt.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:34.720
I appreciate the fact that
you want to tell him we are friends.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.880
Your feelings… aren't hurt?

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.680
Are you worried about me?

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:43.840
Hey, I'm being genuine.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.680
We are friends,

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.600
and I want to be a good one.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:56.280
Thanks, Dech.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.120
I heard the Floating Lantern Festival
tonight is going to be grand.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.240
I take it you'll be in the ring fighting
to win some money?

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.480
I don't know.

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:10.320
I do want to float a lantern
like everyone else though.

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:12.720
Can you come?

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:23.600
My father insisted I must bring some lady
whose name I don't even remember

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.560
to the festival tonight.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.800
He forbids me to say no.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.440
That's good.

00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.480
A festival is the perfect opportunity
to go with a lover.

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.600
But I want to go with you.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.000
I never listen to anyone anyway.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.600
I'd rather go and have fun with a friend.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.880
But…

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.400
See you.

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:29.640
Mr. Rati.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.640
I'm here to pick up my guardian.

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.600
I feel like a student
just finishing school.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.040
I was afraid my guardian might think twice
about taking me to the festival.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.840
Thee.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.120
Hello.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.120
This is Mom Rajawong Tikumporn Borrirak,
the daughter of Duke Udomsawaddamrong,

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.800
the Minister of Education
at the ministry where I work.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.560
Your grandmother asked me
to accompany you back home for dinner

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.360
before we go to the festival together.

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.680
Shall we?

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.640
I'm afraid not.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.600
I am…

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:43.480
Mr. Rati.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.760
You have to go with the ministry's guest?

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.120
It is entirely all right.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.560
I will go with Jam and Kui.
You should go, sir.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.200
Mr. Rati.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.440
I will go with you tonight, as promised.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.160
You don't have to.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.040
Wait for me.

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.720
I will have Mhay tell you where to meet.

00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.240
At seven o'clock,
I will hurry and join you there.

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.920
You said your daughter
speaks English well.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:42.160
Beautiful and talented, you'd be an asset
to the work that Thee does.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.520
Don't you think, Thee?

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.600
I would never dare burden Lady Pa
with my work like that.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.160
"Lady Pa," Thee?

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.480
Don't be so distant.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.040
The Wisut and Borrirak families
are long-time friends.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.640
You can speak casually with her.

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:10.440
I hope there is no problem
with the betrothal we have spoken of.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:15.480
I am, for one, in total support
if my daughter has feelings for Mr. Thee.

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:18.840
Well, you troublesome grandson?

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.320
I already have gifts prepared

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.360
to welcome my future granddaughter-in-law
into the Wisut family.

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:40.680
- Mine is so much prettier than yours.
- Only because you're better at making it.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.920
- Of course I am.
- Hello, Jam.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.080
Hello.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.040
Hey. Look at that.

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.360
Appetizing!

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.480
My mouth is watering.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.680
Mine too! Oh!

00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:51.720
Look! Grilled chicken.

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.840
It's hot off the grill.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.120
- Feel free to stop by.
- Kui. Jam.

00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:58.880
It's almost nine o'clock.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.360
Let's go and wait for Thee
at the gazebo by the river.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.840
I don't want him to wait.

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:04.000
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.560
- I'll come back for the chicken.
- And I'll come back for the cotton candy.

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:09.640
I don't care.

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.080
Just make sure you share it with me.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:14.200
Corn! Fresh corn!

00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.120
Dech.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.000
Dech, I want this.

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.120
Fresh corn!

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:23.320
Is that all right?

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:24.960
Of course.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:27.160
I want two of these.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.240
And two of these, please.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.160
Oh, grilled chicken!

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.960
Dech, look how good this is.

00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:37.800
Is it all right if I buy this?

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.080
Of course.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.760
It is always better
to eat them cooked rather than raw.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.000
Thank you, Dech.

00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:48.680
Hey, make it well done, like he said.

00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.440
I want two of these.
And two of these.

00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.920
- Take care of her.
- Yes, sir.

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.880
It smells divine!

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.800
Give me this one too.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.200
And also this one.

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.160
Hold on, Dech--

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.400
- Where has he gone?
- I don't know, ma'am.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:06.800
Hey!

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.120
- Hey!
- Sweet treats!

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.360
Hey!

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.240
Hey!

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.600
We have all kinds of sweet treats.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.760
- Hey!
- Treats!

00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:19.400
Sweet treats!

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.320
Hey! Hey!

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.040
I want that. Oh!

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.640
You want some sweet treats?
Of course, dear.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.720
Thank you.

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.480
No…

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:36.040
My krathong!

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.560
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.320
You should have held it more firmly.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.480
You couldn't even
take care of a simple krathong.

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:43.840
How can you take care of me?

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:45.640
My dear.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.120
My dear, wait for me!

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.960
You!

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.800
Mek.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.880
Run, sir.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.600
You all right?

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:27.840
I will have my son, Ram, look up
the perfect date for the engagement.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.840
Yes, ma'am.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.920
Do it as soon as next week.

00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:33.040
Yes.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.960
Marriage is not on my mind right now.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.320
All I want to focus on
is serving my country.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:43.360
You can still do that as a married man.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.400
Am I right, Ram?

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.520
Yes, Mother.

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.880
Lady Pa is still young.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.920
She is perfect in every way.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.040
I'd hate to see her suffer
when I don't have time to care for her.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:59.080
If I were to agree
to this auspicious occasion,

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.680
I'm afraid it would do the lady
more harm than good.

00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.720
What a trivial concern.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.880
I think it would be better to do it soon
so people don't talk badly about you both.

00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.880
Lady Pa is ready for marriage.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.280
Am I right, dear?

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:14.560
But I am not.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.280
If you're preoccupied
with the matter with Monsieur Rati,

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:27.200
I can transfer this duty to someone else.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.440
Taking care of Professor Rati
is my responsibility.

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.520
You promised Monsieur Lutine,
the ambassador.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.560
That was mainly why he let his only son
stay behind for this job.

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.320
To transfer this duty to someone else

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.680
would be disrespectful to the ambassador.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:40.120
I feel it would be inappropriate.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.200
He's just a professor.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:45.600
Professor Rati is staying for only a year.

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.760
I don't think anyone would object

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.800
if this marriage were delayed
for some months.

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.720
Come here.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:10.920
Here.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.280
Careful.

00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.280
How did you get yourself in trouble
while taking a stroll with a lady?

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.680
I didn't mean to get into it.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:25.000
I was going to pay him for it.
You got in the way.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.760
Are you blaming me?

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.440
I literally just saved you.

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.800
You were too hasty.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.240
Yes. I was indeed hasty.

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:36.480
But I was only hasty
because I was worried about you.

00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.640
Hey!

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.520
Let's go.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.320
We lost them.

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.280
Come on.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:21.200
I'm glad you're talking to me
like an actual friend.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.120
You should go back to your lady.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.600
She must be waiting for you.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.920
I told you.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.000
I wanted to come here with you.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:32.160
I don't want to stand by while she shops.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.280
It's not fun.

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.440
I'd rather be getting chased with you.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.320
I feel sorry for the lady now.

00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.000
Don't you feel sorry for me?

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.680
I didn't want to come here with her.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.240
My father made me.

00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:55.840
He makes me do everything.

00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.200
He wants me to work at
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.000
But since I'm not bright,
he makes me study languages

00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.400
and introduces me to his powerful friends,

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:14.600
hoping to secure me a shortcut.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.560
But it's obvious
his friends' promises are empty.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.040
No one wants to hire a slowpoke.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.760
That's why I secretly practice muay.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.640
At least it's what I choose for myself.

00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.560
Muay is fun.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.320
It makes me feel like myself.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.600
I like doing muay.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:56.680
I've never told anyone any of that

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.760
except you.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.160
I was deadly sick as a kid.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.520
My mother worked hard to get me better.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.920
She mortgaged the land
that gave our family our livelihood,

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.760
but we got cheated.

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.600
The interest was more than
my mother could pay.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:27.400
And so she…

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.720
She died of heartbreak.

00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:34.320
That's when I started fighting.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.040
I'm doing everything I can
to buy the land back.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.760
I've also never told anyone that.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:59.520
This is what it is to be friends.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.480
Dech, my friend.

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:11.560
Let's go.

00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.920
I have to get in the ring
before everyone else takes my money.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.040
I'll come with you.

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.520
You'll have to catch up to me, then.

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.400
Mek!

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.199
- Ouch!
- What?

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:35.280
Kui, did you kick me?

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.480
What?

00:34:37.199 --> 00:34:38.360
You fell down.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.520
I was just nodding off.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.000
Mr. Rati, sir.

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:54.600
The festival is going to end soon.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:56.800
I believe it's nearly 11 o'clock.

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.120
Shall we float the lanterns together?

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:00.520
She's right, sir.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.440
I don't think he's coming.
It's more likely he went with his fiancée.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.520
- Kui!
- Ow!

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.600
What do you think you're saying?

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.000
Hmph!

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.760
Thee promised.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.960
He is coming.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.960
Jam. Kui. You two should go ahead
and float your lanterns.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.680
- Let's go.
- Are you out of your mind?

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.160
Let's go.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.040
It's late, sir.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.680
I don't want the deities going to bed
before we pay our respects.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.760
Hurry up.

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.360
Thee made this krathong from scratch.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.720
How could he not come?

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.560
Right?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.520
Would you like some krathong?

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.160
We also have water lilies.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.640
Hello there.

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:32.160
Come on here for sweet treats.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.560
- Let's float some lanterns.
- One baht each.

00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.000
Krathong over here.

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.840
Buy your krathong here.

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.240
I'm aware talking about marriage
makes you uncomfortable,

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.640
but how can we disobey our parents?

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.080
Sooner or later, it ought to happen.

00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.840
This marriage is still a long way off.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.600
I see no need to pay heed to it yet.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:07.000
And you don't have to do that for me.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:14.800
Take this krathong
and float it as you should.

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:25.120
You're not floating it with me?

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.760
I'll wait right here.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:37.760
My father and your grandmother meant
for us to float this krathong together.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.640
Do you plan to float another krathong
with someone else?

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:50.920
What would people say
if they saw me float it by myself?

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.680
I will wait here.

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:56.680
All right.

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.320
If this is your refusal of me,

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:05.280
I hope you are prepared
for the consequences.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:12.560
I am ready to face the consequences
of the choices I made today.

00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.600
Please go.

00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:25.000
That person must be waiting.

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.720
I will close my eyes and count to three.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:31.720
When you are out of my sight, I'll take it
that we lost each other in the crowd.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.760
Please float your lantern.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:38.600
I'll wait here and walk you back
to the car before I go.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.320
I want you to hurry up and leave.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:49.640
Don't stand here and make my humiliation
of floating a lantern alone any worse.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.440
One.

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.040
Two.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:03.680
Three.

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.120
Rati.

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:00.920
Thee.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.560
I'm sorry.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:34.760
Were you waiting long?

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.960
It's all right.

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:38.480
Let's go.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.680
I want to try lighting fireworks.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.320
This is the last one.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.120
Would you like to share
some snacks with me afterwards?

00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:20.640
We haven't floated our lantern.

00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.440
We can do that later.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.880
Is there something on your mind?

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.120
Will you talk to me?

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.440
Is it something you can't tell me?

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:25.360
You really didn't float a lantern
with anyone else?

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.120
I didn't.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.560
What about that lady?

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.320
I don't want anything to do with Lady Pa,

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:35.320
or any other ladies, for that matter.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:41.120
The only person
I want to do anything with is you, Rati.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:48.320
But…

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.400
What still bothers you? Just let me know.

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:59.520
You deserve to be happy
with the right woman.

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.000
One with whom you can have
a traditional marriage.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:06.360
If "happy" is what you want me to be,

00:43:07.480 --> 00:43:09.280
then I'm happy right now.

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.280
What else is on your mind?

00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.920
Florion visited this morning

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.800
to tell me when I'm going back to Paris.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.760
I know.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:32.320
I knew from the beginning that
you would go back to France one day.

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:36.240
But you're still the only person
I want to float this lantern with, Rati.

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.200
Do you want to do that with me?

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:49.120
And your heart…

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.080
How does it truly feel?

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:02.160
Forget all rationality,
and leave just your heart.

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:08.280
Answer my question only with your heart.

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:12.200
Do you have feelings for me…

00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.120
the way I have feelings for you?

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:49.160
I solemnly swear to the Goddess Ganga
and all the deities here tonight

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:52.280
that my body and my soul

00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:55.920
long only for Rati.

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:22.560
I solemnly swear to the Goddess Ganga

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.720
and all the deities here tonight

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.520
that, from now on, my body and my soul

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.600
will long for Thee,

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.000
and only for Thee.

00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:34.480
{\an8}"Viscount Rati Jarupich"?

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:37.560
{\an8}Your title has been officially published
in the Royal Gazette.

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:38.560
{\an8}NEXT EPISODE

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:42.120
{\an8}From now on, I believe things
will only continue looking up for us.

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.240
{\an8}- Are you going to deliberately lose?
- I…

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.240
{\an8}- Mek!
- Hey! Stop it!

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:52.680
{\an8}I need to talk to you about the wedding
between you and Lady Pa.
