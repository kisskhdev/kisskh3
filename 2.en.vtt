WEBVTT

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:19.760
Close the door for me.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.600
Okay.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:24.960
I told you to go out.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.760
Close the door.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.440
I didn't mean for you to lock yourself inside.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:30.920
Then could you be a bit clearer next time?

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:32.799
Come on, isn't that obvious?

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:33.960
Hurry up and get out.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.759
Qingyan.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.159
Qingyan, are you home?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.520
Wait.

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:41.039
Qingyan.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.200
First you tell me to go out,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.159
then you tell me not to.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.359
So am I supposed to go out or not?

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.240
Shh.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.439
Qingyan.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.479
Qingyan, are you inside?

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.759
Qingyan.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.679
Oh.

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:56.240
Right.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.240
I'm taking a shower.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.240
I'll be out soon.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:01.359
Aren't I supposed to go out?

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.039
Shut up, don't say anything.

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:09.319
Qingyan

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:10.079
What was that noise?

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:10.599
Are you okay?

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:12.359
I'm fine.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:13.799
Go, go, go.

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.319
Hide over there.

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.920
Hurry, hurry up!

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:15.519
Wait, this...

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.840
Don't come out.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.560
An'an

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.200
Why are you here?

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.959
I missed you.

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:28.400
I'm sleeping with you tonight.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.840
But what are you doing in there?

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:32.280
There was a strange noise inside.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.879
No, no.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.239
I'm taking a shower.

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:37.560
There's nothing in there.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:38.799
Then are you done showering?

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.760
Yes, I'm done, I'm done.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.359
Great, then I'll go in and use the bathroom.

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:43.239
No, no, no!

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.239
Um...

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.879
There's a lot of water on the floor inside.

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:47.560
Why don't you use the one upstairs?

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:49.359
It's the same wherever I go.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:50.439
I really can't hold it anymore.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.480
Hey, um...

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.319
Let me go in, please.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:53.159
You really can't use the bathroom in there.

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:07.719
Ah!

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:08.560
There's a pervert!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.800
Ah!

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.960
Qingyan!

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.120
Qingyan, call the police!

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.039
Th-there's a peeping pervert in here!

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.680
Miss,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.639
you were the one who started undressing in my house.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.000
You can't turn the tables on me.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.400
Your house?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.560
This is Qingyan's house!

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.719
She's my wife.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.120
Her home is my home.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.240
Right, honey?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.599
Honey!

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.840
Looks like

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.520
It really does look alike

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.479
Especially with the mask on

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.120
It's almost identical

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.719
But aren't you two a fake couple?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.280
You two weren't wearing clothes

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.879
What were you doing in the bathroom?

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:51.000
Helping each other scrub your backs

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.120
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.080
I just forgot

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.360
There was suddenly someone else at home

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.080
I didn't lock the door while showering

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.680
Then he suddenly barged in

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.319
He barged in

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:02.000
Then he's a pervert

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.400
Hey, not really

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.159
He just wanted to use the bathroom

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.400
This guy

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.840
Usually seems pretty unreliable

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.520
But he's not that bad

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.520
What do you mean, not that bad?

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.199
I'm actually a really good person

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.120
Otherwise, last night

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.960
When we slept together

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.319
It would've ended differently

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:18.120
What?

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.960
You two even slept together last night?

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:23.000
If you don't speak, no one will think you're mute

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.800
He does look quite similar.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.120
But Gaofeng

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.919
is a top elite, a business prodigy.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.840
You found a food delivery guy

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:34.919
to impersonate him.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.960
Can this really work?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.360
I know it's difficult too.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.479
But this is the only way for now.

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:42.919
If you get exposed,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.520
just move to another city.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.520
Take the money I gave you.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:48.639
You shouldn't have to worry for the rest of your life.

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:50.319
Don't worry.

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.560
I'm a great actor.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.800
Even if Gaofeng himself showed up,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.520
he'd have to admit I'm awesome.

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:56.800
So dramatic.

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:01.400
Hello?

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:06.080
Okay, got it.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.319
My family wants to meet you.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.120
Let them.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.680
With such a great husband like me,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.719
of course you should show me off to your family.

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:14.719
You should really brag about it.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.120
You make it sound so easy.

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:18.600
My uncle is domineering and overbearing.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.360
My third uncle and aunt are snobbish and mean.

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:22.759
They're all very experienced.

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:24.319
Do you really think you can fool them?

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:25.720
When the time comes,

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:27.040
just follow my lead.

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:28.040
Did you hear me?

00:04:28.519 --> 00:04:29.319
Honey,

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:30.279
don't worry.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.319
No matter what happens, I'll handle it for you.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.800
You? Handle it?

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:37.120
With what, exactly?

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.639
Don't sleep tonight.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.279
Memorize all of Gaofeng's information.

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:48.480
Let's do it this way.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.920
Will it work tomorrow?

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.839
Whatever.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.680
Let's just try whatever we can.

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:08.720
Hurry up.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.680
Are you done yet?

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.519
Done, done, almost there.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:12.480
Qingyan.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.519
They say clothes make the man.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.199
But this guy is just a deliveryman.

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.279
You can't change his temperament.

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:19.120
Even if you dress him in fancy clothes,

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.120
he still can't have Gaofeng's presence.

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:23.079
If you try to draw a tiger and fail, it just looks like a dog.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:24.319
It's even easier to give yourself away.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.519
Let's just try and see.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.160
How do I look?

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:54.680
I just changed my clothes.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.879
How did you get so handsome?

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:58.480
Alright.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.360
I'll wear this.

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.160
Young Master Song,

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:04.959
We found out that guy's information.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.000
He's not Gao Feng at all.

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:08.439
His name is Gao Xing.

00:06:08.959 --> 00:06:09.680
He only has a junior high school education.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.480
He's registered as a rural resident.

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:11.759
After coming to our Yun City,

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:13.079
he hasn't had any proper jobs.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.399
He's just been delivering food.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.879
Well, well.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.240
So he's just a delivery guy.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.480
And he dares to pretend to be someone important.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.160
Su Qingyan,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.600
do you really think I'm that easy to fool?

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.480
Let's go.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.519
Young Master Song, where are we going?

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:34.160
Of course, to the Su family.

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:37.720
Su Qingyan found herself such a good husband.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.319
I definitely have to go

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.439
and congratulate her.

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:52.920
Did you remember what I just told you?

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.199
When you see my family later,

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:55.040
don't say anything.

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:56.279
I'll handle it.

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:57.319
Got it.

00:06:57.319 --> 00:06:59.120
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:23.240
Uncle.

00:07:23.959 --> 00:07:25.160
Third Uncle, Third Aunt.

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:32.120
Qingyan,

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.040
is this the pretty boy you found behind Song Shao's back?

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.480
You'd run away from your wedding for someone like this?

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.079
I really don't know what you're thinking.

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:41.279
Is your head full of mush?

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:43.160
There's nothing between me and Song Haoyang.

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:44.519
I won't marry him.

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:45.439
Su Qingyan,

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.480
your marriage to Song Shao

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.000
was arranged by both families long ago.

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:51.079
Stop messing around outside.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.920
Whoever arranged it can marry him.

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:54.399
I don't want to marry him.

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:55.839
I'll decide my own marriage.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.000
The Su family has raised you for so many years.

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:01.399
When you enjoyed the benefits of being a Su,

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:02.399
you never complained.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.959
Now that you need to give something back to the family,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.199
you suddenly want to make your own decisions.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.399
Uncle,

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.399
my parents passed away early,

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.720
but they left me an inheritance.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.639
I haven't spent a single cent of yours.

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:15.959
These past few years,

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.800
I've also earned quite a bit for the Su family, haven't I?

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.720
The little money you made

00:08:19.839 --> 00:08:21.920
can't compare to the Song family's wealth.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.399
Marrying into the Song family

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:26.399
is the only way to bring real benefits to our Su family.

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:27.600
Uncle,

00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:29.160
why don't you just put a price tag on me

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.959
and sell me off?

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.639
I...

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.240
Enough, Qingyan.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.679
Your marriage is the Su family's top priority.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:36.759
There's no room for discussion.

00:08:36.879 --> 00:08:38.679
You must marry Song Haoyang.

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:39.840
It's too late.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.720
I've already registered my marriage with him.

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:47.200
What?

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.080
You—

00:08:48.559 --> 00:08:50.320
You’re completely out of line!

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.759
Dad.

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:54.480
It’s gone up! It’s gone up!

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.559
What’s gone up?

00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:57.200
The stock that Young Master Song told us about.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.039
It’s skyrocketed!

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.559
The twenty million we invested with Third Uncle—

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:00.879
It’s already increased by half!

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.080
We really made that much money?

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.200
Really, Mom!

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:04.960
Look, quick!

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.000
It’s still going up!

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.279
Good!

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:09.480
He’s truly the God of Wealth reincarnated.

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:10.360
It’s great that it’s gone up!

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:11.600
Qingyan, look at this.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.120
Young Master Song casually shares a bit of information,

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.320
and we can make so much money from it.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.480
If you marry him,

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.759
that’s your good fortune.

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:19.919
It’s your destiny.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.200
By the way,

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.480
your Qingmu company—

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.840
doesn’t it still need sixty million

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.320
to develop new products?

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:27.120
Young Master Song said

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.840
as soon as you two get married,

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.559
he’ll immediately invest in the Su family.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.720
And this guy—

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.679
what benefits can he bring you?

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:36.919
How can he possibly compare to Young Master Song?

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.919
Apple Technology, right?

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:42.000
Apple Technology.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
This stock isn't good.

00:09:43.759 --> 00:09:44.559
It's going to drop.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.720
You think you know about stocks?

00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:47.840
What a joke.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.919
Hmph.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.759
With my abilities, I don't need to understand.

00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:52.759
Any stock I want to rise will rise.

00:09:53.039 --> 00:09:54.440
Any stock I want to fall will fall.

00:09:58.399 --> 00:09:59.480
What are you talking about, Su Qingyan?

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.000
I really don't get you.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.320
You found yourself a pretty boy.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.759
It's bad enough he has no ability.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.080
But he's also out of his mind.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.360
Saying he can make any stock rise.

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:09.240
Or make any stock fall.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.720
Even Warren Buffett wouldn't dare say something like that.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.080
Didn't I tell you not to talk nonsense?

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:16.600
You're bragging way too much.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:17.720
Honey.

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:19.879
Aren't I the president of Junsheng Group?

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.840
This should be easy for me, right?

00:10:21.919 --> 00:10:23.159
You're a fake.

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:24.000
Others might not know,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
but don't you know yourself?

00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:27.519
What are you mumbling about?

00:10:27.679 --> 00:10:29.039
If you really have the ability,

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:31.879
make Apple Technology drop and show us.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.159
Yeah.

00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:35.679
Alright.

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:37.200
If it drops,

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.320
don't blame me.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:39.960
Drop.

00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:41.360
Drop hard.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.559
If it really drops, I'll call you grandpa.

00:10:45.559 --> 00:10:46.639
Him? As if.

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:47.840
What a disgrace.

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:50.440
Yeah, it's really embarrassing.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.720
Hello, boss. What's up?

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.519
Transfer two billion in funds for me.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.679
Within one minute.

00:10:57.799 --> 00:11:00.200
Bring down the stock price of Apple Technology.

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:01.519
Make it plunge.

00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.320
Understood.

00:11:05.759 --> 00:11:06.799
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.240
What are you trying to do?

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.360
A star company like Apple Technology—

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.120
You want to make it plunge in one minute?

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.399
You might as well just jump off a building.

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:15.840
Su Qingyan.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.919
You married an idiot like him.

00:11:18.159 --> 00:11:19.799
You're disgracing our Su family.

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:21.759
You're making us lose face.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.200
You're bragging to this extent.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.679
How are you going to end this?

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.840
Don't worry.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.279
Let the bullets fly for a while.

00:11:32.279 --> 00:11:33.440
Five.

00:11:33.919 --> 00:11:35.200
Four.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.320
That's about enough.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.000
Something's wrong, honey!

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.559
Apple Technology really dropped!

00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:54.720
What?
