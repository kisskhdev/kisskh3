1
00:00:11,149 --> 00:00:12,517
Excuse me.

2
00:00:12,584 --> 00:00:16,387
I'm Hinako Shinoda,
a reporter for the Sengoku Weekly.

3
00:00:17,388 --> 00:00:18,756
A tabloid?

4
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:22,427
I have a photo I'd like to show you
in relation to Ms. Madoka.

5
00:00:24,162 --> 00:00:26,197
Does anyone here look familiar?

6
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:34,038
I'm sorry, someone's here,
I'll be right back.

7
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:35,840
I don't want to cause a scene.

8
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:37,475
Please come inside.

9
00:00:39,878 --> 00:00:41,246
Thank you.

10
00:00:41,312 --> 00:00:42,347
Sorry.

11
00:00:47,352 --> 00:00:53,491
HASHIMOTO

12
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,696
I didn't want people to overhear,
so come inside.

13
00:00:59,297 --> 00:01:00,665
I'm so sorry!

14
00:01:00,732 --> 00:01:01,833
I'll come in.

15
00:01:07,038 --> 00:01:08,506
Let's see that picture.

16
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,910
It may not relate to
Ms. Madoka's case at all,

17
00:01:11,976 --> 00:01:14,078
but does this seem familiar to you?

18
00:01:16,414 --> 00:01:17,882
What is this picture of?

19
00:01:18,516 --> 00:01:22,120
We're currently following a story
on the fugitive Kota Kubozuka,

20
00:01:22,187 --> 00:01:24,355
and this picture turned up.

21
00:01:27,592 --> 00:01:29,727
I have one favor to ask.

22
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:34,766
Please don't share that a tabloid
reporter brought you this picture.

23
00:01:35,366 --> 00:01:36,267
The police, too?

24
00:01:37,268 --> 00:01:38,536
You mean they don't know?

25
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:40,271
We uncovered it ourselves.

26
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:44,609
But this Kubozuka
is a wanted fugitive, isn't he?

27
00:01:44,676 --> 00:01:47,278
Usually you'd submit this.
Why wouldn't you?

28
00:01:47,345 --> 00:01:49,614
We don't know if it's a lead or not.

29
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:55,286
Not telling the police first?

30
00:01:57,689 --> 00:01:58,823
What are you after?

31
00:02:02,093 --> 00:02:03,294
For a scoop?

32
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:06,564
You're doing this
to write a tabloid piece?

33
00:02:07,065 --> 00:02:10,835
That's why you're hiding
something that is potential evidence?

34
00:02:11,336 --> 00:02:14,172
Threatening me not to share it
with anyone.

35
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:20,612
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:27,652 --> 00:02:31,155
That wasn't meant as a threat.

37
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:37,528
I'm sorry for upsetting you.

38
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,836
The reason I came here today

39
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:49,941
was to learn if you had heard
from Ms. Madoka lately.

40
00:02:50,508 --> 00:02:52,343
I swear, that's all.

41
00:03:08,826 --> 00:03:11,262
Would you look at the picture again?

42
00:03:14,499 --> 00:03:17,935
If you don't recognize anything,
that's okay.

43
00:03:19,604 --> 00:03:23,441
We'll continue to look for leads
on Ms. Madoka's whereabouts.

44
00:03:26,744 --> 00:03:28,212
Please!

45
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,751
Please.

46
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:54,906
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:58,976
Could you show me again?

48
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:02,280
Thank you.

49
00:04:06,918 --> 00:04:08,653
Who is this here?

50
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,122
You don't recognize them?

51
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:14,359
I don't think so.

52
00:04:15,193 --> 00:04:16,427
Did they do it?

53
00:04:16,494 --> 00:04:20,932
All I can say is there's a possibility
they're involved.

54
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:24,669
Then you're saying it's not Kubozuka?

55
00:04:24,736 --> 00:04:26,270
I don't know yet.

56
00:04:26,337 --> 00:04:28,005
We're investigating that now.

57
00:04:28,072 --> 00:04:29,741
Sorry to ask again.

58
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:31,309
You're not the police?

59
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:33,077
No, I'm not.

60
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:37,081
But I think a tabloid reporter
can also have a role to play.

61
00:04:42,954 --> 00:04:44,389
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

62
00:04:44,455 --> 00:04:45,356
Not at all.

63
00:04:46,724 --> 00:04:48,192
I'm sorry for the intrusion.

64
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:58,136
She loved these.

65
00:04:59,737 --> 00:05:00,571
A bear?

66
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:03,941
She's waiting for Madoka, too.

67
00:05:09,747 --> 00:05:12,350
I promise to bring her home to you.

68
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,337
Ms. Shinoda?

69
00:05:34,872 --> 00:05:36,574
You're working late.

70
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:37,842
You, too.

71
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,444
So, are you taking a break?

72
00:05:41,045 --> 00:05:42,380
I feel a little stuck.

73
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,948
Me, too.

74
00:05:44,582 --> 00:05:46,551
The case has so much information,

75
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:49,220
I can barely keep up.

76
00:05:50,254 --> 00:05:53,891
I keep wondering where the truth
of this case might be hiding.

77
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:55,927
The truth of the case, huh?

78
00:06:01,632 --> 00:06:02,467
Right now,

79
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:06,804
all the information about the case

80
00:06:07,505 --> 00:06:09,307
are like stars.

81
00:06:10,575 --> 00:06:13,845
But if you draw lines between those stars,

82
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:17,715
you'll discover a new constellation.

83
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:20,818
What?

84
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,089
Something a detective said
in the novel I'm editing.

85
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:31,329
So how about you pretend to be
the protagonist of my mystery novel.

86
00:06:32,096 --> 00:06:33,197
I want you to find a star.

87
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:40,671
I'm sure you just haven't found
the constellations in the darkness yet.

88
00:06:40,738 --> 00:06:46,511
Okay, I guess I'll keep looking
for these stars you're talking about.

89
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:47,478
Nice!

90
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:50,147
You're Detective Hinako Shinoda.

91
00:06:50,214 --> 00:06:52,450
So like this?

92
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,755
I need to work hard too.

93
00:06:58,923 --> 00:06:59,891
You got this.

94
00:07:01,192 --> 00:07:02,527
Have a good night.

95
00:07:02,593 --> 00:07:03,895
You too.

96
00:07:12,003 --> 00:07:13,838
It was another fake tip.

97
00:07:13,905 --> 00:07:15,373
I came up with nothing too.

98
00:07:17,608 --> 00:07:18,509
Good work.

99
00:07:18,576 --> 00:07:19,844
You too.

100
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:20,845
Good work.

101
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:22,313
So?

102
00:07:22,947 --> 00:07:24,282
Find the Sunglasses Man?

103
00:07:24,348 --> 00:07:26,017
Not yet, I'm sorry.

104
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,853
It's fine. Take your time.

105
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,054
What's that?

106
00:07:30,121 --> 00:07:32,990
I got pictures from
the marriage mixer organizers.

107
00:07:36,961 --> 00:07:39,096
What are the pictures of?

108
00:07:39,864 --> 00:07:43,301
They sent every picture they've taken
for all their mixers.

109
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:49,273
There's even pictures of staff including
cooks, waiters, florists, and cameramen.

110
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,342
Thought it could help.

111
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:55,313
But it seems hard to find the Sunglasses
Man from all these.

112
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,782
Plus, he might not be wearing sunglasses.

113
00:08:00,585 --> 00:08:01,485
Wait.

114
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:10,761
He looks somewhat similar.

115
00:08:10,828 --> 00:08:12,530
Vaguely, though.

116
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:19,503
Hold on.

117
00:08:20,204 --> 00:08:23,941
I feel like I saw him in a picture
I got from Ms. Iijima.

118
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:28,446
In a picture from an industry party.

119
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:32,783
Look!

120
00:08:33,351 --> 00:08:34,118
This man.

121
00:08:38,055 --> 00:08:41,926
They do seem alike and
have similar features around the mouth.

122
00:08:42,493 --> 00:08:43,461
True.

123
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:46,030
I'll check with Ms. Iijima.

124
00:08:46,097 --> 00:08:48,566
I'll ask the party organizer tomorrow.

125
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:49,467
Okay.

126
00:08:58,609 --> 00:09:00,378
According to Ms. Iijima,

127
00:09:00,444 --> 00:09:06,050
the Sunglasses Man looks like the first
victim Harue Komiyama's nephew.

128
00:09:06,117 --> 00:09:07,885
His name is Atsuhiro Imamura.

129
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:11,188
He's the son of Harue Komiyama's
older sister.

130
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:13,791
She died a few years ago,

131
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:19,664
and Ms. Komiyama would give
her nephew work and financial support.

132
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,198
Financial support?

133
00:09:21,265 --> 00:09:25,069
If he was relying on his successful aunt,
he'd be in her debt.

134
00:09:25,836 --> 00:09:29,206
As a beauty consultant, she had money.

135
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:30,875
What is Imamura's job?

136
00:09:30,941 --> 00:09:33,344
It seems he worked at a design firm,

137
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:35,713
but he quit and started his own company.

138
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,781
May I interject?

139
00:09:37,648 --> 00:09:38,582
What is it?

140
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,652
Ms. Komiyama's sister
and parents passed away, right?

141
00:09:42,219 --> 00:09:43,020
Yes.

142
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:47,558
If she earned a fortune as a consultant,

143
00:09:47,625 --> 00:09:50,795
her nephew would
inherit everything, wouldn't he?

144
00:09:54,532 --> 00:09:57,735
Dai, look into Imamura
and Komiyama's relationship.

145
00:09:57,802 --> 00:09:58,602
Okay.

146
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:01,038
INHERITANCE?

147
00:10:01,105 --> 00:10:02,907
Anything else, Murai?

148
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:05,209
Oh, take a look at this photo.

149
00:10:06,143 --> 00:10:10,047
It's one of the photos we got
from the marriage mixer organizers.

150
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:12,917
This man looks like the Sunglasses Man.

151
00:10:13,918 --> 00:10:16,320
We don't know if he's the same person.

152
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:18,656
Yamabuki went to verify it.

153
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:21,092
If it's the same person,

154
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:25,296
that connects Makiko Tanioka's case
and Harue Komiyama's.

155
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:29,033
Still, I'm not seeing the big picture.

156
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:35,106
Excuse me.

157
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,409
What was the Akasaka Cave again?

158
00:10:38,909 --> 00:10:40,444
It's a cave bar in Akasaka.

159
00:10:41,045 --> 00:10:44,482
It's where Ms. Komiyama met with
Kubozuka before her death.

160
00:10:45,216 --> 00:10:46,250
A cave bar.

161
00:10:47,017 --> 00:10:49,987
It's pretty interesting,
drinking booze in the dark.

162
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:54,658
They hand you a lantern at the entrance,
and your eyes have to adjust.

163
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:56,660
I had no idea what we were drinking.

164
00:10:57,795 --> 00:10:59,697
But you ordered the drinks!

165
00:10:59,764 --> 00:11:01,332
That's how dark it was.

166
00:11:01,398 --> 00:11:03,300
Maybe Kubozuka drugged her then.

167
00:11:03,868 --> 00:11:05,836
That's totally possible.

168
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:06,971
I'm back.

169
00:11:07,037 --> 00:11:07,872
Great!

170
00:11:07,938 --> 00:11:09,607
I visited the organizer's office.

171
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:10,608
Any pushback?

172
00:11:10,674 --> 00:11:12,977
No, they helped look for new pictures.

173
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:14,445
Sorry for being so late.

174
00:11:14,512 --> 00:11:16,680
I got details on the Sunglasses Man.

175
00:11:18,415 --> 00:11:19,416
Let's see.

176
00:11:20,718 --> 00:11:23,554
He was involved with the marriage mixer.

177
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:26,390
He was in charge of their website design.

178
00:11:27,858 --> 00:11:28,926
Web designer?

179
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:31,662
They weren't expecting him at the party,

180
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:33,798
but he said he came in for work.

181
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:37,468
Which is why he likely got past reception
without signing in.

182
00:11:37,535 --> 00:11:38,736
Did you get his name?

183
00:11:38,803 --> 00:11:39,637
Yes.

184
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:42,640
Atsuhiro Imamura.

185
00:11:57,054 --> 00:11:59,623
Yamabuki, go to the venue now

186
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,159
and check if he really had business there.

187
00:12:02,226 --> 00:12:03,060
Okay.

188
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:07,932
Shinoda and Murai, go to
his former workplace and ask questions.

189
00:12:07,998 --> 00:12:08,833
Okay.

190
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:12,703
It's Akutsu.

191
00:12:13,571 --> 00:12:14,638
Put him on speaker.

192
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:18,209
Yes, what's up?

193
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:19,944
Good evening.

194
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:25,049
I was eavesdropping on someone
from Aoshiro's company,

195
00:12:25,115 --> 00:12:27,785
and they were worried about
the Truth Weekly.

196
00:12:29,253 --> 00:12:30,287
What do you mean?

197
00:12:30,354 --> 00:12:35,426
It seems the Truth Weekly reporter is in
contact with one of Aoshiro's employees.

198
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,262
Why the hell are they in contact?

199
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:42,266
Apparently, the Truth Weekly got ahold
of Aoshiro's former secretary,

200
00:12:42,766 --> 00:12:44,735
who seems to be their source.

201
00:12:44,802 --> 00:12:47,571
Seriously? What information
is she giving them?

202
00:12:48,072 --> 00:12:49,840
I believe it's about his relationships.

203
00:12:50,407 --> 00:12:54,011
Ms. Kizaki, the second victim's name,
came up.

204
00:12:54,712 --> 00:12:55,779
Yuko Kizaki.

205
00:12:56,647 --> 00:12:57,948
This is Tsubaki.

206
00:12:58,682 --> 00:12:59,750
Yes, hello.

207
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:05,089
I got information that Yuko Kizaki
was an investor who invested in Aoshiro.

208
00:13:05,155 --> 00:13:06,023
Is that right?

209
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,525
The secretary knows about that too.

210
00:13:08,592 --> 00:13:12,129
I also heard Aoshiro gave Yuko Kizaki
a key to his apartment.

211
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:15,666
But Aoshiro has an alibi
for the second victim.

212
00:13:16,267 --> 00:13:20,838
So the Truth Weekly thinks Aoshiro
came up with the plan

213
00:13:20,905 --> 00:13:23,474
and Kubozuka carried it out.

214
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,309
That's my guess.

215
00:13:25,376 --> 00:13:28,879
Which means the Truth Weekly's headline
would be like

216
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:34,018
"Handsome Businessman's Dark Secret:
The Mysterious Death of a Young Beauty."

217
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:40,658
What we fear is them finding
strong evidence against Aoshiro.

218
00:13:41,358 --> 00:13:43,327
Akutsu, thanks for the report.

219
00:13:43,394 --> 00:13:45,729
Of course. I'll keep watching Aoshiro.

220
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:47,364
I made up my mind!

221
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:51,669
This will be the top story
for our next issue.

222
00:13:53,837 --> 00:13:54,905
Hold on.

223
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:57,574
We need to investigate more first.

224
00:13:57,641 --> 00:14:01,946
Either we get outscooped
by the Truth Weekly or we outscoop them.

225
00:14:02,012 --> 00:14:04,181
-It's one or the other.
-I get that.

226
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:06,951
But this is a big story
I've been chasing since last autumn.

227
00:14:07,017 --> 00:14:10,020
Don't worry, be confident
and get back to it.

228
00:14:10,087 --> 00:14:11,822
I don't want to fall short.

229
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:13,624
One wrong move, and we get sued.

230
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:15,559
You know that better than anyone.

231
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:18,262
Murai, we have an ace up our sleeve.

232
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:20,197
It will stain our record.

233
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:23,801
I urge for discretion here.

234
00:14:31,976 --> 00:14:35,179
Look, I don't know what that man's done,

235
00:14:35,245 --> 00:14:37,214
but I'm not covering for him.

236
00:14:37,281 --> 00:14:38,749
He already left our company.

237
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:42,686
Plus, he was a designer in name only.

238
00:14:43,387 --> 00:14:46,390
He kept bragging about
his successful aunt.

239
00:14:47,124 --> 00:14:51,328
Also, he wasn't the type to have his fun
partying it up with everyone.

240
00:14:51,395 --> 00:14:55,699
More like get sucked into
some weird, shady hobby.

241
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:56,867
A shady hobby?

242
00:14:56,934 --> 00:14:58,035
What kind exactly?

243
00:14:58,102 --> 00:15:01,238
The type of hobby I can't share.

244
00:15:01,305 --> 00:15:04,441
Like bondage for example?

245
00:15:05,976 --> 00:15:06,977
I can't say.

246
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:08,545
That's the nature.

247
00:15:08,612 --> 00:15:11,081
You said you wouldn't cover for him.

248
00:15:11,148 --> 00:15:12,716
I wouldn't cover for him,

249
00:15:13,384 --> 00:15:15,886
but as a fellow man,
I'll protect his dignity.

250
00:15:17,654 --> 00:15:18,789
We done?

251
00:15:18,856 --> 00:15:20,190
Keep me anonymous, okay?

252
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,127
Thank you.

253
00:15:23,193 --> 00:15:24,328
Thank you.

254
00:15:28,232 --> 00:15:29,833
We're back.

255
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:31,602
Welcome back.

256
00:15:36,707 --> 00:15:37,775
What happened?

257
00:15:40,978 --> 00:15:42,479
Kitahama pulled some strings

258
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:46,083
to dig up the Truth Weekly's
secret weapon.

259
00:15:48,052 --> 00:15:51,221
Turns out it's pretty big.

260
00:15:52,956 --> 00:15:56,293
Aoshiro's currently dating
a famous actress.

261
00:15:57,561 --> 00:16:01,131
It's the cherry they need to put on top
the suspicious deaths.

262
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:03,434
They're going to lead with it for sure.

263
00:16:04,134 --> 00:16:08,472
If they do, the editor-in-chief
won't let us lead with our story.

264
00:16:09,807 --> 00:16:13,777
It means all we can do
is sit back and watch.

265
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:18,482
Mr. Kitahama.

266
00:16:19,249 --> 00:16:20,317
We can't.

267
00:16:20,384 --> 00:16:23,087
Even if we break Imamura's story,
it's too late.

268
00:16:24,655 --> 00:16:27,724
Like you said, we still have
more to investigate.

269
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:30,727
We were too slow.

270
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,164
Mr. Murai.

271
00:16:35,466 --> 00:16:37,234
We ran a good race.

272
00:16:37,768 --> 00:16:39,470
Doesn't matter if it's buried.

273
00:16:40,938 --> 00:16:43,273
Akutsu, good work on the stakeout.

274
00:16:45,042 --> 00:16:45,909
Well.

275
00:16:46,877 --> 00:16:48,112
I'm still bitter.

276
00:16:49,813 --> 00:16:51,181
How can it end like this?

277
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,553
Look, it happens in our industry.

278
00:16:57,187 --> 00:16:58,489
It's cruel, sure.

279
00:17:00,257 --> 00:17:01,325
But it's normal.

280
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,198
Just be sure to thank everyone
like Ms. Iijima who helped out.

281
00:17:08,866 --> 00:17:10,434
-Yes, sir.
-Thanks.

282
00:17:41,131 --> 00:17:42,232
Cave bar…

283
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:43,834
Darkness.

284
00:17:44,368 --> 00:17:45,636
Kubozuka.

285
00:17:46,537 --> 00:17:48,705
Was with her the day before her death.

286
00:17:52,176 --> 00:17:53,477
Komiyama.

287
00:17:53,544 --> 00:17:54,511
Inheritance.

288
00:17:54,912 --> 00:17:56,013
Imamura.

289
00:17:57,648 --> 00:17:59,216
A shady hobby?

290
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:06,056
Imamura and Komiyama.

291
00:18:06,623 --> 00:18:07,791
Vaguely

292
00:18:10,427 --> 00:18:11,628
resemble each other?

293
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:15,532
DARKNESS

294
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:16,567
SHADY HOBBY

295
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,142
What is it?

296
00:18:25,976 --> 00:18:32,015
A witness said Ms. Komiyama met with
Kubozuka the day before her death.

297
00:18:32,082 --> 00:18:36,420
But was it really Harue Komiyama
who Kubozuka met with?

298
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:44,027
We heard Atsuhiro Imamura
had a shady hobby.

299
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:48,165
Perhaps that hobby was crossdressing.

300
00:18:48,232 --> 00:18:49,266
Crossdressing?

301
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:54,905
So maybe Kubozuka met with Imamura who
was dressed like a woman at the cave bar

302
00:18:54,972 --> 00:18:56,940
and not Harue Komiyama.

303
00:18:57,007 --> 00:19:02,879
Then Mr. Imamura killed Ms. Komiyama
and framed Kubozuka.

304
00:19:02,946 --> 00:19:04,381
What's Imamura's motive?

305
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:06,717
The inheritance?

306
00:19:08,352 --> 00:19:09,186
Most likely.

307
00:19:09,253 --> 00:19:10,654
INHERITANCE?

308
00:19:10,721 --> 00:19:12,889
Mr. Murai, Yamabuki.

309
00:19:12,956 --> 00:19:14,224
Su, Dai, Attsu.

310
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:18,862
Go try to verify if Imamura
was into crossdressing.

311
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:19,896
Yes, sir!

312
00:19:21,098 --> 00:19:22,065
Shinoda.

313
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:25,235
Good catch.

314
00:19:25,302 --> 00:19:27,404
Can we still go for the top story?

315
00:19:27,971 --> 00:19:28,805
Oh, yeah.

316
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:31,742
It's a walk-off grand slam.

317
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:36,013
This could be a big scoop.

318
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,714
-I'll go too!
-Okay.

319
00:19:48,258 --> 00:19:49,893
TO BE CONTINUED

320
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,929
We're launching a camouflage tactic.

321
00:19:52,996 --> 00:19:54,798
Who's good at lying low?

322
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:58,702
We have to find some evidence
to make it for the next issue.

323
00:19:58,769 --> 00:20:01,438
A tabloid like us made a breakthrough.

324
00:20:01,505 --> 00:20:03,507
It's all over for tabloids!

325
00:20:03,573 --> 00:20:05,876
