00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:43.159
Stop!

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.840
Let go!

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:47.240
Tell me.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.159
How did you know I wasn't here?

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.679
You admit it?

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.079
You were testing me?

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.039
How did you know?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.399
Say it.

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.159
The rain started after we came back.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.799
But there were muddy footprints
in the bathroom.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.000
So

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.319
you must have gone out.

00:01:14.879 --> 00:01:16.560
You're the "intruder" they want, right?

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.959
How about we make a deal?

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:22.239
If you let me go,

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:25.200
I promise I won't tell anyone about it.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.120
You think since you know about that,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.519
you can threaten me?

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:38.959
I can kill you right now.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.079
Go ahead.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.000
Kill me.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.519
Are you really not afraid of death?

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.519
I am.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.079
I'm so afraid of death.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.319
So I'm trying to
find a way to live, right?

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.680
If they can't find the intruder tonight,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.199
they'll naturally suspect someone here.

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.280
If you kill me now,

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.599
no one can testify for you.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.039
I bet you'll end up like me.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.360
Either let me go,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.520
or

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.520
we die together.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.240
I really underestimated you.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.360
But I hate being threatened.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.360
What are you doing?

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.360
What is this?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.599
If I press this,

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.039
the thing on your ankle
will explode immediately.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.240
Forget about removing it.

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.039
Because only I have the code.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.360
You're mad.

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:17.840
Everyone here is mad.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.439
If you dare to say a word,

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.159
you will surely die.

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:25.039
Why do this to me?

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.039
I just want to go home.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.759
Useless!

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.759
You mean

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.719
the ledger was stolen?

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.439
If we can't find it,

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.919
we will both die.

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.120
Kun, I swear.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.199
My security was airtight.

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.800
Not even a fly could get in.

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:53.879
Then tell me,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.120
how did the intruder get in?

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.120
Could it be

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.919
that we have a mole here?

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.400
K, open the door.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.759
Tonight, someone was indeed

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.240
quite suspicious.

00:04:22.839 --> 00:04:23.759
What are you doing?

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.800
(No, I can't confront him directly now.)

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:31.839
I want to take a shower.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.040
Everyone here is mad.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.160
If you dare to say a word,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.680
you will surely die.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.360
(Keeping her
will eventually be a problem.)

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:09.600
(Even though he doesn't kill me now,)

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:11.600
(there's no guarantee later he will...)

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.759
Why took so long?

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:23.079
Well...

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:24.920
Can you give me some other clothes?

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.639
What are you doing?

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:32.680
Stop.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.759
I'll have someone
bring you some clothes later.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.560
K.

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:58.800
Kun wants to see you.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Got it.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.800
I warn you.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:14.439
Stay in this room.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.920
Or face the consequences.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.439
(There are so many guards outside.)

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.319
(There's no way to escape.)

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.439
Take her.

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:41.439
Kun,

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.000
why don't we interrogate K directly?

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:44.560
You think I don't want to?

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.240
If we do anything to him

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:48.920
but find out nothing,

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:50.560
the boss will be unhappy.

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:53.040
But this woman

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.920
can let me know a lot of things.

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:58.000
Kun, you're so wise.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.360
You don't think

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.199
K will come to save you, do you?

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.319
I am his person now.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.240
Aren't you afraid

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.959
that he'll come after you?

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:14.319
K

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.560
would offend me for a mere plaything?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.720
Tell me.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.839
Did K leave the room last night?

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:22.680
(I can't tell him.)

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.399
(If I do, I'll die immediately.)

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:29.079
No.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:30.680
No.

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:34.040
I knew you wouldn't talk so easily.

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.199
So

00:07:36.079 --> 00:07:37.879
I've prepared something nice for you

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:39.199
to "entertain" you well.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.959
This is something worse than death.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:43.959
Wait.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.040
What?

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:46.160
You'll talk now?

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.639
We...

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:52.000
We didn't leave the room.

00:07:53.399 --> 00:07:54.279
Are you fooling me?

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.879
But I can help you.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.319
What?

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.639
I can monitor him for you.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.879
With just you?

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.519
With just me.

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:06.920
He took me here.

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:09.160
He won't guard against me.

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:13.319
Gu Nian,

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.639
why should I trust you?

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:17.879
Because

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.480
I want to live.

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:22.079
You want to live?

00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:23.560
Alright.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.279

00:08:25.279 --> 00:08:26.839
K left the room last night,

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:28.360
I'll let you go immediately.

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:31.879
But if you don't say it,

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.639

she could sneak
past your guards to steal?

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.720
I didn't tell you

that someone stole something last night.
