WEBVTT

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.240
Alright, I understand.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.375
The first batch of Huichundan
has been completed.

00:00:17.399 --> 00:00:18.216
It has passed inspection.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.480
It can be launched at any time.

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.839
Now our Qingmu is really
going to make a fortune.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.559
This time, it's truly thanks
to the efforts of all our staff.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.375
I will definitely reward everyone
according to their contributions.

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:30.495
Everyone will be well rewarded.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:31.519
Absolutely.

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.039
We've really been exhausted lately.

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:37.256
Once the product is launched,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.015
we should really take some time to relax.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.039
No problem.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:47.136
This is bad.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.040
The Song family has gathered several
media outlets to smear our product.

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:50.736
What?

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.856
Look, over a dozen
media outlets in Yun City

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:53.857
plus a huge number of online trolls

00:00:53.881 --> 00:00:55.015
are all slandering our Qingmu brand.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.879
They're spreading rumors
about our Huichundan.

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.119
That Song Haoyang is truly despicable.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.375
If public opinion is
controlled by the Song family,

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:02.655
then no matter how good our Huichundan is,

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:03.560
we still won't be able to sell it.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.760
So what do we do now?

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.159
Should we hold a press
conference to clarify things?

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.280
It won't work.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.335
The Song family is powerful
and influential in Yun City.

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:12.135
We can't win a public
opinion battle against them.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.335
The only way now

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:15.055
is to quickly find a spokesperson

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:15.935
to speak up for Qingmu.

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:16.999
To restore our reputation.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.376
But this happened so suddenly.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.760
Where can we find a popular
celebrity on such short notice?

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:23.120
In Yun City,

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:24.935
the only suitable candidate right now

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.799
is my college classmate, Xiao Yaqi.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:28.256
We studied together for four years.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.976
After graduation, she entered
the entertainment industry.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.376
She's gained some
fame in the past two years.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.799
Now she's a second-tier actress.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.400
If we can get her,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.480
maybe we can turn things around.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.335
But Xiao Yaqi is very arrogant.

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:40.616
She's conceited and self-important.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.120
You didn't get along with her before.

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:43.920
If you really ask her for help,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.760
she definitely won't be nice to you.

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:48.239
It doesn't matter.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.599
For the company's reputation,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.760
I have to give it a try.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.200
You want me to be your spokesperson.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.040
With just your company, Qingmu?

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.680
Are you even worthy?

00:01:58.879 --> 00:01:59.879
You...

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.920
Yaqi.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.280
I know you had issues
with me back in school.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.000
But right now, Qingmu is really in trouble.

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:10.176
Look,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.536
could you help me out for the sake
of our old classmate relationship?

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.560
Do me this favor.

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.919
We can discuss the
endorsement fee and everything.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.039
Qingmu's problems have
nothing to do with me.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.199
Besides,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.376
I'm really popular right now.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.240
My endorsement fees
start at tens of millions.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.240
Can Qingmu even afford that?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.400
Tens of millions?

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:30.575
Only top celebrities charge that much.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.959
Why don't you just go rob someone?

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.720
You think it's too expensive?

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.096
If it's too expensive, you
don't have to ask me for help.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.400
I'm not forcing you.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.096
Tens of millions is a bit much, honestly.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.719
How about we negotiate a bit more?

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.960
Of course, since we
were classmates after all.

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.759
I'm not that heartless, you know.

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.977
As for this favor,

00:02:51.001 --> 00:02:52.120
it's not like I can't help.

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.759
But it depends on your sincerity.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:57.759
As long as you can help me,

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.479
Just tell me, I'll do my best.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.560
I'm thirsty. Get me a glass of water.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.120
Okay.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.319
Are you trying to burn me?

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:24.960
Get me something cooler.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:28.439
Alright.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.415
It's not hot anymore.

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.439
Try it again.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.360
It's too cold.

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.376
I won't drink it if it's cold.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.480
Xiao Yaqi, you're doing
this on purpose, aren't you?

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.135
After all, you were classmates before.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.479
Aren't you going too far?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.879
Classmates.

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.479
Back in school, she was
always stealing my spotlight.

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:54.520
Now the tables have turned.

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.520
If you don't want to,
you can leave anytime.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.560
It's fine, I'll pour it for you.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.599
The temperature is
just right this time, try it.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.136
You...

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.759
Oh!

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.759
I'm really sorry.

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:23.519
I accidentally got my shoe wet.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.839
Why don't you wipe it for me?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.480
Xiao Yaqi, don't go too far.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.519
I am going too far.

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.800
What can you do about it?

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:32.935
Not convinced?

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:35.399
If you don't like it, you
don't have to ask me for help.

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.479
A third-rate little celebrity, and
you still get to act all high and mighty.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.336
What level are you, anyway?

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.600
You think you're worthy of
having my wife serve you tea?

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:48.959
Gao Xing.

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:51.439
Why are you here?

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.080
I was just worried you might be wronged.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.199
You're my wife.

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:57.159
Just a third-rate minor celebrity like this.

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:58.935
There's no need for you
to lower yourself like this.

00:04:58.959 --> 00:05:00.096
Who do you want as your spokesperson?

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.959
With just one call from me,

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:02.519
you can pick any superstar you want.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.879
As if you could really pick anyone.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.776
In the whole entertainment
industry, the only one who can do that

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.735
is the so-called
godfather of entertainment,

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.120
Chu Jiangchao, the CEO of Zhongyu.

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:14.456
Who do you think you are?

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.399
Don't make things worse.

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:16.439
Su Qingyan.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.439
Is this the man you found?

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.120
He isn't an idiot, is he?

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.399
Gao Xing, stop making a scene.

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:25.800
It's fine, leave it to me.

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.120
Sit.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.399
You're Xiao Yaqi, right?

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:35.879
Let me give you a piece of advice.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.336
It's an honor for you to be
the spokesperson for Qingmu.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.839
You'd better not be ungrateful.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.639
Are you trying to make me laugh to death?

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:47.776
I'm Xiao Yaqi, a top celebrity.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.080
My popularity is off the charts.

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:51.336
Companies wanting me as their spokesperson

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.216
could line up from Yuncheng
all the way to Beijing.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.800
Any one of them

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:57.839
is ten or a hundred times
better than your Qingmu.

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:59.519
And you actually say

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.560
that it's my honor to represent Qingmu?

00:06:04.879 --> 00:06:05.935
You think that's funny, huh?

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:09.160
Use your brain and think it over.

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:10.600
You guys

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.240
are you even worthy?

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:14.240
Gao Xing, let's go.

00:06:14.319 --> 00:06:15.599
We're not signing this contract.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.920
Honey,

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.120
don't worry, I'm here.

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.375
Today, she'll sign this contract
whether she wants to or not.

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:23.799
She has to sign it, no matter what.

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:31.839
Chu Jiangchao.

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:34.199
I want to sign Xiao Yaqi
as our spokesperson.

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:36.096
Now, at your fastest speed,

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.560
deliver the contract to her.

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:39.319
Have her sign it for me.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.600
Yes.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:42.840
Mr. Gao, please rest assured.

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:44.239
I'll take care of it right away.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.560
President Chu, is this
Mr. Gao very influential?

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:50.319
Even someone of your status
treats him with such respect.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.560
There are plenty of
influential people out there.

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.720
My respect for Mr. Gao

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.240
is not just because of his status,

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:58.519
or his power,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.079
but because he has extraordinary abilities

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:02.656
and is still willing to humble himself

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.560
to help those in need.

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:07.639
He has done countless
good deeds over the years.

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:10.600
Even I have benefited
greatly from his kindness.

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:13.120
By the way,

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:16.120
which superstar is this Xiao Yaqi?

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:17.839
How come I've never heard of her?

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:21.319
President Chu, Xiao Yaqi isn't a superstar.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.960
She's gained a bit of
fame in the past two years.

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.800
At best, she's a second-tier celebrity.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.040
Second-tier?

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:31.639
With Mr. Gao personally making the request,

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:35.000
even top superstars

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.920
would be scrambling to help.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.720
But for just a second-tier celebrity,

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.000
he actually has to step in himself.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.399
Forget it.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.480
Contact Xiao Yaqi's agency.

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:48.839
Have their boss answer the phone.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.560
Yes, I'll take care of it right away.

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:55.336
You were even pretending to call Mr. Chu.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.720
You acted so convincingly.

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.776
Do you want me to help you join a film crew

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.415
and get a bit part as an extra?

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:01.560
Su Qingyan.

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:04.120
Weren't you always so proud back in school?

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:08.240
How come you ended up with a clown now?

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.480
Don't worry.

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.136
You'll soon find out who the real clown is.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.720
Gaoxing, stop messing around.

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:15.680
Xiao Yaqi is really popular right now.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.800
She has a high status in
the entertainment industry.

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:19.199
Other than her agency,

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:20.735
the boss of Miracle Media

00:08:20.759 --> 00:08:22.175
no one can force her to sign a contract.

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:22.896
Gaoxing, that's enough.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:23.777
Stop acting.

00:08:23.801 --> 00:08:25.199
You really can't help with this.

00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:28.399
Hey, not necessarily.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:31.016
Didn't your husband
just call Chu Jiangchao,

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.360
Mr. Chu?

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:33.855
Maybe,

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:36.775
Mr. Chu will actually put
pressure on my agency.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.296
My boss might already be
on the way with the contract.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.919
He could be on his way right now.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:44.279
Do you hear footsteps?

00:08:44.919 --> 00:08:48.840
Maybe my boss is already here.

00:08:49.919 --> 00:08:50.919
Xiao Yaqi.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:56.775
Mr. Zhang.

00:08:56.799 --> 00:08:57.919
Why are you here?

00:08:58.519 --> 00:08:59.799
Who is this?

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:02.440
Zhang Qishan, the boss of Miracle Media.

00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:04.199
Your endorsement contract with Qingmu.

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:05.679
What?

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:10.839
The company wants me to sign
an endorsement deal with Qingmu.
