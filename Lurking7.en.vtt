00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:44.880
You're awake.

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:49.719
Rest assured.
They won't find this place.

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:54.439
Your clothes were soaked.

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.039
So I changed them.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.719
Let me go!

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:12.319
If you want to kill me, do it.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.680
If I wanted you dead,

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:15.280
I wouldn't save you.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.400
If you really want to save me,

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.760
let me go.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.000
You can't leave yet.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:24.599
Move aside.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:26.319
Where are you going?

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.920
Peng Li is searching for you.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.319
So what?

00:01:29.519 --> 00:01:30.599
I'm leaving anyway.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.120
I don't want to see you.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.599
Do you hate seeing me that much?

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:40.400
Yes. I never want to see you again.

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.920
Don't you know what Peng Li is like?

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.359
Stop being so stubborn.

00:01:48.879 --> 00:01:50.200
Can't you just trust me? Don't...

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.200
I trusted him before.
Look where that got me.

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:57.000
If I had rushed to save you,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.359
Peng Li would've killed you.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.400
I tried to save you later,

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.159
but it was too late.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.799
Gu Nian,

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.719
you shot me

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:08.560
and slapped me.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.000
Haven't you vented enough?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.520
Are you done talking?

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.199
Can you let me go now?

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.479
If it's inconvenient for you,

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:19.599
give me the phone.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.080
My senior brother will pick me up.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.400
What senior brother?

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:26.360
It's none of your business.

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.120
I don't have a phone.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.800
Fine.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.080
I'll leave on my own.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.400
You won't get out of here
without me guiding you.

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:04.080
I'll do it myself.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.719
Don't worry.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.919
After I send you away,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.479
we won't meet again.

00:03:28.701 --> 00:03:31.062
(Police Station)

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.199
We've arrived.

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.960
Tell me.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.840
Didn't you say my life
has nothing to do with you?

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.879
Why did you come back for me?

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.599
Now that I saved you,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.879
you shouldn't report me anymore.

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.120
I advise you to turn yourself in.

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:59.360
Is there anything else?

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.680
Take care.

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:31.872
What are you doing?

00:04:33.882 --> 00:04:36.959
(You and Gu Nian are wanted.)

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:38.319
We're wanted by the police?

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.839
Let's go.

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:42.800
Stop!

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.319
Don't move, or I'll shoot!

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.079
Why would the police want us?

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.439
The cop on the rooftop is dead.

00:04:58.839 --> 00:05:00.720
Surveillance caught us at the scene.

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:02.639
Dead?

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:05.279
You killed him?

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.319
If I say I didn't do it,

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:10.600
would you believe me?

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.839
I don't know.

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:21.959
All I know is since I left the island,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.680
I've been either hunted or wanted
all the time.

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.959
You can tell the police

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:32.920
that I forced you into everything.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.800
When did you get hurt?

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:57.480
(Gunshot wound.)

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:01.519
Weren't you leaving?

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.639
You can go now.

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:03.519
Just leave me.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.319
Don't worry. I'll leave.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.439
But not now.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.399
