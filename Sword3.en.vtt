Take this.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.840
Please extend my rent
for a few more days.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.400
I'm trying...

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.040
Madam Zhang.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.350
When will you ever pay up

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.390
at this rate?

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.360
My family needs the money.

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.520
I...

00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:49.040
- Just a few more days.
- But...

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.040
Yes.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.640
I need to feed my family.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.480
Madam Zhang...

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:54.950
How much more does she owe?

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.190
2000 yuan.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.400
Here's 500 yuan.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.400
Here's 1500 yuan.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.120
That's enough, right?

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.710
Yes.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.920
Okay, Madam Zhang.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.240
So, please remember

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.790
to pay your rent earlier

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.680
to make everyone's lives easier, okay?

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.550
Sure.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.200
I'm off, then.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.680
Sure.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.670
Enjoy your day.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.150
Okay.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.150

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.680
I'm so sorry about this.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.520
I...

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.830
It's a loan, okay?

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.800
As soon as I have the money,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.470
I'll pay you back at once.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.960
It's okay,

Madam Zhang.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.880
I dine here often, after all.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.320
If you feel bad about it,

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.680
think of it as

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.520
my rent

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.230

You, working here?

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.760
This shabby eatery

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.440
isn't good enough for a lawyer like you.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.510
I love the hustle

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.590
and bustle here.

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:54.640
By the way, Madam Zhang...

This girl here

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.760
is Luo Xiaoxing.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.200
She's come to Linshan
to look for her brother,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.240
and she's been

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.230
asking for help on the streets.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.640
She hasn't had any food.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.070
Do you think

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.320
you can hire her

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.830
and provide her

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.950
with a place to stay?

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.320
Madam Zhang.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:17.880
Xiaoxing.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.710
Hello, Madam Zhang.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.120
Poor girl.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.830
It must be tough for a girl like you
to be on the streets.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.360
Why don't you

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.950
stay at my place?

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.640
You see,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.960
everyone here

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.040
can be your family.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.990
- Okay?
- Yeah.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.000
Thank you, Madam Zhang.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.990
Get up.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.710
Thank you!

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.270
This is my brother, Luo Xiaoyu.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.360
I've been searching
for him for 15 years.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.270
As long as I can find him,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.950
I'll do whatever it takes.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:03.590
Thank you.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.150
There, there.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.160
It's okay, Xiaoxing.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.560

Don't worry.

We'll help you.

Rest assured.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:24.710
Okay?

Don't cry.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.400

and I found a buyer,
but now he's missing!

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.080
I'm not.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.577
Don't touch me!

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:25.750
Her family is on the way here.

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.360
Don't touch me!

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.680
We need to proceed with treatment.

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.600
Please leave the room.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.222
I know, but she's in
a state of fear now.

00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:31.030
Zhou Min.

00:12:31.066 --> 00:12:31.769
Zhou Min.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.279
- Get someone to help!
- They're doctors.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.200
Don't be afraid. We're
in a hospital now, okay?

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.230
Help me!

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.830
Let go of me first.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:38.750
Let go of me,

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:40.533
so that the doctor
can examine you, okay?

00:12:40.533 --> 00:12:41.400
Don't go!

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.040
Don't be afraid.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.320
Help me!

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:45.720
Help me!

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.510
Be gentle.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.790
Be gentle. She's hurt.

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:48.390
Be gentle.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.200
Don't go!

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.040
It's a trauma attack.

00:12:50.066 --> 00:12:51.150
We need to deal with it now.

00:12:51.155 --> 00:12:52.200
Please leave the room now!

00:12:52.266 --> 00:12:52.990
Okay.

00:12:53.866 --> 00:12:54.910
Please leave the room now!

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:55.390
Okay.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.200
Be gentle on her.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.150
She's injured.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.110
Don't touch me!

00:12:58.360 --> 00:12:59.230
Don't touch me!

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:00.630
Don't touch me!

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.270
Save me!

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:03.200
Take me away!

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:04.390
(Don't touch me!)

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:05.320
(Take me away!)

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.660
(Hospital)
(Keep Quiet)

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:13.960
Director,

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:14.960
you should go back.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.870
I'll stand guard here.

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:24.590
Okay.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.350
Call me when she wakes up.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.560
Don't worry.

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.320
How is she?

00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.990
She's still unconscious.

00:13:36.777 --> 00:13:38.520
Did the doctor say when she'll wake up?

00:13:39.044 --> 00:13:40.590
They didn't give us a specific time,

00:13:40.688 --> 00:13:42.466
so let's go back and
interrogate Whiteboard.

00:13:43.111 --> 00:13:44.920
If we don't get anything
out of Zhou Min,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.222
given the slickster he is,
Whiteboard won't say a word.

00:13:47.222 --> 00:13:48.709
Zheng Weiwei hasn't been found yet.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.666
The longer this drags on,
the more dangerous it is.

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:51.750
How can we interrogate her

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.230
when she's still in a coma?

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.400
Besides, she's mentally fragile now.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.910
We should focus on

00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:58.066
interrogating Whiteboard now.

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:10.870
Zhou Min.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.440
You kidnapped her a month ago,

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.444
and then hid her in a house
at the city outskirts,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.888
which you led us to, ironically.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.470
She's my girlfriend.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.840
Your girlfriend?

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:22.560
You keep your girlfriend

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.080
locked inside a house?

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.622
You've never had a girlfriend, huh?

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.120
You need to keep things
thrilling, you know.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.870
She's been a naughty girl,
so she needs to be punished.

00:14:34.222 --> 00:14:35.320
Enough with the nonsense.

00:14:35.822 --> 00:14:38.222
If what you said was true,
why did you lead Xie there?

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.320
That's a good question.

00:14:41.711 --> 00:14:42.480
He's your buddy,

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.830
so you should ask him.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.510
Hey, are you a rookie cop?

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:47.510
Cut the crap.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:49.990
We have gathered sufficient
evidence of your crimes.

00:14:50.270 --> 00:14:51.670
If you come clean now

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.920
and reveal your accomplices,

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.440
you may have a chance
to lessen your sentence.

00:14:58.466 --> 00:15:01.040
Why don't you just bring her here
so she can corroborate my story?

00:15:01.577 --> 00:15:03.270
You were the one who kidnapped Zhou Min.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:04.511
What more evidence do you need?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:05.840
Bai Wentao,

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.470
you can't get away with this.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.320
Xie.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:12.830
What's your real name?

00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.280
What does it have to do with you?

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:16.390
We're now...

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:27.280
Whiteboard.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.800
We're no longer kids.

00:15:29.911 --> 00:15:31.533
Leaving this room won't be as easy

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:32.630
as how you entered.

00:15:33.422 --> 00:15:34.960
The evidence you're demanding to see

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.280
will come in time.

00:15:36.466 --> 00:15:37.750
Zhou Min is in the hospital now.

00:15:37.755 --> 00:15:39.955
Once she wakes up, she will
identify you as her abductor.

00:15:39.955 --> 00:15:40.990
You won't get away with it.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.950
Do you know who I used to be?

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:00.630
No.

00:16:01.133 --> 00:16:02.666
I used to be in the drug busting unit.

00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:04.470
All the cases I handled

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.280
were major crimes at the highest levels.

00:16:07.288 --> 00:16:09.400
I had to face real criminals,
lawless fugitives,

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.520
unlike petty crooks like you.

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:13.990
Seriously?

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.040
Of course.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.030
So, let's not waste any more time.

00:16:19.030 --> 00:16:20.280
Of course, we have the evidence.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.600
Just tell us what you did.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.520
You did something, so admit it.
Be a man.

00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:24.750
So, again,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:25.920
who else was involved?

00:16:25.977 --> 00:16:27.555
And have you kidnapped anyone else?

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.800
No.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.320
Do you know her?

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.000
Fafa.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:56.840
My daughter.

00:16:57.044 --> 00:16:58.120
You're her real father?

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.230
Absolutely real.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:00.840
Stop fooling me.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.680
I'm not.

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.560
A simple DNA test would tell.

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.550
She...

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:06.920
Fine, she's adopted.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.190
I adopted her.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:11.520
Legally adopted?

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:12.870
No.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:14.720
You may not know this,

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.520
but where I come from,

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:19.160
there are many baby girls
abandoned at birth,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.560
left on the streets just like that.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:23.110
I happened to see her there.

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.270
She was such a cute baby,

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.190
so I took her in.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:26.070
(Of course,)

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:26.960
(I know)

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.240
(that to adopt a child,)

00:17:29.466 --> 00:17:30.510
I need to be married

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:31.800
and financially stable.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.040
Me?

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.350
I'm neither of those.

00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:36.160
That's why I adopted her

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.240
without any legal papers.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.790
But I see her as my own...

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:39.630
Liar.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.510
I'm not lying.

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.350
Go on, liar.

00:17:42.777 --> 00:17:43.800
I'm not lying, really.

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:45.320
Where,

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.280
and when?

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.150
Back where I'm from.

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.630
It was...

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.520
2002.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.190
During winter,

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:56.430
around November.

00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.430
Bai Wentao,

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.670
do you actually believe your own lies?

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.550
I'm not lying.

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:05.790
This girl's name is Qiu Luoluo,

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:06.630
not Fafa.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.040
You kidnapped her.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:09.800
Qiu Luoluo?

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.800
That's a nice name.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.830
I'm giving you your final chance.

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.080
Who else have you kidnapped?

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:28.150
Just her.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.320
We've been taking care of Little Spud
since he was born.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.560
We made sure no harm came to him,
not even a bruise.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.670
He was safe with us.

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:46.280
But as soon as the other
grandmother offered to babysit,

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.960
he's gone!

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.790
That's not a fair statement!

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:50.520
Exactly.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.270
That's too hurtful.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:53.555
Besides, it was an accident.

00:18:53.555 --> 00:18:55.640
An old woman suddenly
collapsed on the streets.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.550
You expect my sister
to walk away like that?

00:18:57.550 --> 00:18:59.129
Yes, it was right for her to help,

00:18:59.130 --> 00:19:00.830
but she shouldn't have
left the baby alone!

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:02.390
You think she wanted that?

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.870
Why didn't she look after the baby?

00:19:05.511 --> 00:19:06.590
How could you blame us?

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:08.190
No one wanted this!

00:19:10.711 --> 00:19:11.480
You can't just...

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.630
Are you here to help?

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.080
If not, leave!

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.150
Look at yourselves!

00:19:18.550 --> 00:19:19.640
You made her leave!

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.670
We? We're just...

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.190
That's enough.

00:19:29.711 --> 00:19:31.111
What good does arguing bring?

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.070
You might as well

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.200
find a way to find the baby.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:36.780
(Baby Missing)

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:48.980
(Baby Missing)

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.100
(Anti-abduction Office)

00:20:42.133 --> 00:20:43.280
How's the interrogation?

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:46.720
Whiteboard is a tough nut to crack.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.240
He spent the whole night

00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.480
talking about useless gossip.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.080
Director.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.960
I'm sure Whiteboard

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.240
is just a minor leader

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.830
in the entire syndicate.

00:21:05.244 --> 00:21:06.670
Unlike Zhao Liang and Hu Xifan,

00:21:06.711 --> 00:21:08.350
Whiteboard refused
to reveal anyone else.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:09.960
They must have planned this long ago.

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.830
Unfortunately, we have no evidence now.

00:21:15.177 --> 00:21:16.480
We have. Zhou Min.

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:19.280
Given Zhou Min's current condition,

00:21:19.688 --> 00:21:21.870
she's not fit enough
to provide any information.

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.440
And Fafa's too young

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.910
to have her statement used in court.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.777
So, that leaves Whiteboard
as our only option.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:28.355
We don't have time to contend with him.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.640
Right now, we've only found Zhou Min.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.590
What about Zheng Weiwei?

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:32.430
And Little Spud?

00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:33.680
We've got no clues.

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.520
So, what now?

00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:38.870
You're asking me?

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:40.030
How would I know?

00:21:40.030 --> 00:21:40.870
I'm not the Director.

00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:53.590
Hello?

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:55.000
We've got a lead on Little Spud.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.840
Hello?

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.720
Okay, we'll head there now.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.040
Director Deng.

00:22:30.350 --> 00:22:31.350
You should take a nap.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.110
I can't.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:36.920
In our line of work,

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:38.240
we need to go with the flow

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:39.870
like him.

00:22:40.030 --> 00:22:41.350
Rest up while you can.

00:22:43.688 --> 00:22:45.870
I'll get a good night's sleep
once we find the baby.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:52.840
Mr. Yin.

00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:55.110
You think that it's unlikely

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:56.430
to find the baby, don't you?

00:22:58.270 --> 00:22:59.190
I just...

00:23:00.266 --> 00:23:01.630
don't want to be happy too soon.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:14.870
Hu.

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.950
Vice Director Yin.

00:23:19.866 --> 00:23:21.650
This is our unit's director,
Director Deng.

00:23:21.844 --> 00:23:22.560
Nice to meet you.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.600
This is Officer Hu from

00:23:23.622 --> 00:23:24.700
Nanyangdian Police Station.

00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:26.080
An auxiliary officer stationed here.

00:23:26.088 --> 00:23:27.960
Vice Director Yin,
as I told you over the phone,

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:28.800
the baby was bought

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.990
by a man called Yang Yong,
who lives on the eastern side.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.870
You should check

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:33.911
if he's the baby you're looking for.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.960
Nanyangdian Village

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.060
was notorious as
a baby-trafficking hub in the 1990s.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:39.190
The villagers here

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.755
are extremely wary of the police.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:41.870
Stay safe.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:43.280
Show us the way, then.

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.150
Here's the place.

00:23:58.680 --> 00:23:59.590
Yang Yong!

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:00.440
Are you home?

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.320
Open the gate!

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:03.150
Yang Yong!

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:06.590
Who's there?

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.720
What's with all that banging?

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.800
Did someone die?

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.110
It's you, Director.

00:24:13.911 --> 00:24:15.066
And Officer Hu, too?

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:19.360
Sir,

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:20.760
I didn't do anything illegal.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.630
Why bring the police here?

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:24.950
Here's the thing.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:26.910
The city is running

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.670
a law popularization campaign.

00:24:28.711 --> 00:24:30.066
We're here for a random check.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:35.190
Law popularization?

00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:36.430
Open the gate.

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:43.350
Have a seat.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:54.960
The police are here. Tidy up.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:56.870
Hush, baby.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:57.750
Leave it.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.510
Just go, quick!

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:00.511
(I haven't fed him yet.)

00:25:02.422 --> 00:25:03.720
How many rooms are there here?

00:25:04.955 --> 00:25:05.880
As many as you can see.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.080
How old is your kid, then?

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:08.870
I don't have kids.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.720
You don't?

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.270
Then, what's with the baby formula

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:13.110
and these toys

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.160
around your house?

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.240
Are they for you?

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.240
They're not for me.

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:22.110
So, I've been married for years,

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.280
but we haven't been
able to have a baby,

00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:26.160
so we hope to attract some luck

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.150
by placing these items

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.390
around our house.

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:30.510
If you're having such problems,

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:31.790
you should see a doctor instead.

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:33.910
I'm just following a friend's advice.

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:35.240
Have a seat, Officer.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:35.990
Come on, let's talk.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.110
Come on.

00:25:37.133 --> 00:25:39.911
So, have you learned anything from
the law popularization campaign?

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:41.480
A lot.

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:43.630
Officer?

00:25:43.688 --> 00:25:44.720
What are you looking for?

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:45.670
The toilet.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:47.520
It's not there.

00:25:47.755 --> 00:25:49.030
Fine, you should search outdoors.

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.000
There's no toilet here.

00:25:52.222 --> 00:25:53.790
The toilet's quite a distance from here.

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:54.320
It's okay.

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:55.280
He'll find it.

00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:57.270
Do you know what Articles 240-241

00:25:57.270 --> 00:25:58.960
of the Criminal Law states?

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.110
I don't.

00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:02.680
Here, let me explain.

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.000
Article 240 of the Criminal Law

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.044
of the PRC state

00:26:05.044 --> 00:26:07.020
that whoever abducts or traffics
a woman or child

00:26:07.022 --> 00:26:08.860
may be sentenced to
5-10 years of imprisonment,

00:26:08.866 --> 00:26:09.430
plus a fine.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:11.960
In severe cases,
the death penalty is also possible,

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.466
as well as confiscation of assets.

00:26:13.550 --> 00:26:14.750
I didn't do anything like that.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.000
Where's the kid from, then?

00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.430
You know,

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:19.510
buying children is also illegal.

00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:20.910
I don't know.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:05.870
You're teething, aren't you?

00:27:06.133 --> 00:27:07.960
You're itching to bite
anything you see, hmm?

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.040
Here.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:10.560
Give me that.

00:27:11.270 --> 00:27:12.110
Give me that.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:18.520
Mrs. Lin.

00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:19.440
Hello?

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.280
Yan?

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.520
Any news on Little Spud?

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.040
Right now, we're...

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:28.240
Mrs. Lin,

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:29.555
we don't have any updates now.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.390
I'll call you as soon
as there's anything.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:33.590
I'm busy now.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:37.870
Got it.

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:40.280
Call me once there's any news.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:41.866
Sure.

00:27:58.110 --> 00:27:58.950
Mr. Yin.

00:27:59.510 --> 00:28:01.000
Why did you stop me from telling her?

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:03.920
We can inform the family

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.222
once the DNA results are out.

00:28:18.133 --> 00:28:20.400
You claim you don't know
the person who sold the child.

00:28:20.511 --> 00:28:22.320
You should at least know
how he looks, then?

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.040
I really don't know.

00:28:25.550 --> 00:28:27.350
Police enforcement is strict nowadays.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.350
I didn't see him in person.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.400
If you didn't see him,

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.644
how did you receive the baby?

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.280
We...

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.190
We...

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:37.520
We were told to go...

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:38.560
Yes,

00:28:38.622 --> 00:28:39.910
the east entrance of the village.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.760
About 500 meters from there

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:43.390
is a row of willow trees.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:44.630
There was a van

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:46.280
waiting under the trees.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:47.590
A van?

00:28:48.155 --> 00:28:49.688
What does the van look like?

00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:51.150
It was

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:52.910
an ordinary van.

00:28:54.550 --> 00:28:55.560
No car plates.

00:28:56.488 --> 00:28:57.390
It looked battered.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:58.840
Very old,

00:28:58.866 --> 00:29:00.520
probably heading to the junkyard soon.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.480
(They put the baby in the van)

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.870
(for us to see.)

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.070
(The baby looked fine to us,)

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:10.190
(so as agreed, we left our payment)

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.480
(inside the van)

00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:14.760
(and took the baby with us.)

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:16.910
Then, did you see anyone

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.910
get in the van after you left?

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.790
Well, we were so nervous back then,

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.000
so we didn't look back.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.080
We didn't even notice

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.910
when the van left.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:32.066
How did you contact that guy, then?

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:39.110
My wife has a distant cousin

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:40.870
who knew we were childless.

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.320
He was doing well in Linshan,

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.120
so...

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.430
So, we asked him

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.670
to get a child for us.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.520
After that,

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.590
someone called us.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:53.840
Your cousin?

00:29:53.866 --> 00:29:54.480
What does he do?

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.230
What's his name?

00:29:55.244 --> 00:29:56.390
What does he do in the city?

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:57.830
His name is Han Yougang.

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.190
I'm not really sure

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.040
what he does for a living.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.600
Here.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.560
Come on.

00:30:10.666 --> 00:30:12.400
Tell Chief Xiao about your findings.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.560
The baby wasn't who we were looking for.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.520
We ran a DNA test,

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.790
and the baby isn't related

00:30:18.790 --> 00:30:19.777
to the victim's family.

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:22.155
We've sent the baby's blood sample
for further testing.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.520
Deng.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.720
Finding a lost child isn't easy.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:29.910
Don't feel defeated.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.320
I'm not.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.590
It's good that we rescued a child.

00:30:35.666 --> 00:30:36.910
However, we still haven't found

00:30:37.030 --> 00:30:38.755
any clues related to Little Spud's case.

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:40.430
Deng.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.350
Solving abduction cases

00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:45.350
isn't as simple as you think.

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:46.688
You need to be mentally prepared,

00:30:46.790 --> 00:30:49.080
especially when dealing
with prolonged cases.

00:30:49.333 --> 00:30:51.190
The chain of custody
is prone to breakage.

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:54.630
That's why every child saved
is a tremendous victory.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.670
The key is planning your next move

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.200
with proper deliberation.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:00.870
Right, Han?

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.320
Don't give up.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.080
I'm here if you need help.

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.110
Chief Xiao warned me

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:06.560
that if I didn't support you,

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:08.830
he'd give me a painful lesson.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.240
My dear comrade.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.240
Try relaxing your face a little.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.110
We set the date for this, didn't we?

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.870
She promised to join us for lunch today.

00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.880
She's a unit leader

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.080
at work now, after all.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:41.430
Of course, she has to focus on work.

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:43.480
I did some research

00:31:43.844 --> 00:31:45.955
about working
in the Anti-abduction Office.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.760
It's not an easy job.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.280
Yanyan is expected to work
at crime scenes in person.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.150
I can't help but worry

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:55.110
that she'd land herself in danger.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.400
You should know

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.390
how stubborn your daughter can be.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.044
You think she'd listen to you?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.320
(Actually, I know)

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:14.080
(why she insisted on joining
Anti-abduction Office.)

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.670
It's because of Lin Ran's case.

00:32:17.733 --> 00:32:20.155
It's not Yanyan's fault
that this happened, though.

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.640
They were just hanging out.

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.630
Who'd expect

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:24.280
that Lin Ran would be kidnapped?

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.280
In my opinion,

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.350
now that Yanyan is delving into this,

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:32.480
if she doesn't
get the results she wants,

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:34.590
then...

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:36.830
Looks like she hasn't moved on

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.190
from that incident after so many years.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:41.590
She's a grown-up now, though.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.150
She can think for herself.

00:32:44.790 --> 00:32:46.560
There's no need for us to worry.

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.480
Let's eat.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:18.430
Xiaoguang?

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:21.840
Xiaoguang.

00:33:22.350 --> 00:33:23.190
Xiaoguang.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.000
Xiaoguang.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:27.990
Daddy's here.

00:33:28.110 --> 00:33:28.950
Let me kiss you.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:32.750
Did I sting you

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:33.590
with my mustache?

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:34.600
Sorry.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.520
I'm sorry.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.190
Son,

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:37.190
let's go home.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:38.800
You can watch me shave,

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:40.390
okay?

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.000
Here.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:43.000
Come home with Daddy.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.520
Come on.

00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:52.150
What are you doing?

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:53.190
Let go of my son!

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.750
What are you doing?

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:55.830
Let go of my son!

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.510
Thief!

00:33:56.510 --> 00:33:57.350
Hush, baby.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.480
What were you doing?

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.280
Hush, baby.

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:02.240
I'm sorry.

00:34:02.488 --> 00:34:03.520
I mistook him for someone.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:04.680
Mistook him?

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.790
Who are you trying to fool?

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:07.240
Mistaking my child for yours?

00:34:07.422 --> 00:34:09.000
You must be one of those traffickers!

00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.190
Call the police!

00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:12.270
Now! Child trafficker,
that's what you are!

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:13.750
Hush, baby.

00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.310
I mistook him for my own child.

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:18.750
Hush, baby.

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.840
Mommy's here.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.160
I'm sorry.

00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:25.400
I mistook him for my child.

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:30.150
Is your child okay?

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:31.510
He's fine.

00:34:31.755 --> 00:34:33.080
My husband took him back home.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:34.880
Allow me to explain.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.590
He's not a child trafficker.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.920
His own child was abducted
over 10 years ago.

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.377
He's a victim himself.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.760
I apologize

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:45.920
on his behalf.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:46.670
I'm sorry

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:47.670
for causing such trouble.

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:52.600
Forget it.

00:34:52.688 --> 00:34:53.640
Let's leave it at that.

00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:54.880
I'm going home.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:55.630
Sure.

00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:57.400
I'm sorry for the trouble.

00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:08.470
Lawyer Sun.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:09.590
Wake up.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:11.240
Wake up.

00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.400
I'm looking for my son.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:23.760
His name is...

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.960
His name is Sun Xiaoguang,

00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:26.590
abducted at two years old

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:29.750
around Jinxiuyuan
at Fushan West Gardens.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.320
Drink some water.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:46.311
(People's Hospital, Nanjie District)
(After running some tests,)

00:35:46.333 --> 00:35:49.244
(we've concluded that the patient
has not been sexually assaulted.)

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:51.630
(Other than bruises on
her limbs caused by tying,)

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.560
there are no visible wounds on her body.

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:56.270
She is healthy physically,

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.990
but

00:35:58.110 --> 00:36:00.480
she has dealt with
serious emotional trauma.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.230
As requested by her parents,

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:06.670
we will keep her under observation
in the hospital for a few more days.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.790
I understand.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.710
So, she's in normal condition

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:13.230
apart from her mental trauma, then?

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:16.150
Her blood tests have revealed

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:18.230
that she has high estrogen levels.

00:36:18.510 --> 00:36:19.350
Abnormally high.

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.430
It's not a major issue, though.

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:24.040
Estrogen?

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:33.400
Careful, it's still hot.

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.590
Officer Deng.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:38.430
Come in.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.510
Have a seat.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:40.590
It's okay.

00:36:40.622 --> 00:36:41.822
I brought some flowers for Min.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.160
Thank you.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.240
They're gorgeous.

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:48.030
Officer Deng,

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.760
thank you so much for your help.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:51.600
It's okay.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.720
Min,

00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:55.270
Officer Deng is here to visit you.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.240
Greet her.

00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:58.040
Remember to thank her.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:00.110
Thank you, Officer Deng.

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:01.920
It's okay.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:03.230
We're just doing our job.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:06.910
Mrs. Zhou.

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.870
Come with me.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:23.550
Mrs. Zhou,

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.440
I'm here today

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:27.710
to ask her some details about the case.

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:30.920
We believe that there's
still another victim

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:32.377
held captive by the same syndicate.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:34.150
May I ask Min to help us?

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:35.480
Officer Deng.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:37.510
Min

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:38.880
is just beginning to recover.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.360
She's not mentally ready.

00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:43.670
Ask me anything you need to know.

00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:48.070
But we

00:37:48.222 --> 00:37:49.320
need to ask her in person

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.230
about some specific details of the case.

00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:54.400
I thought you caught
those traffickers, didn't you?

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.840
Those heartless traffickers.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:58.960
Can't you question them instead?

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:01.960
He refused to talk.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.630
If we can obtain leads

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:06.000
directly from her,

00:38:06.066 --> 00:38:08.110
we may be able to rescue
the other victims faster.

00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:10.190
He refused to talk?

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:13.190
And there's nothing else
the police can do?

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.230
Can't you just...

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:16.880
Beat him up?

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:17.670
Scold him?

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:18.960
Or torture him so he'll talk?

Mrs. Zhou. Calm down.

We cannot force a confession
out of him like that.

00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.022
And that justifies you
to torment my daughter?

That's not what I meant.

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.320
Look.

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.150
Look at my poor girl.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:31.920
Every day, when she sleeps,

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:33.840
she gets nightmares.

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:36.440
She hasn't had a good night's rest.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.480
I wish I could get inside her mind

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.230
and dig out those bad memories for her.

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.710
I'm sorry.

00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:42.630
But now,

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:43.590
you want her

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:45.590
to relive those awful memories?

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000
Don't you think that this is too cruel

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.270
for a child to bear?

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:50.790

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.840
What happened?

00:38:59.000 --> 00:38:59.840
Nothing.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.750

I've checked the phone number
that Yang Yong's wife gave.

00:41:00.688 --> 00:41:02.070
It's been suspended
due to unpaid bills,

Regardless of who and how,

00:41:32.070 --> 00:41:34.200
as long as her mother forbids,
we can't question her.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:37.000

We found some Estradiol in your house.

00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:16.600
It's used to treat

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.080
low levels of estrogen in the body.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.240

Of course, it's not for me.

Did you buy it for Zhou Min?

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:40.670
You wanted to stimulate
her sexual growth

00:42:40.711 --> 00:42:42.549
so that you could
force her into prostitution.

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:43.440
