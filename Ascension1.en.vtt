00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:05.900
Divine Grass Dew.

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.180
It acts as a deodorant.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.820
You guys can take a sniff.

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:10.260
See if you still smell.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.130
The stench on you two

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.330
wasn't sweat.

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:19.940
You guys just reeked.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.980
You two reeked of mortal stench.

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.900
Mortal stench?

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.100
Mortals consume grains.

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.820
They cannot absorb the essence of Heaven and Earth.

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.930
Instead, they gather all the impurities in their bodies.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:32.620
Of course they stink.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.450
Don't you two

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:35.820
feel any different?

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.980
Don't you guys feel spirited and refreshed?

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:42.380
Blockhead.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.620
I do think I smell nice now.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.820
My head doesn't feel heavy anymore.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.570
I suppose I feel much more better now.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.260
Brat, I could tell that you came with a motive in mind

00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:04.260
at first glance.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.460
Was it that obvious?

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:09.350
I couldn't care less about

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:10.260
that little motive of yours.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.740
I can save you or destroy you

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.930
with just a lift of my fingers.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.850
Want to give it a try?

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.100
No.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.540
He'll chase me away if I keep this up.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.260
Physician Mo, thank you for taking us in.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:34.690
You're our savior.

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.340
I promise, we'll do as you say.

00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:37.570
We won't upset you.

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:43.610
Don't be scared.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.940
I intimidated you guys

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:48.450
so that you two

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:49.610
would know

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.890
who calls the shots here.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:56.410
There are only three rules here.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:57.890
First rule,

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.540
you must be mindful of every matter

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.010
in this valley.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.730
Second rule,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.060
do not make contact with those fools outside.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.290
Third rule,

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.100
and the most important rule,

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:17.890
I'll teach you guys a mantra.

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.340
You guys have to memorize it and practice it constantly.

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.410
I'm serious.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.340
If you cannot follow these three rules,

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.540
you'd better scram

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:28.500
and don't waste my time.

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:29.890
I'll remember that.

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.220
You guys nodded without thinking, huh?

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:35.820
Very good.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.460
I'll see

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.130
how you guys will keep your promise.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.730
There are only three of us,

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.060
but we have six dishes here.

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:12.220
Physician Mo.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.250
I'm not hungry.

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:17.820
You guys can go ahead.

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.580
How could we do this?

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.770
Of course you must eat before us.

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:30.850
Sit down.

00:14:34.750 --> 00:14:35.730
Take your chopsticks.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.820
Eat up.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.180
From tomorrow onward,

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:43.820
you two will serve me.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.850
Do not make me look after you two again.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.250
What meat is this?

00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:49.300
It tastes so nice.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:50.770
That's not meat.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.220
It's Chun root.

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.300
What's that?

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.220
Is it the root of a tree?

00:14:54.630 --> 00:14:56.770
Chun wood has a firm and upright structure.

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:58.980
In traditional medicine, it is considered beneficial

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.890
for hair and skin.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.730
After it's harvested,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.730
mix with raw scallions and steam thoroughly.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.370
After steaming for half a day,

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.420
saw it into fine shreds,

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.420
hang it in the southern corner of the house

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:11.610
to dry,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.220
then drizzle with sesame oil.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.650
It can then be used as filling.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:17.060
I thought

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:19.100
tree roots were only eaten during times of famine.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:22.300
You eat to fill your tummy.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.010
I eat

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.220
to cultivate.

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:27.820
Cultivate?

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.580
You guys should rest after finishing your meal.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.490
Be sure to rise at dawn with the rooster's call,

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.100
cleanse yourself,

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.340
and light incense in preparation.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.250
Get ready to learn the mantra.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.130
What kind of mantra is it?

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.530
Why do we need to cleanse ourselves and light incense?

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.180
You still have time to prepare bathwater and cook for them?

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.460
Hurry and teach them the mantra.

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:03.980
See if they have a spirit root.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.940
Don't get me blockheads again!

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.100
Fine...

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:09.980
Go away.

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:11.490
Go away!

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:28.890
Good morning, Physician Mo.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:29.980
Time to wake up.

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.370
The sun's already high up in the sky.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.300
But we just finished cleaning ourselves up.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.180
The mantra

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:42.220
is divided into several tiers.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.770
If you guys are able

00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:45.820
to master Tier 1

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:47.650
in the next three months,

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.610
then you may formally take me as your master.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.850
After that, you guys will receive the same monthly allowance as the rest

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.100
of the members of Seven Mysteries Sect.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:57.580
There's actually money?

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:00.580
I spent a lot of effort

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:02.770
to procure this mantra.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.820
I won't let you guys off

00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:06.650
if you dare to tell anyone else about it.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.340
Understood?

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:08.650
We won't tell anyone else about it!

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:09.490
We'll never do that.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:10.580
Since you guys are illiterate,

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:13.060
just repeat what I mantra.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:15.490
Attain ultimate emptiness.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.700
Attain ultimate empathy...

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.530
This is driving me crazy.

00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:22.610
Emptiness!

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:24.130
Emptiness.

00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:25.420
Keep this up, and I'll go crazy.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.010
My goodness.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:27.980
Maintain.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.370
Maintain.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:30.530
Profound.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:31.700
Profound.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.180
Tranquility.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:34.770
Tranquility?

00:17:34.910 --> 00:17:35.490
That's your tummy.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:36.850
It's tranquility.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.370
All things

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:40.700
flourish.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.770
Flourish.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.370
And I watch their cycles of return.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.980
And I watch their cycles of return.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.300
Attain ultimate emptiness.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.460
Maintain profound tranquility...

Take off your outer shirt.

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.010
Show me how you circulate your energy.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:07.530
Useless.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.860
It's your turn.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.770
Why is his hand

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.380
like a block of ice?

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.900
It's like a dead man's hand.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.380
Attain ultimate emptiness.

00:19:27.830 --> 00:19:28.900
Maintain profound tranquility.

00:19:29.030 --> 00:19:30.140
All things flourish.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.530
And I watch their cycles of return.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:36.770

And I watch their cycles of return.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.330
That hurts!

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.050
- Be quiet. - That hurts!

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.770
- That hurts! - Be quiet.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.730
Be quiet!

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.660
This is great.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:23.220
I finally found someone who isn't a blockhead.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:25.330
This is great.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.660
Keep up this level of effort in the future too.

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:31.660
From today onward,

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.660
you are my direct disciple.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.530
Does that mean I can learn medicine

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.090
and learn how to read and write?

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.320
I'll teach you

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.250
everything you want to know.

00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:53.490
I'll give you the best

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:56.330
of everything.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:12.010
Master,

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.940
Zhang Tie spent a lot of effort practicing the mantra as well.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.660
He's the same as all of the other blockheads.

00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.220
He's useless.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.490
He wakes up earlier

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:22.460
and sleeps later than me.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:23.620
He never slacked off

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.050
when it came to practicing the mantra.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.700
Please give him another chance.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:28.490
He cannot do it.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.250
Blockheads like him won't be enlightened

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:32.530
even if you give him an eternity to practice it.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.670
Physician Mo,

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.860
don't chase me away!

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.490
I can endure hardships!

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:39.770
I can do chores!

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.240
I...

00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.730
I can grow crops!

00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:43.010
I can wash your feet on your behalf!

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.900
I...

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.770
I can also make flatbreads!

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.250
Physician Mo, I'm begging you!

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:48.380
Please don't chase me away!

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.250
Master,

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.530
if you're not willing to let Zhang Tie remain,

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.250
I shall leave together with him.

00:21:58.270 --> 00:21:58.860
Zhang Tie.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.250
Let me see

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.460
what else you can do.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.900
I do have a technique that's suitable for you.

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:45.380
It's called

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.050
Mammoth Skin.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.940
Even at the initial stage of mastery,

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.940
you'll gain the power to move mountains.

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.250
Is it that amazing? I'll do it!

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.180
However, one has to endure what other people cannot

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:01.050
in order to master the technique.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:02.730
Can you do it?

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:03.730
I can endure

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.700
all the hardships in the world

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:06.700
as long as you don't chase me away.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:10.660
Excellent.

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:12.090
Excellent.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.530
What about this?

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:16.530
Both of you can remain here.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.810
Let me guide you two

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.770
to the path of enlightenment.

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.250
Thank you, Master.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:22.770
No.

00:23:22.790 --> 00:23:23.980
Get up.

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.220
Listen.

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.250
From now on, concentrate on cultivating the mantra.

00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:29.890
You have to

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.140
monitor him all the time.

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:35.380
Do not let him slack off.

00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:39.380
Go now.

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.090
This is great.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:42.460
We can finally stay here.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.380
We're staying!

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.460
We're staying!

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:05.250
It's been so many years.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:06.920
We've finally found a mortal

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:08.700
with a spirit root!

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.180
Old Fool!

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.220
Enough already.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.290
Stop talking.

00:24:15.270 --> 00:24:16.730
I need to prepare some prescriptions for him.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.290
This won't do.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.290
This won't do.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.330
You have to follow my prescriptions.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.620
Don't use these common goods.

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:25.660
You and I cannot recover

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.250
if you let this affect his cultivation progress.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:28.660
Enough already.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.460
That's enough!

00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:32.530
I know what to do.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:40.700
That smells great.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.460
Master, we're back.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.010
Master.

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.140
What are you doing?

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:58.220
Hurry and take off your clothes.

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:00.140
I wasn't talking to you.

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.220
Han Li.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.660
Hurry and take off your clothes.

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:03.810
Come.

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:04.570
Zhang Tie.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:05.730
Come and get some water with me.

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:06.660
Yes, Master.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.490
How do you feel?

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:18.290
This is

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.700
the special herbal bath I've prepared for you.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.810
It's filled with precious herbs.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:25.380
You have to immerse yourself

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:26.460
for four hours.

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:27.940
Pay attention. It's four hours.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.940
How do you feel?

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.730
Does your body feel unblocked and transparent?

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.660
Maybe

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:45.490
a little.

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:47.860
Just a little?

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:51.570
The herbs aren't strong enough.

00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:52.900
You stingy fool!

00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:54.900
You have to include more precious herbs.

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.330
Don't be so stingy.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.490
Hurry!

00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.330
Hurry up!

00:25:58.480 --> 00:25:59.770
I've nearly given up all my treasured items

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.220
just to aid this boy in his cultivation.

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:12.980
Zhang Tie!

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:24.980
Mix it slowly.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.180
Be careful with it!

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.420
Sorry, Master.

00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.940
That's right.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:37.900
For the next four hours,

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:43.250
regulate your breathing with the mantra I taught you.

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:45.860
Come.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.180
Zhang Tie, keep an eye on it for me.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.770
Maintain

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.570
the water temperature.

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.220
Make sure it's not too high or too low.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:00.980
Attain ultimate emptiness.

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:19.720
What's wrong?

00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:21.660
I can't take this.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.460
It's so hot.

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.490
Master.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:24.150
Han Li.

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:25.250
He's unwell.

00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.920
What's wrong?

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.420
Master.

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:32.660
Please take him out of the bathtub.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:33.620
Han Li!

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:34.760
Come! Hurry!

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.140
Don't move!

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.380
Keep your composure!

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.220
Good boy.

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.980
How is it?

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:44.180
How do you feel?

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.010
It's so hot.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.380
It's so hot.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:49.050
It's very

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:49.900
hot.

00:27:52.070 --> 00:27:52.770
That's more like it.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.140
Remember the mantra I taught you.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.660
Regulate your breathing slowly.

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.220
Zhang Tie.

00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:58.290
Keep an eye on him.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.900
Give him a reminder.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.420
Attain ultimate emptiness.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.010
Maintain profound tranquility.

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.810
Shut up.

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:10.490
All things flourish.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:11.290
Shut up!

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.140
Master, he...

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.940
Recite the mantra.

00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:18.860
Attain ultimate emptiness.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.220
Attain ultimate emptiness.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:21.380
Maintain profound tranquility.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.900
Maintain...

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.730
Maintain what?

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.730
Maintain profound tranquility.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:25.900
Maintain profound tranquility!

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:27.180
All things flourish.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.090
All things flourish!

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:30.220
And I watch their cycles of return.

00:28:30.510 --> 00:28:31.570
And I watch their cycles of return.

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:32.700
Attain ultimate emptiness.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.460
Attain ultimate emptiness.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.490
Maintain profound tranquility.

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:37.810
Get down.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.420
Don't do this!

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:39.980
Attain ultimate emptiness!

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.140
Attain ultimate emptiness.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.730
Attain ultimate emptiness!

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:45.620
Maintain profound tranquility!

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:47.050
Maintain profound tranquility!

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.140
All things flourish!

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.380
All things flourish!

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:15.980
Master!

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.570
Master, what's wrong with Han Li?

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:19.250
Blockhead, wake up!

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:20.090
Blockhead!

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:20.770
Master?

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.180
Master, what's wrong with him?

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:28.330
Master?

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:33.330
Come.

00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:59.140
Blockhead, you're awake.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.050
You scared me, you know?

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:02.900
I thought you were dead!

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:04.460
Shut up!

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:06.490
Master.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.770
What's wrong with me?

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.530
You've mastered Tier 1.

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:15.140
Blockhead.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.290
Master said you've mastered Tier 1.

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.380
I suppose it'll only work with potent herbs.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.530
My dear boy.

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:26.420

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.690
will we be able to find tranquility.

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.460
Did I say something wrong?

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:35.130
From now on, you're only allowed to gather herbs.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:38.130
Do not read

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:39.420
any books again.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.170
But why?

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:44.650
Your cultivation progress

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.940
has been lagging behind for the past few months.

00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:48.340
You have to focus on your cultivation.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:49.940
Anything else other than that

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:51.570
has nothing to do with you.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.490
It's all your fault!

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.650
Who told you to let him read books?

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.090
Now, he has formed his own thoughts.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.610
How can we control him like this?

00:41:13.630 --> 00:41:14.420
Shut up!

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:17.490
Did you think he'd stay in the valley

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:19.650
and do his cultivation training

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:21.650
had I not lured him with the teaching of medicine?

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.940
You're a pathetic excuse for an immortal.

00:41:29.550 --> 00:41:32.130
You only nag people non-stop.

00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:35.980
If you're that free,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.260
you should keep a close eye on that child.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:49.860
Master kept all of his books away.

00:41:50.510 --> 00:41:51.300
He swapped them into herbs.

00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:55.820
Why did Master's moods

00:41:56.510 --> 00:41:58.050
shift so unpredictably?

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.460
It's as if he has suddenly turned into a different person.

00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.530
I have to be careful in the future.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.610
I mustn't tell people what's on my mind easily.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:29.820
I've never encountered such a situation

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:32.210
ever since I reached Tier 2 of cultivation.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.940
I have the feeling

00:42:34.510 --> 00:42:36.340
that something bad is about to happen.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:39.420
What is this?

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.980
This vial,

00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.980
why is it glowing?

00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.460
It can absorb moonlight?

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:21.940
Seems like my hypothesis was correct.

00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.860
The closed door and windows

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.820
were obstructing the vial from absorbing the light rays.

00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:28.690
The vial can absorb light rays better

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:31.130
at spacious areas with open space.

00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.860
Only then

00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:33.740
will the light orb be larger.

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:36.090
Although I don't know

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.740
where the light rays are coming from

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:40.050
or what the vial is doing

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:41.300
when it absorbs the light rays,

00:43:42.230 --> 00:43:43.530
I suppose I'm getting much closer

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:45.130
to solving the riddle.

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:48.530
But why can't I open it?

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:00.570
Why are you only here now?

00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.050
Weren't we supposed to meet on the third quarter of the Hour of Yin?

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:04.690
Li Feiyu was doing his rounds tonight.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.210
I'm lucky that I'm able to be here.

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.690
Is that a member of Wild Wolves Gang

00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:09.090
and a member of Seven Mysteries Sect?

00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:10.780
Any word

00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:11.820
on that cargo?

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:13.530
Of course.

00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:16.380
This is a birthday gift for King Qin.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:18.050
He's actually in cahoots with Wild Wolves Gang.

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:19.300
He has betrayed Seven Mysteries Sect.

00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:21.090
I have to hurry back and report this to them.

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:22.260
We'll depart in three days.

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:24.130
How much can we rob from them this time?

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:24.820
Who's there?

00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:31.010
You should return first.

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:32.570
[Wu Yan, Disciple of Seven Mysteries Sect]
Don't let people see us together.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:33.460
I'll go after him.

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.860
You run pretty fast even though you don't know martial arts.

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:01.650
Master?

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.130
I told you to focus on your cultivation in the valley.

00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:09.940
Why did you get into a fight?

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:10.690
Master.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.650
I couldn't sleep last night.

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:13.690
I went to the forest to meditate.

00:45:14.110 --> 00:45:14.940
I heard about his collusion

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:16.780
with Wild Wolves Gang by accident.

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:17.780
He has betrayed our sect!

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:19.010
Our sect?

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:20.780
Wild Wolves Gang?

00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.260
The mortals can fight and betray each other all they like.

00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:23.340
That's none of your business.

00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:25.780
Do you know that your life

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.340
is more precious than the entire Seven Mysteries Sect?

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:40.380
I won't let anyone

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.340
harm you.

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:45.090
He's a mole.

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:47.570
Did you not hear me the first time?

00:45:51.150 --> 00:45:52.210
Go back and focus on your cultivation.

00:45:53.070 --> 00:45:55.050
Reach Tier 3 as soon as possible.

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:02.650
You scoundrels

00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:05.340
have never shown me any respect.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.050
What?

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:09.740
Do you think I'm old, deaf, and blind?

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.980
Do you know who his life belongs to?

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:16.820
No one

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.090
is to lay a finger on him except for me.

00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:40.090
Han Li!

00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.820
Something bad has happened!

00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:42.010
A member of Seven Mysteries Sect

00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:43.210
fell off the valley!

00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:46.570
Master killed him.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.530
Master...

00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:59.420
Master?

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:00.570
That can't be.

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:04.490
Master just killed someone!

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.050
Master,

00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:08.530
he killed someone?

00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:22.460
Master

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.050
is actually a hidden martial arts expert.

00:47:26.320 --> 00:47:28.300
Why has he never shown his skills in front of us?

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.780
Did he hide it from us deliberately?

00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:32.690
Or...

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:44.340
How can you cultivate in peace

00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:47.530
when your heart is so restless?

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.900
You've been slacking off too much lately.

00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:54.420
It's pouring out there.

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:56.010
Sleep early.

00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:57.900
Once the weather turns better,

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.340
I'll descend the mountain to seek medicine for you.

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:02.530
Remember.

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:05.860
I'll always

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.860
keep an eye on you.
