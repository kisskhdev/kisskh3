00:00.420 --> 00:01.480
But whenever

00:02.380 --> 00:03.904
I lost my patience,

00:04.208 --> 00:06.210
perhaps that might no longer be fun for you.

00:06.970 --> 00:09.568
Based on a lot of things over the past few days,

00:10.540 --> 00:12.112
I think you’re being targeted.

00:12.130 --> 00:14.411
SHARE TRANSFER AGREEMENT
RECEIVER: BUNTHARIKA BUPPHACHINDA

00:34.120 --> 00:36.792
YOU ARE NEXT.

00:40.270 --> 00:41.656
(There’s a saying, )

00:42.270 --> 00:44.560
(people’s minds are like liquids.)

00:54.690 --> 00:57.128
(They always flow to a lower place.)

00:58.420 --> 00:59.480
(That’s why…)

01:00.380 --> 01:03.024
(many people are not afraid of going to hell.)

01:18.700 --> 01:19.888
What happened?

01:26.260 --> 01:28.272
I didn’t mean it.

01:28.304 --> 01:30.270
It is dark. I didn’t see him.

01:30.800 --> 01:31.800
Is he dead?

01:32.632 --> 01:33.976
He’s still alive.

01:47.980 --> 01:50.240
Please call an ambulance.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.408
Call now.

01:52.440 --> 01:53.440
Call an ambulance.

01:53.632 --> 01:55.664
I don’t have my phone with me.

02:07.490 --> 02:08.696
(It doesn’t matter.)

02:09.440 --> 02:11.320
(Because they were born in hell.)

02:12.800 --> 02:13.840
What do you want?

02:13.872 --> 02:14.944
I’ll ask questions.

02:14.968 --> 02:15.696
You answer.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.384
What did you do to Chatfah?

02:17.840 --> 02:19.848
Where is she?

02:20.120 --> 02:21.580
I don’t know.

02:21.620 --> 02:23.048
You must know something.

02:23.080 --> 02:25.570
I also want to know where she is.

02:26.290 --> 02:27.290
I…

02:27.570 --> 02:28.570
You what?

02:40.070 --> 02:41.070
Where are you going?

02:44.592 --> 02:46.456
(I’m not afraid of hell.)

02:46.488 --> 02:47.488
You!

02:47.780 --> 02:48.780
What’s wrong?

02:49.000 --> 02:49.936
Help.

02:49.960 --> 02:50.816
Help me.

02:50.856 --> 02:52.480
Help, a man attacked…

02:53.420 --> 02:55.184
(Because I know I’ll end up in hell.)

02:55.950 --> 02:58.768
(But I’m afraid that
I can’t pull someone down with me.)

04:11.980 --> 04:14.368
Didn’t you say you were going to bed?

04:14.576 --> 04:16.000
Where were you?

04:19.340 --> 04:21.544
My shop’s server went down.

04:21.740 --> 04:23.200
I needed to go in and check it.

04:23.970 --> 04:24.970
Where is Chom?

04:25.448 --> 04:27.450
Don’t ask me about her yet.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.280
How are you feeling?

04:29.320 --> 04:30.168
Let’s go to a hospital.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.480
I don’t need to go to a hospital.

04:31.504 --> 04:32.832
I need to go to a police station.

04:33.710 --> 04:34.944
I have something to show you.

04:43.192 --> 04:44.192
His tattoo.

04:45.570 --> 04:46.570
Isn’t it strange?

04:46.980 --> 04:49.688
We just found that
Chat was supposed to meet Mangkorn.

04:50.190 --> 04:54.192
Maybe Mangkorn means
a man with a dragon tattoo?

04:54.430 --> 04:55.430
Huh?

04:56.570 --> 04:59.344
He asked me where Chatfah is.

05:01.060 --> 05:03.592
He was supposed to meet her on that day.

05:03.624 --> 05:06.288
But she fell off the house and disappeared.

05:06.320 --> 05:07.880
He must be her attacker.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.016
I don’t know.

05:10.280 --> 05:12.696
If he is the attacker,

05:12.728 --> 05:14.264
why did he ask me about Chatfah?

05:14.280 --> 05:16.128
Shouldn’t he run away?

05:17.320 --> 05:18.320
I think…

05:18.768 --> 05:20.770
he is also looking for Chat.

05:21.980 --> 05:25.184
By pointing a knife at your throat?

05:25.200 --> 05:27.312
I think he wanted to hurt you.

05:27.584 --> 05:29.352
He is definitely the attacker.

05:44.700 --> 05:46.120
You are finally here.

05:46.152 --> 05:47.456
Where have you been?

05:47.490 --> 05:49.024
Didn’t you say you would sleep over with her?

05:49.040 --> 05:50.370
I went to find the truth.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.200
What truth?

05:55.300 --> 05:56.952
The truth that you lied to me.

06:14.376 --> 06:16.380
THE PREGNANCY TEST IS NEGATIVE.

06:16.416 --> 06:18.152
Do you think you can fool everyone?

06:18.560 --> 06:20.320
If I didn’t have connections in the hospital,

06:20.344 --> 06:21.824
I wouldn’t know the truth.

06:25.730 --> 06:28.120
No matter what Dad’s will says.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.648
All the shares I will receive from the will,

06:38.600 --> 06:40.600
I’ll give all of them to you.

06:51.460 --> 06:55.048
If you keep my pregnancy test a secret.

06:56.390 --> 06:59.432
Don’t you want the company shares?

07:04.050 --> 07:05.960
You will trade them for a man?

07:08.850 --> 07:11.520
You are trading your sister for them, too.

07:12.630 --> 07:14.576
You want to be the company’s chairman.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.984
So you agree to help me with my scheme.

07:20.260 --> 07:21.832
Don’t you think…

07:22.960 --> 07:25.752
Chom will be devastated
if she finds out the truth?

07:28.160 --> 07:30.384
We both have our reasons.

07:31.376 --> 07:33.380
I have my reasons.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.496
You have your reasons.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.776
Now, we’re both walking a tightrope.

07:49.180 --> 07:50.576
You lied to me.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.408
You lied to Nathat.

07:56.100 --> 07:57.552
You lied to all of us.

08:00.940 --> 08:02.176
For money?

08:04.456 --> 08:05.456
Chom.

08:10.616 --> 08:12.620
I’m doing everything for our family.

08:14.790 --> 08:17.312
I need to hold as many shares as possible.

08:17.768 --> 08:20.168
Uncle Kajorn has a lot of influence
over the executive board.

08:20.970 --> 08:24.504
If I didn’t do anything, our family
would lose its power in the company.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.856
You did that for our family?

08:28.780 --> 08:31.192
B*tch, you did it for your benefits.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.968
Don’t try to make yourself look good.

08:36.880 --> 08:40.552
When you tell everyone
that you did it for our family,

08:40.592 --> 08:42.928
does it make you feel better?

08:44.930 --> 08:46.320
I don’t get it.

08:47.584 --> 08:49.580
Don’t you feel anything?

08:51.090 --> 08:52.768
When you see me sad.

08:55.860 --> 08:56.860
Huh?

08:57.600 --> 08:59.384
You betrayed me.

09:01.160 --> 09:04.336
You ruined Nathat’s life and mine.

09:07.880 --> 09:08.880
I…

09:09.980 --> 09:15.000
I have to watch the man I love
marrying my sister.

09:16.910 --> 09:19.230
Have you ever thought about
how painful it would be for me?

09:21.780 --> 09:23.192
Have you ever thought about that?

09:25.090 --> 09:26.090
Bua.

09:29.370 --> 09:30.370
Is it true?

09:42.530 --> 09:43.656
So what?

09:49.660 --> 09:51.384
Even if I didn’t do that,

09:52.290 --> 09:53.944
it wouldn’t change anything.

09:55.080 --> 09:56.368
What the hell do you mean?

09:57.970 --> 09:59.544
I wouldn’t change the fact that…

10:02.010 --> 10:03.832
Nathat slept with Chat.

10:07.250 --> 10:10.720
Whether she was pregnant or not,

10:11.110 --> 10:13.872
They both had betrayed you.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.520
So you…

10:27.220 --> 10:28.384
you had to do that?

10:31.250 --> 10:32.544
You had to betray me, too?

10:39.910 --> 10:42.864
You thought I would be hurt by it anyway.

10:44.050 --> 10:47.952
So you chose to earn benefits from my loss?

10:50.176 --> 10:52.180
You don’t understand you.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.800
Didn’t you say we are sisters?

10:57.904 --> 11:00.424
How could you do this to your sister?

11:17.360 --> 11:19.664
Because you never understand me.

11:20.820 --> 11:21.820
What?

11:22.616 --> 11:24.620
You never understand anything.

11:26.490 --> 11:29.216
You never know how I feel…

11:29.700 --> 11:31.312
and what I’ve been through.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.240
I’m the oldest sister.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.016
What kind of pressure I need to endure.

11:40.380 --> 11:42.232
When you left the house,

11:43.340 --> 11:45.416
I had to carry our family’s hopes.

11:45.440 --> 11:47.420
I had to be the head of the family.

11:48.170 --> 11:51.176
I had to manage everything that Dad left.

11:52.660 --> 11:54.136
While you…

11:54.160 --> 11:55.472
and you,

11:56.990 --> 12:00.120
You went out to live your life
and pursue your dream.

12:00.144 --> 12:01.584
What about me?

12:02.430 --> 12:04.472
Have you ever thought of me?

12:04.504 --> 12:07.010
So this is my fault?

12:09.220 --> 12:11.672
Did you hear what you said?

12:12.930 --> 12:16.064
Did you punish me
for everything you went through?

12:18.300 --> 12:20.376
Why did you make me pay for it?

12:22.300 --> 12:25.752
No, I don’t understand you.

12:26.090 --> 12:28.040
I will never understand it.

12:28.072 --> 12:31.072
You said you did it for our family.

12:31.096 --> 12:33.430
Am I not your family?

12:37.970 --> 12:40.768
Have you ever seen me as your sister?

13:03.140 --> 13:04.776
Don’t worry, Bua.

13:06.230 --> 13:08.920
Don’t worry that
Dad would be disappointed in you.

13:10.130 --> 13:13.184
I know he would be very proud of you.

13:13.216 --> 13:15.352
Because you’re so damn much like him.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.472
I think he is giving you a big hand from hell.

14:28.384 --> 14:29.440
Chom.

14:29.464 --> 14:30.464
Chom.

14:31.660 --> 14:33.420
Please go back and talk things out with her.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.384
At this point,
what do we have left to talk about?

14:39.840 --> 14:40.768
Chom.

14:40.816 --> 14:43.120
It might be a misunderstanding.

14:46.070 --> 14:48.432
Do you know what Chat said to me?

14:50.850 --> 14:52.768
She said she didn’t do anything.

14:54.410 --> 14:59.184
We fell into the trap of our own demons.

15:00.380 --> 15:01.928
Then we blamed her for it.

15:05.980 --> 15:08.360
Because we were afraid
to admit our wrongdoings.

15:30.740 --> 15:31.740
Pi.

15:38.510 --> 15:40.744
I won’t ask you to understand me.

15:41.480 --> 15:44.776
I know I did a horrible thing.

15:48.100 --> 15:50.032
No matter what I say,

15:51.180 --> 15:52.552
it will sound like an excuse.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.824
Tell me what you have to say.

15:58.300 --> 16:02.024
Then I’ll decide if I can understand you or not.

16:08.970 --> 16:10.384
Do you understand me?

16:12.310 --> 16:14.376
I did it for our family.

16:16.150 --> 16:17.944
Even if it means you had to hurt Chom,

16:19.370 --> 16:20.370
you still chose to do it?

16:24.144 --> 16:26.140
I always thought…

16:27.820 --> 16:29.736
you did everything for our family.

16:32.030 --> 16:33.712
But now I don’t get it.

16:34.580 --> 16:36.216
I don’t know anymore,

16:38.220 --> 16:40.736
when you say our family,

16:41.960 --> 16:44.160
does it still include Choom and me?

16:47.510 --> 16:49.160
Or does it mean you only?

17:28.580 --> 17:29.580
Chom.

17:34.550 --> 17:35.550
Nathat.

17:36.730 --> 17:37.730
I…

17:38.730 --> 17:39.856
I…

18:27.060 --> 18:28.624
I’m sorry, Miss Baibua.

18:28.656 --> 18:30.184
I’ll come back later.

18:30.216 --> 18:31.736
It’s okay.

18:32.250 --> 18:33.250
Come in.

18:34.370 --> 18:35.370
Yes.

18:36.460 --> 18:37.460
What?

18:38.120 --> 18:41.792
I got the file from the CCTV at the farm.

18:41.808 --> 18:45.368
Now, I know why the ground at the farm
looks like it was recently dug.

18:57.808 --> 19:00.216
The video is not sharp.

19:00.240 --> 19:04.088
But it shows that someone walked into the area.

19:04.820 --> 19:05.984
It’s him again?

19:08.600 --> 19:10.328
Call the police and tell them

19:10.360 --> 19:11.984
we will send the file to them.

19:12.430 --> 19:13.430
Yes.

19:15.600 --> 19:16.776
Dig the whole area.

19:20.780 --> 19:22.168
Captain, I found something.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.456
You found it?

19:25.410 --> 19:26.410
Yes.

19:26.504 --> 19:27.704
There’s something in the well.

19:28.540 --> 19:30.296
I think this case is no longer easy.

19:31.450 --> 19:33.016
Some of them are lying.

19:35.020 --> 19:36.360
Maybe all of them.

19:49.570 --> 19:50.570
What’s up?

19:51.870 --> 19:53.448
I have something to tell you.

20:14.100 --> 20:17.024
Can you come to meet me?

20:17.790 --> 20:18.790
I…

20:20.180 --> 20:21.792
I don’t think I can meet you right now.

20:22.008 --> 20:23.432
Captain, I found it.

20:36.220 --> 20:37.408
Are you leaving now?

20:37.688 --> 20:38.848
I should leave.

20:39.370 --> 20:40.768
Before someone sees me.

20:43.420 --> 20:46.552
Do we need to hide our relationship like this?

20:48.850 --> 20:50.392
You know why.

20:52.624 --> 20:54.620
No one can see us together.

20:55.620 --> 20:56.976
Things have changed.

21:03.850 --> 21:05.552
Things can be changed again, right?

21:08.990 --> 21:11.048
I’ll tell the police the truth

21:11.370 --> 21:13.152
about what happened that night.

21:14.860 --> 21:16.776
So you won’t need Thana’s help anymore.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.440
Nathat.

21:27.704 --> 21:29.700
Thana helped you fake your alibi.

21:30.740 --> 21:32.336
Why did he do that?

21:38.928 --> 21:40.168
It was nothing.

21:42.984 --> 21:44.144
I don’t believe you.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.296
Even if I ask you again,

21:47.320 --> 21:49.176
you won’t tell me anyway.

21:50.560 --> 21:54.416
That’s why I want to tell the truth
to the police and everyone.

21:56.350 --> 21:57.560
I love you, Chom.

21:59.420 --> 22:01.648
Even though the whole nation will hate me,

22:02.030 --> 22:03.030
I don’t care.

22:04.540 --> 22:05.976
I want to be with you.

22:06.580 --> 22:08.360
I want to live a happy life with you.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I won’t hurt you again.

22:25.500 --> 22:27.184
A medical examiner is on his way.

22:29.180 --> 22:31.016
The case is getting complicated.

22:31.800 --> 22:34.360
From a missing person case,
it has now turned into a murder case.

22:39.190 --> 22:40.304
You can’t go in.

22:40.344 --> 22:41.584
Only police officers are allowed to go in.

22:41.600 --> 22:43.056
Move. This is my sister.

22:43.088 --> 22:44.096
Police are investigating the scene.

22:44.120 --> 22:45.120
You can’t go in.

22:46.976 --> 22:47.976
Come in.

22:50.230 --> 22:51.230
Wait.

22:57.310 --> 22:58.400
Don’t tell me…

22:58.740 --> 22:59.504
that’s Chatfah?

22:59.520 --> 23:00.520
No.

23:03.670 --> 23:05.328
If only bones are left like this,

23:05.990 --> 23:07.656
it takes around a year and a half.

23:09.960 --> 23:11.032
So…

23:12.140 --> 23:14.328
I think this is not your sister.

23:19.520 --> 23:20.792
Then who is this?

24:59.090 --> 25:00.090
Hello.

25:00.510 --> 25:01.792
You came to pick up the painting?

25:01.816 --> 25:03.560
Wait a minute. I’ll be right there.

25:16.130 --> 25:17.130
Chom.

25:17.350 --> 25:18.624
Why are you late?

25:18.784 --> 25:19.536
Sorry.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.176
My errand took longer than I thought.

25:26.180 --> 25:27.180
Are you ready?

25:29.500 --> 25:30.500
Yes.

25:31.620 --> 25:32.820
If you are ready, let’s go in.

25:39.730 --> 25:42.928
GRANDMA

25:45.128 --> 25:47.130
We came to give an additional statement.

25:47.560 --> 25:48.560
Sure.

25:50.610 --> 25:51.848
The truth is…

25:53.560 --> 25:54.576
That night.

25:55.330 --> 25:56.768
At Bupphachat Mansion.

26:02.370 --> 26:03.370
I…

26:03.880 --> 26:05.640
I went there to meet Chatfah.

26:08.230 --> 26:10.560
I knew that
their father’s will was disclosed on that day.

26:10.940 --> 26:12.512
I was worried about her.

26:13.140 --> 26:14.672
I couldn’t reach her on the phone.

26:16.410 --> 26:17.976
So I called Chompoo.

26:21.728 --> 26:23.296
I was in front of the house.

26:23.696 --> 26:25.700
But I decided not to go in.

26:26.150 --> 26:30.264
I didn’t want to give anyone the wrong idea
if they saw me with Chompoo.

26:36.450 --> 26:38.352
I came to give my statement.

26:38.368 --> 26:42.312
Because I heard that you are checking
phone records on that night.

26:43.980 --> 26:45.904
I don’t want to become a suspect.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.200
So I came to tell you the truth.

26:55.300 --> 26:56.300
Here.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.296
All the evidence.

27:03.536 --> 27:05.540
I affirm that…

27:07.540 --> 27:09.184
to me, Chompoo…

27:11.000 --> 27:13.624
she is just my fiancée’s sister.

27:21.190 --> 27:25.576
He sneaked in to dig the ground in our farm?

27:26.600 --> 27:28.424
So the ground would look soft.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.000
The police would get suspicious.

27:31.568 --> 27:36.256
Did he know that a body was buried there?

27:39.560 --> 27:40.760
Who is he?

27:42.120 --> 27:43.120
Chom.

27:51.580 --> 27:52.776
How can you do this to me?

27:54.460 --> 27:56.384
This is not what we agreed on.

27:57.340 --> 27:59.000
This is for the best,

28:00.430 --> 28:01.808
for you and me.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.440
For the best? What does it mean?

28:05.620 --> 28:06.728
Trust me.

28:08.632 --> 28:10.760
Because I trusted you.

28:11.100 --> 28:12.620
That’s why things turned out this way.

28:14.920 --> 28:15.920
Chom.

28:16.840 --> 28:17.984
I’m sorry.

28:18.710 --> 28:19.984
You’re sorry?

28:21.380 --> 28:24.576
Next time, if you can keep your promise,

28:24.608 --> 28:26.088
then don’t say it.

28:29.340 --> 28:30.472
I’m sorry.

28:32.230 --> 28:33.576
I’m really sorry.

28:34.500 --> 28:35.552
From now on,

28:36.340 --> 28:37.904
the only person I will trust,

28:39.500 --> 28:40.968
it’s me.

28:59.240 --> 29:00.968
Do you really think I don’t know

29:01.000 --> 29:02.970
what you did behind my back?

29:03.760 --> 29:08.256
I assigned you to manage everything for me because you’re my daughter-in-law.

29:08.296 --> 29:10.384
But it doesn’t mean that I won’t check it.

29:10.632 --> 29:12.630
I know you did me dirty.

29:15.760 --> 29:20.272
You secretly sold several pieces of land I owned.

29:22.184 --> 29:23.352
From now on,

29:23.950 --> 29:26.816
Everything that you used to have
will be taken away

29:26.848 --> 29:28.328
Just like your future.

29:28.560 --> 29:31.704
Mother, please don’t do that.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.904
You can’t even raise your son well.

29:35.330 --> 29:38.280
If you threaten my mom
because I want to get back with Chompoo,

29:39.200 --> 29:40.792
I want to tell you this.

29:41.560 --> 29:43.464
This has nothing to do with my mom.

29:43.980 --> 29:45.576
It was all my fault.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.560
I just wanted to fix it.

29:49.180 --> 29:52.000
By making things worse?

29:53.450 --> 29:57.192
If you want to choose that woman
over your family, you can do that.

29:57.770 --> 29:59.936
But don’t drag me into this mess.

30:01.290 --> 30:04.392
I spent decades
building my reputation in the business.

30:04.810 --> 30:09.328
I will never let my loser grandson ruin it.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.720
Mother.

30:11.180 --> 30:12.680
Mother.

30:12.710 --> 30:15.336
Nathat, come and beg her.

30:15.376 --> 30:16.376
Nathat.

30:17.930 --> 30:22.248
Promise her
that you will stay away from that family.

30:29.100 --> 30:30.168
Hello.

30:30.792 --> 30:32.790
(Did you take care of everything?)

30:34.790 --> 30:37.408
Did you hear what happened on our farm?

30:38.490 --> 30:39.608
I heard that…

30:40.350 --> 30:42.520
the police found a body on our farm.

30:55.650 --> 30:57.104
Why do you think…

30:58.500 --> 30:59.864
I know anything about it?

31:02.230 --> 31:04.968
Is it because I often visit the farm?

31:06.380 --> 31:08.272
It could be one of the workers,

31:08.730 --> 31:10.784
or someone who sneaked into our farm.

31:10.816 --> 31:12.416
But in our farm,

31:12.640 --> 31:15.440
CCTV cameras have been installed
for more than ten years.

31:18.816 --> 31:20.820
It’s just my speculation.

31:21.380 --> 31:27.336
The body might have been there
before the cameras were installed,

31:28.860 --> 31:31.024
or since I was young.

31:32.480 --> 31:33.480
Bua.

31:34.520 --> 31:36.568
What you need to focus on right now

31:37.072 --> 31:39.070
is the company’s stability.

31:39.580 --> 31:40.768
About the investigation,

31:41.896 --> 31:43.900
let the police do their job.

31:46.240 --> 31:47.368
That’s right.

31:48.350 --> 31:50.376
That area used to be a well.

31:50.416 --> 31:54.928
It was buried
because you installed a new water system.

31:55.530 --> 31:56.530
Am I right?

31:58.120 --> 32:01.160
I just ask you the question
that the police will have.

32:01.570 --> 32:04.456
So you will have time to prepare your answer,

32:04.984 --> 32:06.980
when you are interrogated.

32:12.740 --> 32:13.912
You mom.

32:14.280 --> 32:16.392
She told you a lot about me.

32:16.810 --> 32:18.400
Did she tell you this?

32:18.990 --> 32:21.472
If something happens to me,

32:22.340 --> 32:24.880
You and your sisters won’t get off the hook either.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.152
The body that they found,

32:33.110 --> 32:35.624
it might not be the only secret in our family.

32:36.580 --> 32:38.168
The well is discovered.

32:38.770 --> 32:39.770
Do you think…

32:40.140 --> 32:42.520
that you won’t be dragged into it?

32:45.672 --> 32:47.104
Do you know…

32:47.850 --> 32:50.224
why I do the plant trimming by myself?

32:52.560 --> 32:55.120
If we don’t trim rotten branches,

32:55.700 --> 32:57.344
it will slow down the plant’s growth.

32:59.130 --> 33:02.360
The sooner we can get rid of the rotten branches,

33:03.520 --> 33:05.520
the plant will not only look pretty,

33:06.940 --> 33:09.056
but it will also grow faster.

33:13.190 --> 33:14.728
The person who taught me this,

33:16.050 --> 33:17.456
it’s your father.

33:20.250 --> 33:21.696
Now you can see, right?

33:22.290 --> 33:23.960
In your father’s eyes,

33:24.870 --> 33:26.736
who were the rotten branches.

33:44.140 --> 33:45.904
That’s the brat I told you about.

33:46.624 --> 33:48.400
That brat who hit you the other day?

33:49.140 --> 33:50.584
I was the one who hit her.

33:50.888 --> 33:52.890
That’s not what I heard.

33:53.780 --> 33:54.780
Stop it.

33:55.380 --> 33:56.380
Damn.

33:56.544 --> 33:58.088
I hate her so much.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.224
I want to hit her again.

34:00.248 --> 34:01.248
How about this?

34:01.640 --> 34:02.640
I have a plan.

34:13.170 --> 34:14.624
Can I sit with you?

34:15.780 --> 34:16.780
No.

34:16.816 --> 34:17.944
I’m waiting for my friends.

34:18.200 --> 34:20.640
But I’ve seen you sitting alone for some time.

34:20.680 --> 34:22.640
Your friends probably stood you up.

34:22.664 --> 34:24.944
Why don’t you let us join you?

34:25.056 --> 34:26.456
I want to be alone.

34:27.032 --> 34:28.460
I see.

34:31.790 --> 34:33.128
What are you doing?

34:37.710 --> 34:38.830
What the hell are you doing?

34:39.770 --> 34:40.770
Calm down.

34:41.240 --> 34:42.352
I’m just joking.

34:42.376 --> 34:43.120
It’s not a big deal.

34:43.144 --> 34:43.864
Go away.

34:43.880 --> 34:44.880
Leave me alone.

34:45.020 --> 34:45.752
Fine.

34:45.912 --> 34:46.904
If that’s what you want.

34:46.936 --> 34:49.217
You think you can play hard to get
because you are pretty?

34:49.500 --> 34:50.500
Let’s go.

35:21.130 --> 35:22.344
Chom.

35:22.360 --> 35:23.416
Run.

35:41.420 --> 35:42.816
Hi, Chompoo.

35:44.010 --> 35:45.010
Sarah.

35:45.930 --> 35:47.032
What are you doing here?

35:47.460 --> 35:49.192
I have a gift for you.

35:49.540 --> 35:51.920
I guarantee you will love it.

35:52.208 --> 35:55.568
Because it’s just like in your video.

35:55.930 --> 35:57.048
What the hell do you mean?

35:59.224 --> 36:00.816
You should come with me.

36:03.140 --> 36:04.140
Hey.

36:04.700 --> 36:05.700
Let me go.

36:10.090 --> 36:11.090
Come here.

36:12.890 --> 36:13.890
Let me go.

36:17.810 --> 36:18.810
Let me go.

36:20.140 --> 36:21.192
Let me go.

36:21.224 --> 36:22.728
It’s just a joke.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.160
I watched your video.

36:24.192 --> 36:26.160
I know what you like.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.992
I don’t like you, douchebag.

36:31.590 --> 36:32.848
Let me go.

36:33.096 --> 36:34.768
Why don’t you tell me you like it rough?

36:43.220 --> 36:44.792
Stop playing hard to get.

36:45.020 --> 36:46.368
I know you are easy.

36:46.416 --> 36:47.928
Tomorrow, when you see the video,

36:47.968 --> 36:49.392
you will thank me.

36:51.390 --> 36:52.872
You, jerks.

36:53.370 --> 36:54.370
Get off me.

37:11.860 --> 37:13.860
Are you going to let yourself
be beaten down again?

37:15.140 --> 37:17.552
Are you going to continue to be a victim?

37:18.344 --> 37:20.340
I’m jealous of you.

37:20.690 --> 37:22.448
It’s not because of Nathat.

37:23.130 --> 37:24.880
It’s not because you’re pretty.

37:25.740 --> 37:28.760
It’s because among us,
you have the strongest fighting spirit.

37:30.380 --> 37:32.624
You are the person I look up to the most.

37:38.620 --> 37:41.600
TO MY SISTER, YOU’RE THE MOST RESILIENT,
THE BEST AND THE STRONGEST.

38:14.620 --> 38:15.620
My phone.

38:17.456 --> 38:19.152
Don’t step over someone when they’re down.

38:20.890 --> 38:22.488
We should beat them up instead.

39:08.352 --> 39:09.960
I shouldn’t come here.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.512
But you came.

39:15.110 --> 39:16.768
That’s because you said…

39:17.690 --> 39:19.856
you have useful information for the investigation.

39:22.210 --> 39:24.208
You know this is dangerous.

39:28.530 --> 39:29.810
What do you want for your drink?

39:35.070 --> 39:36.872
I came here for work.

39:37.740 --> 39:39.448
I don’t drink while I’m working.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.608
Then I’ll drink for you.

40:01.780 --> 40:03.184
Do you remember?

40:04.000 --> 40:06.952
I told you about the dream I had
when I almost got hit by a truck.

40:08.220 --> 40:10.760
It’s the dream I forgot for a long time.

40:11.990 --> 40:16.576
I always thought
it was a scene from a movie I saw.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.184
Or it was just my imagination.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.576
Help.

40:20.624 --> 40:22.580
Pi, help me.

40:24.940 --> 40:26.208
I curse you.

40:26.550 --> 40:29.816
You all will burn in hell.

40:30.300 --> 40:33.144
I repeatedly had this dream.

40:34.860 --> 40:36.592
I remember every word,

40:37.140 --> 40:38.584
those vulgar words.

40:38.940 --> 40:40.312
The curse,

40:40.820 --> 40:43.096
that my family will all burn in hell.

40:47.840 --> 40:49.144
You know it, right?

40:49.700 --> 40:51.912
I can’t use your dream as evidence.

41:02.392 --> 41:04.390
It might not be just a dream.

41:07.630 --> 41:10.640
It might be something that I witnessed.

41:18.672 --> 41:20.008
Chom.

41:20.650 --> 41:21.792
What are you doing here?

41:26.100 --> 41:27.100
Hold on.

41:28.150 --> 41:31.088
You are drunk.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.540
You’ve had a crush on Chat for all this time.

41:36.580 --> 41:38.368
Let’s think that I were Chat.

41:40.632 --> 41:42.520
Can you help me forget everything?

41:53.248 --> 41:56.920
(My sister probably doesn’t go anywhere.)

41:59.380 --> 42:03.880
(Her existence has clearly been on our minds.)

42:07.880 --> 42:10.888
(She blends in to be a part of our minds.)

42:12.720 --> 42:14.720
(We now can’t tell…)

42:15.560 --> 42:18.608
(who is the real demon here.)

42:29.030 --> 42:30.304
(Who knows?)

42:31.240 --> 42:33.240
(The world we are living in right now, )

42:33.710 --> 42:35.448
(it’s hell...)

42:36.370 --> 42:37.536
(from the beginning.)

42:44.550 --> 42:45.552
What are you doing?

42:45.830 --> 42:48.832
I always thought you had a crush on Chatfah.

42:49.250 --> 42:51.408
You are the only one I can talk to.

42:51.432 --> 42:53.552
Because you are the only one I can trust.

42:53.576 --> 42:54.664
Are you saying

42:54.700 --> 42:57.584
Bua killed Uncle Kajorn and ran away?

42:57.700 --> 43:00.464
On the night that Chatfah fell down,

43:00.504 --> 43:03.344
she asked us who killed our mom?
