WEBVTT

00:01:12.782 --> 00:01:13.783
Seong-A.

00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:15.826
My eyes…

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:18.746
have opened.

00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:25.544
If my ears, eyes, mouth,
and nose are taken over by ghosts,

00:01:26.212 --> 00:01:27.505
what happens then?

00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:34.094
Your ears.

00:01:34.178 --> 00:01:36.722
Once you hear something,
you become likely to believe it.

00:01:36.806 --> 00:01:38.933
You'll end up believing ghosts.

00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:43.020
Your eyes.

00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:46.106
Seeing ghosts makes you lonely.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.777
When you say you see ghosts,
people think you're lying.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.779
No one believes you.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.159
That's why you become lonely.

00:01:58.035 --> 00:01:59.203
Yeah.

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:03.207
Some feel so lonely
that they want to befriend ghosts.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.708
But you shouldn't.

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:08.963
There's usually only one reason
why ghosts would befriend a human.

00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:11.882
It's to take over their body.

00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:15.970
Is there something on my face?

00:02:18.472 --> 00:02:19.473
No.

00:02:19.974 --> 00:02:21.350
I stared because you're pretty.

00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:34.321
Do you know you're really weird, sir?

00:02:35.072 --> 00:02:36.866
-Why do you say that?
-I mean…

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:39.785
Who lets a novice like me
enter a major competition like this?

00:02:40.452 --> 00:02:41.662
Aren't you afraid?

00:02:41.745 --> 00:02:43.372
I feel pretty intimidated right now.

00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:45.916
This feels pretty professional.

00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:48.002
I don't expect you to win a medal.

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:50.337
Do what you always do at school.

00:02:50.838 --> 00:02:51.964
I don't do anything, though.

00:02:52.047 --> 00:02:53.632
I just have fun in the field.

00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:55.175
That's what I meant.

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:56.886
Fiddle with your bow next to Gyeon-U.

00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:58.429
I don't think you realized,

00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:01.140
but Gyeon-U sometimes smiles
because of you.

00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:04.351
Those who smile have a longer career,
and that's what I want for him.

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:13.235
So you're using me
so Gyeon-U can do better?

00:03:13.736 --> 00:03:15.279
-I love you.
-Buy me beef.

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:16.405
If Gyeon-U wins gold.

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:17.948
-Deal.
-Deal.

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:47.853
What are you doing?

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.079
I can't believe I'm seeing you here.
I thought you'd quit archery.

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:10.042
Yes. I'm back.

00:04:10.125 --> 00:04:12.252
JOONGHYUN HIGH SCHOOL

00:04:12.336 --> 00:04:13.337
Does Hui-na know

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.005
you got back into archery?

00:04:16.507 --> 00:04:17.591
Yeah, she does.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:19.760
Did she forgive you?

00:04:21.804 --> 00:04:22.805
Hui-na.

00:04:23.764 --> 00:04:25.265
I'm entering the Hanragi Competition.

00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:27.726
I've decided to stop running away.

00:04:28.686 --> 00:04:29.853
Gyeon-U.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:31.897
I still feel the same.

00:04:32.481 --> 00:04:34.024
I want you to die.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:39.655
I hope you'll get better.

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:45.911
How could you do this to Hui-na?
She ended up like that because of you!

00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:47.746
People might see. Stop it.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.456
I know you're upset, but talk it out.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.418
I thought it was my fault too.

00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:57.006
That's why I walked out of her life,

00:04:58.048 --> 00:04:59.842
but she's still not happy at all.

00:05:10.519 --> 00:05:13.564
I don't do archery
to make someone unhappy.

00:05:14.523 --> 00:05:16.525
I do it because I like it.

00:05:21.447 --> 00:05:23.615
Let's not make things complicated

00:05:24.116 --> 00:05:25.951
and just do what we like instead.

00:05:27.036 --> 00:05:28.746
We all like archery.

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.842
The energy of the heavens, earth, sun,
and moon will bring silence and light.

00:05:42.718 --> 00:05:47.181
May my spirit become one with the ghost's
and may our wills become one.

00:05:47.264 --> 00:05:49.641
The energy of the heavens,
earth, sun, and moon…

00:05:49.725 --> 00:05:52.227
Why does she need the Unify Spell now?

00:05:52.311 --> 00:05:54.980
…and may our wills become one.

00:05:55.064 --> 00:05:56.732
May it be done immediately…

00:05:59.401 --> 00:06:00.611
Yeomhwa.

00:06:00.694 --> 00:06:01.987
Open up!

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.327
Ma'am.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.037
Get the prayer room key.

00:06:16.877 --> 00:06:19.046
What the heck is she up to now?

00:06:22.758 --> 00:06:23.759
HWAMOK HIGH SCHOOL

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:26.970
We'll now begin
the high school men's 70 m competition.

00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:31.016
Gyeon-U.

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.726
If you're ready, head on out.

00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:46.115
Good luck, Gyeon-U!

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.703
Stay strong, Gyeon-U. You've got this.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.562
When we hold hands tight like this,

00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:17.813
then…

00:07:18.564 --> 00:07:20.482
it keeps me from thinking
that I might lose.

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:22.860
Because you're so warm.

00:07:26.947 --> 00:07:29.449
Now, it's my turn to protect you.

00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:00.439
Oh, two points?

00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:12.367
That's it.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.040
He's so cool.

00:08:21.752 --> 00:08:23.337
Oh, my dear Gyeon-U.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.339
He's so handsome even from behind.

00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:26.882
What a cutie.

00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:36.975
GO, HWAMOK HIGH!

00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:42.105
May my spirit become one with the ghost's
and may our wills become one.

00:08:42.189 --> 00:08:46.777
May my spirit become one with the ghost's
and may our wills become one.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.656
May my spirit become one with the ghost's
and may our wills become one.

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:55.744
May my spirit become one with the ghost's
and may our wills become one.

00:08:55.827 --> 00:09:00.415
May my spirit become one with the ghost's
and may our wills become one.

00:09:00.499 --> 00:09:03.418
May my spirit become one with the ghost's
and may our wills become one…

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:06.004
-I recognize this…
-…will bring silence and light.

00:09:06.088 --> 00:09:09.424
May my spirit become one with the ghost's
and may our wills become one.

00:09:37.244 --> 00:09:39.329
You're sending negative energy

00:09:39.413 --> 00:09:41.415
to make it easier
for Bong-su to kill Gyeon-U.

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:42.833
Too bad, though.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:47.462
Today, we used the Suppress Technique
to protect each other.

00:09:48.547 --> 00:09:52.092
If you want to harm Gyeon-U,
you must go through me first.

00:09:54.386 --> 00:09:57.848
The energy of the heavens, earth, sun,
and moon will bring silence and light.

00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:01.184
-May my spirit become one…
-May my spirit become one with his

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:03.395
and may our wills become one.

00:10:03.478 --> 00:10:04.980
May it be done immediately.

00:10:06.732 --> 00:10:08.025
You sly thing.

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.165
The energy of the heavens,
earth, sun, and moon…

00:10:23.248 --> 00:10:24.583
The energy of the heavens,
earth, sun, and moon…

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:26.084
May my spirit become one with his

00:10:26.168 --> 00:10:27.461
and may our wills become one.

00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:39.431
…and may our wills become one.

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:40.849
…and may our wills become one.

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:43.602
…and may our wills become one.
May it be done immediately.

00:11:00.827 --> 00:11:02.454
ROUND 1

00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:04.539
You'll be disqualified
if you don't shoot now, Gyeon-U.

00:11:04.623 --> 00:11:06.083
Shoot now, Gyeon-U Gyeon-U.

00:11:09.628 --> 00:11:12.589
May my spirit become one with the ghost's
and may our wills become one.

00:11:14.383 --> 00:11:15.801
About archery.

00:11:15.884 --> 00:11:17.010
How does it make you feel?

00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:18.804
I feel good.

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.514
However strong the wind blows…

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:23.683
I can beat it with a single arrow.

00:11:41.868 --> 00:11:42.994
Oh, my gosh.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.259
First place
in high school men's individual event.

00:11:57.342 --> 00:11:58.885
Bae Gyeon-U.

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:08.770
Well done!

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:19.197
Congratulations, Gyeon-U.

00:12:19.281 --> 00:12:20.407
Well done.

00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:30.333
I'm proud of you!

00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:31.501
So cool!

00:12:37.883 --> 00:12:39.801
One, two, three.

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:42.137
Bigger smiles, everyone.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.889
-One, two, three.
-Even bigger?

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:47.350
…two, three. Okay.

00:12:49.603 --> 00:12:50.979
That's enough.

00:12:51.062 --> 00:12:52.189
One-day teammate.

00:12:52.731 --> 00:12:55.233
Get up there. I'll take one of you.

00:12:55.317 --> 00:12:56.526
Go on, Seong-A.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:57.694
-Thank you.
-Sure.

00:13:00.405 --> 00:13:03.909
-Stand closer to each other.
-Do your thing, and we'll take the photos.

00:13:05.994 --> 00:13:08.663
Okay. One, two, three.

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:10.123
-Smile, will you?
-Wait, me too.

00:13:10.207 --> 00:13:11.583
-What?
-What?

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:15.962
Must you be the third wheel, punk?

00:13:16.046 --> 00:13:17.547
Read the room.

00:13:17.631 --> 00:13:20.008
One… One, two, three.

00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:23.512
It was better when it was just them two.

00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.397
Let's go eat beef!

00:13:34.481 --> 00:13:36.149
-Hooray!
-Yes!

00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:38.777
One-day teammate. You can come too.

00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.655
-I have to go home.
-Coach,

00:13:41.738 --> 00:13:43.323
I'd like to leave early too.

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:46.618
-But why?
-Yeah, come on. Join us.

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:47.994
It's just…

00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:51.039
I want to show this to my grandma.

00:13:51.122 --> 00:13:52.374
She'd be pleased.

00:13:52.457 --> 00:13:54.125
I apologize. Sorry, guys.

00:13:54.209 --> 00:13:57.337
My gosh, don't apologize for that.
You're making me feel bad.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.421
My apologies.

00:13:58.505 --> 00:14:01.132
-Spend quality time with your grandmother.
-Shall I come with you?

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:03.009
No, I'll go on my own.

00:14:03.093 --> 00:14:04.094
Okay.

00:14:04.177 --> 00:14:06.930
Hey, why are you being so nice?

00:14:07.013 --> 00:14:08.431
Do you want lots of beef?

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:11.226
I plan to eat a lot
even if you buy us very little.

00:14:11.309 --> 00:14:12.435
-Let's go!
-Yes!

00:14:12.519 --> 00:14:13.895
-Let's go.
-Beef!

00:14:13.979 --> 00:14:15.021
Let's go!

00:14:17.649 --> 00:14:20.318
You don't have to come with me.
I'll go on my own.

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.737
Okay, I won't tag along.

00:14:22.821 --> 00:14:24.864
You'll be fine even if we're apart today.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:28.952
By the way, Gyeon-U,

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:31.454
is there anything unusual about your body?

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:34.874
No, not at all.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:37.043
That's a relief.

00:14:37.961 --> 00:14:39.796
-What about you?
-What?

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:45.802
I've never felt better.

00:14:48.138 --> 00:14:49.139
That's good.

00:15:19.878 --> 00:15:23.882
You cast the Unify Spell
to become one with someone else.

00:15:25.008 --> 00:15:26.635
But you got hit with a curse instead?

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:31.056
You used a spell,
but it returned to you as a curse.

00:15:31.556 --> 00:15:33.016
What do you think that means?

00:15:38.647 --> 00:15:41.858
It means unifying with you
is a curse for them.

00:15:45.654 --> 00:15:49.032
They were so against the unification
that they chose to curse me.

00:15:50.575 --> 00:15:52.160
But too bad.

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.705
Maybe it's because
we come from the same roots,

00:15:56.331 --> 00:15:57.916
but the Unify Spell did kind of work.

00:16:04.047 --> 00:16:06.174
That would never be enough
to bring down the shrine.

00:16:10.178 --> 00:16:11.304
Stomp harder…

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:13.765
What happened to you?

00:16:13.848 --> 00:16:15.266
-It's no big deal.
-As if.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.685
Someone cursed you.

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.312
Who's the bastard?

00:16:19.396 --> 00:16:21.731
Who would hurt a kid like you?

00:16:24.067 --> 00:16:26.319
You used the Unify Spell to harm Seong-A?

00:16:29.406 --> 00:16:30.448
What is it?

00:16:31.866 --> 00:16:33.660
Are you angry
I went after your spirit-daughter?

00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:35.370
It's not like you're her birth mom.

00:16:36.413 --> 00:16:38.415
If you need someone to hate, hate me only.

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:40.083
That's impossible.

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:43.169
When you hate someone,
you loathe the ring they wore,

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:45.505
their favorite hat,

00:16:45.588 --> 00:16:46.715
their pet dog,

00:16:46.798 --> 00:16:48.049
their neighborhood,

00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:49.843
and the neighbors they greeted.

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:52.220
You want to shove them all
in the trash can.

00:16:52.303 --> 00:16:53.430
How can you channel

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:55.265
the hatred on that person alone?

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:58.059
I can't do that.

00:16:59.811 --> 00:17:01.438
I hate everything about you.

00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:08.903
Will you go on

00:17:10.071 --> 00:17:11.781
living in hell like that?

00:17:16.578 --> 00:17:17.662
Yes.

00:17:20.749 --> 00:17:21.833
Grandma.

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:26.921
I won a gold medal.

00:17:28.465 --> 00:17:29.966
I had a bit of trouble

00:17:31.176 --> 00:17:32.510
seeing the target clearly.

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.764
But I kept my focus.

00:17:35.847 --> 00:17:38.224
THE LATE OH OK-SUN

00:17:50.987 --> 00:17:52.238
Hello, ma'am.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.036
Hello.

00:18:02.248 --> 00:18:03.500
My head hurts.

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:05.084
Hey, you.

00:18:06.795 --> 00:18:09.589
I have a splitting headache
because of you.

00:18:09.672 --> 00:18:10.715
You know that?

00:18:22.894 --> 00:18:24.187
Darn it.

00:18:24.729 --> 00:18:26.439
My eyes are acting up now too.

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:29.609
Oh, dear.

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.570
You should've stayed away from me.

00:18:32.654 --> 00:18:33.905
Avoid me and move on.

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:35.532
Then what about Gyeon-U?

00:18:36.699 --> 00:18:38.868
It's you who should avoid me.

00:18:38.952 --> 00:18:40.328
You can't beat me anyway.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.252
Darling child.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:51.881
I'm getting tired of playing with you.

00:18:54.634 --> 00:18:56.386
What makes you think you can threaten me?

00:18:58.012 --> 00:18:59.013
Kid.

00:18:59.097 --> 00:19:00.557
Your family abandoned you, right?

00:19:03.059 --> 00:19:05.144
They exploited and ditched you
while you were young.

00:19:05.228 --> 00:19:06.271
Yeomhwa.

00:19:06.354 --> 00:19:08.773
-Please don't.
-Fairy God is your patron deity.

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.235
Isn't it a bit too much
that we share the patron deity too?

00:19:12.902 --> 00:19:15.280
What on earth are you saying? Come on out.

00:19:15.363 --> 00:19:16.364
Let's go.

00:19:19.284 --> 00:19:20.660
I don't feel alien to you, right?

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.163
You don't feel alien to me either.

00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:28.001
You're just like me.

00:19:29.294 --> 00:19:31.838
She brought you home
after she kicked me out.

00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:35.717
You were alone like me.

00:19:36.676 --> 00:19:37.802
You were miserable like me.

00:19:38.928 --> 00:19:40.930
And you were cursed like me.

00:19:41.014 --> 00:19:42.473
Shut your mouth.

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.731
Seong-A is nothing like you.

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:50.982
I raised her differently.

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:52.817
What's more,

00:19:52.901 --> 00:19:55.320
I'll start over with you from now on.

00:19:55.862 --> 00:20:00.366
I'll pour my heart into you like a mother
carrying her baby for nine months.

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:03.620
I won't let you go ever again.

00:20:10.293 --> 00:20:12.795
Seong-A's clothes were blotched black?

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.797
Yes.

00:20:14.881 --> 00:20:16.966
Her energy got tainted.

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.593
She will receive divine punishment.

00:20:20.678 --> 00:20:22.347
About that punishment.

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:24.515
Is there any way I can take it instead?

00:20:24.599 --> 00:20:25.683
No.

00:20:26.434 --> 00:20:28.770
If you aren't a shaman,
the punishment will kill you.

00:20:29.812 --> 00:20:32.357
Can you at least
undo the Suppress Technique?

00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:36.945
Didn't you call me
to help you stop seeing ghosts?

00:20:38.154 --> 00:20:39.489
Well, I did…

00:20:40.365 --> 00:20:42.200
But Seong-A's safety comes first.

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:44.035
That's more urgent for me.

00:20:47.288 --> 00:20:48.373
Okay.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.000
Let me think.

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:56.547
As your Human Amulet,
Seong-A must have given you something.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:02.095
It's right here.

00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:15.817
Could it be true?

00:21:18.277 --> 00:21:21.239
What Yeomhwa said about Mother
raising me as her replacement.

00:21:22.031 --> 00:21:24.826
Raising a child is no easy feat,

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:28.997
so one can't just replace
one with another.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.711
I did find her strange
since the day we met.

00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:38.172
When we did the Flower Lantern Dance,

00:21:38.256 --> 00:21:42.093
we were so in sync,
as if we had practiced together.

00:21:43.428 --> 00:21:44.762
That's only natural.

00:21:44.846 --> 00:21:48.141
You learned the dance
from the same spirit-mother.

00:21:50.893 --> 00:21:52.186
If that's the case,

00:21:52.937 --> 00:21:55.815
does that mean I might become
evil like she has?

00:21:56.357 --> 00:21:58.693
You will find this hard to believe,

00:21:58.776 --> 00:22:02.405
but she used to be such a sweet
and tenderhearted soul.

00:22:02.488 --> 00:22:05.950
But people would use that against her,
and she'd get her heart broken.

00:22:07.285 --> 00:22:10.371
There's a reason
the General has a soft spot for her.

00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:13.374
Still,

00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:16.502
you don't have to worry.

00:22:18.671 --> 00:22:21.090
She's got someone to guide her
back on track.

00:22:22.925 --> 00:22:25.845
Even if a stream takes a wrong turn,

00:22:25.928 --> 00:22:28.181
as long as the ocean stands firm,

00:22:28.264 --> 00:22:30.391
nothing will be a problem.

00:22:35.855 --> 00:22:36.898
Okay.

00:22:39.067 --> 00:22:40.151
I can't undo it.

00:22:40.234 --> 00:22:41.903
-We'll have to give it up.
-Excuse me?

00:22:41.986 --> 00:22:44.363
The power of the Human Amulet
binding you two is too strong.

00:22:44.447 --> 00:22:47.158
You guys have such a powerful will to
protect each other

00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:49.035
that no other spell can overpower it.

00:22:49.118 --> 00:22:50.870
What should we do, then?

00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:53.748
Here's a suggestion.

00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:57.043
I'll offer this up
to the Deities of Seven Stars

00:22:57.126 --> 00:22:58.669
and pray over it for you.

00:22:58.753 --> 00:23:02.423
The Deities of Seven Stars
decide how long we live.

00:23:02.507 --> 00:23:04.092
And they're my patron deities.

00:23:04.801 --> 00:23:06.886
This served as a Human Amulet's stand-in,

00:23:06.969 --> 00:23:10.556
so the deities
will protect both you and Seong-A.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.974
Okay. I'd like that.

00:23:12.058 --> 00:23:13.184
Please do that.

00:23:14.685 --> 00:23:15.686
From now on,

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.648
you must stay well away from ghosts.

00:23:19.482 --> 00:23:22.985
First, you must avoid evil ghosts.

00:23:23.069 --> 00:23:24.070
Second,

00:23:24.612 --> 00:23:26.823
even if you get involved with one,

00:23:26.906 --> 00:23:28.825
you must never see nor shed blood.

00:23:28.908 --> 00:23:32.161
If blood tarnishes you,
there's no going back.

00:23:34.372 --> 00:23:37.083
-Will I die, then?
-It'll be worse than that.

00:23:38.084 --> 00:23:41.712
You would be neither alive nor dead.
That's what you'll face.

00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:46.926
Consider yourself as fragile as glass
and be careful for the time being.

00:23:48.136 --> 00:23:49.804
Do that until the Deities of Seven Stars

00:23:50.847 --> 00:23:53.599
manage to close your ears and eyes
from the spirit world.

00:23:53.683 --> 00:23:54.851
Can you do that?

00:23:56.519 --> 00:23:57.687
I'll try.

00:24:25.173 --> 00:24:26.424
Hey.

00:24:27.341 --> 00:24:30.094
I keep seeing things from you.

00:24:30.636 --> 00:24:32.096
What did you do now?

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.808
I merged my energy with yours
with the Unify Spell.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.481
What's wrong?

00:24:44.108 --> 00:24:45.735
Do I look like a demon?

00:24:49.572 --> 00:24:51.324
I see a wooden box about this big.

00:24:51.407 --> 00:24:54.702
White cloth is keeping it shut,
and you're carrying it on your back.

00:24:55.453 --> 00:24:58.080
It's a shame
that I don't look like a demon to you.

00:25:37.828 --> 00:25:39.497
It's the nice guy.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.874
-Hello.
-Want to see my baby?

00:25:43.125 --> 00:25:44.335
-Here.
-Your baby…

00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:49.382
How cute.

00:25:49.465 --> 00:25:50.591
Right?

00:25:56.973 --> 00:25:58.557
My goodness.

00:26:00.977 --> 00:26:01.811
You're…

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.272
You're a human.

00:26:05.273 --> 00:26:06.399
You're talking to me?

00:26:06.482 --> 00:26:08.651
No. That's not what I meant.

00:26:09.694 --> 00:26:10.695
You're…

00:26:11.654 --> 00:26:12.738
Darn it.

00:26:13.531 --> 00:26:14.740
You're getting on my nerves.

00:26:14.824 --> 00:26:16.075
You look like you'd kick my tip box.

00:26:17.118 --> 00:26:18.327
What?

00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:20.955
I'd kick what?

00:26:23.916 --> 00:26:25.835
Hey, Beom.

00:26:37.138 --> 00:26:38.806
Give me some money.

00:26:38.889 --> 00:26:40.391
Text back.

00:26:40.474 --> 00:26:43.394
Answer me. Go on. I'm waiting.

00:26:43.477 --> 00:26:44.478
Reply this instant.

00:26:44.562 --> 00:26:46.480
Reply fast. Come on. Answer.

00:26:46.564 --> 00:26:47.940
I'll wait until you show up.

00:26:53.154 --> 00:26:54.238
From now on,

00:26:54.864 --> 00:26:57.908
you must stay well away from ghosts.

00:26:57.992 --> 00:27:02.371
Consider yourself as fragile as glass
and be careful for the time being.

00:27:32.151 --> 00:27:33.778
Hey, young and handsome.

00:27:34.278 --> 00:27:36.197
-You just got back?
-Yes.

00:27:38.783 --> 00:27:42.036
Listen, handsome. Heaven and Earth Fairy
will be in a lot of pain pretty soon.

00:27:42.119 --> 00:27:43.621
Take good care of her.

00:27:46.791 --> 00:27:48.334
Will she suffer a lot?

00:27:48.417 --> 00:27:49.668
Yeah, it will hurt like hell.

00:27:50.294 --> 00:27:51.629
It's a shaman thing.

00:27:51.712 --> 00:27:53.964
No medicine or doctor can help.

00:27:54.048 --> 00:27:57.009
We just have to deal with it.

00:27:59.428 --> 00:28:01.972
There's that,
but she must be pretty miserable now too.

00:28:02.056 --> 00:28:03.808
Her heart must be shattered.

00:28:05.017 --> 00:28:07.520
But why? Is something wrong?

00:28:10.022 --> 00:28:12.108
It's a family thing.
You don't need to know.

00:28:12.191 --> 00:28:13.442
Oh, okay.

00:28:17.321 --> 00:28:20.533
I hope your pretty face
makes her feel better.

00:28:20.616 --> 00:28:22.034
I don't know anymore.

00:28:23.786 --> 00:28:25.204
Don't worry too much.

00:28:25.287 --> 00:28:27.581
I'll see what I can do.

00:28:28.124 --> 00:28:28.958
But how?

00:28:31.168 --> 00:28:32.670
With my pretty face?

00:28:34.213 --> 00:28:35.381
You're hilarious.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:52.231
Hey.

00:28:53.441 --> 00:28:54.442
Hi.

00:28:56.569 --> 00:28:58.612
How was your visit to your grandmother?

00:28:59.238 --> 00:29:00.448
Well…

00:29:00.531 --> 00:29:02.783
It was pretty good.

00:29:28.225 --> 00:29:31.770
We used to be joined at the hip
to use the power of the Human Amulet,

00:29:31.854 --> 00:29:33.272
and now we're apart.

00:29:34.523 --> 00:29:36.859
-It feels weird, doesn't it?
-Yeah.

00:29:41.155 --> 00:29:44.825
I've always thought
your room is really pretty.

00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:46.952
It's nicely decorated.

00:29:48.662 --> 00:29:50.789
Did you pick everything out?

00:29:52.082 --> 00:29:53.167
Yeah.

00:30:01.008 --> 00:30:02.426
You must've been busy,

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:03.802
but I see you've still studied

00:30:04.803 --> 00:30:07.056
really hard…

00:30:07.139 --> 00:30:10.100
Well, not really.

00:30:19.693 --> 00:30:21.737
"Bae Gyeon-U! Save him! Protect him!"

00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:22.821
What's this?

00:30:27.076 --> 00:30:28.410
Give me that.

00:30:29.662 --> 00:30:31.080
Why? What is it?

00:30:31.664 --> 00:30:33.624
-It's nothing.
-What is it?

00:30:34.333 --> 00:30:36.293
-Don't read it.
-"Fire Ghost."

00:30:36.377 --> 00:30:38.003
-Don't read it.
-"Suicide Ghost"?

00:30:38.087 --> 00:30:39.880
A Suicide Ghost is nothing?

00:30:39.964 --> 00:30:41.882
I told you not to read it!

00:30:45.719 --> 00:30:48.639
I told you not to read it.
Why do you keep reading it?

00:30:48.722 --> 00:30:50.808
Well, I was just…

00:30:52.476 --> 00:30:53.477
Seong-A.

00:30:59.149 --> 00:31:00.359
I'm sorry.

00:31:16.542 --> 00:31:17.543
Seong-A.

00:31:20.254 --> 00:31:21.630
You're still mad, aren't you?

00:31:23.173 --> 00:31:24.300
Sorry.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.260
I just wondered what it was.

00:31:26.343 --> 00:31:27.428
No.

00:31:29.346 --> 00:31:30.514
I should be the one apologizing.

00:31:34.059 --> 00:31:37.813
But I still don't want you to know.

00:31:39.815 --> 00:31:42.443
Humans should live in the human world.

00:31:42.526 --> 00:31:44.778
If you get involved with ghosts,

00:31:44.862 --> 00:31:46.655
you'll end up on the boundary.

00:31:48.449 --> 00:31:49.450
I want you

00:31:50.326 --> 00:31:53.329
to be free of shamans as soon as possible.

00:31:54.288 --> 00:31:55.998
I want you to be ordinary.

00:32:01.503 --> 00:32:02.588
I see.

00:32:03.922 --> 00:32:06.967
If she finds out I can now see ghosts,
she'll be so upset.

00:32:07.885 --> 00:32:09.136
I must keep it a secret.

00:32:10.304 --> 00:32:11.388
I hear you.

00:32:12.848 --> 00:32:14.433
But don't worry too much.

00:32:15.684 --> 00:32:16.894
Everything will be fine.

00:32:19.855 --> 00:32:20.856
Seong-A.

00:32:26.445 --> 00:32:28.405
Seong-A. Are you asleep?

00:32:43.379 --> 00:32:44.463
She's doing it again.

00:32:45.506 --> 00:32:46.590
She keeps

00:32:47.341 --> 00:32:48.592
doing this to me.

00:32:53.597 --> 00:32:54.723
Try raising your arms like this.

00:32:54.807 --> 00:32:57.643
You darn minors!

00:33:07.611 --> 00:33:09.530
Didn't I tell you

00:33:09.613 --> 00:33:11.323
to hold her hand only?

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.202
You old hag of a shaman!
You beat me all the time.

00:33:15.285 --> 00:33:17.079
It wasn't me!

00:33:17.579 --> 00:33:18.414
Hey!

00:33:23.836 --> 00:33:25.462
It's not like that.

00:33:26.422 --> 00:33:27.589
I can explain how…

00:33:31.260 --> 00:33:32.386
Oh, my soles…

00:33:36.598 --> 00:33:37.933
Hey, why are you guys so late…

00:33:39.268 --> 00:33:40.686
What's wrong? What happened?

00:33:40.769 --> 00:33:41.812
You got hurt?

00:33:41.895 --> 00:33:43.772
Did you ever feel so wronged
you wanted to die?

00:33:43.856 --> 00:33:45.274
That's how I feel right now.

00:33:45.941 --> 00:33:47.651
"My hopes and dreams."

00:33:49.278 --> 00:33:50.487
Did you all get the sheet?

00:33:51.113 --> 00:33:52.865
Think about your goals
and future aspirations.

00:33:52.948 --> 00:33:54.616
They can be both personal
and professional.

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:57.453
Write whatever comes to mind freely.

00:33:57.536 --> 00:33:58.746
I did say "freely,"

00:33:58.829 --> 00:34:02.207
but don't write down
"conquering the planet and the universe."

00:34:02.291 --> 00:34:04.501
"I have no dreams."
I won't accept that either, okay?

00:34:04.585 --> 00:34:06.962
-Okay.
-Copy others' answers if you're stuck.

00:34:07.546 --> 00:34:08.589
Now, get to it.

00:34:10.340 --> 00:34:11.383
Let me see.

00:34:11.467 --> 00:34:12.926
We're writing about dreams.

00:34:13.969 --> 00:34:15.137
My dream?

00:34:26.523 --> 00:34:28.442
Sa-rang, do you have a dream?

00:34:28.525 --> 00:34:29.985
What do you think? No.

00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.069
You don't either.

00:34:31.153 --> 00:34:33.030
I do. I want to own a butcher shop.

00:34:37.743 --> 00:34:38.827
I WANT TO OWN A BUTCHER SHOP

00:34:38.911 --> 00:34:41.038
You're copying my dream?
Shall we be business partners?

00:34:42.206 --> 00:34:43.373
-I'll be the boss.
-Okay.

00:34:43.457 --> 00:34:44.458
-Deal.
-What?

00:34:55.385 --> 00:34:58.889
Your dream is just as pathetic as you.

00:35:08.524 --> 00:35:09.817
Get up here, Seong-A.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.109
I knew he'd call you up.

00:35:11.944 --> 00:35:14.321
Gyeon-U, you too.

00:35:23.705 --> 00:35:25.040
Read your answers out loud.

00:35:38.178 --> 00:35:40.597
"My dream is to go to a college."

00:35:40.681 --> 00:35:44.268
"I don't know what I want to study,
but I want to go to a four-year college."

00:35:44.351 --> 00:35:46.562
"I want to attend
my high school graduation ceremony

00:35:46.645 --> 00:35:48.230
and college entrance ceremony."

00:35:49.898 --> 00:35:53.485
"I want to take a photo
with a bouquet of flowers."

00:35:54.444 --> 00:35:55.654
That's what I wrote.

00:35:55.737 --> 00:35:57.072
Basically, all you want

00:35:57.573 --> 00:35:58.740
is to graduate and go to college?

00:36:00.951 --> 00:36:03.161
To be exact,
I want to attend both ceremonies.

00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:06.206
Do I have to choose one or the other?

00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:08.417
Then I want to go
to my graduation ceremony.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.837
I was at a couple of entrance ceremonies
but never at a graduation ceremony--

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:13.839
No, both are unacceptable.

00:36:13.922 --> 00:36:15.966
Forget something everyone does in time.

00:36:16.049 --> 00:36:18.677
Come up with something
you need to work to accomplish, okay?

00:36:19.344 --> 00:36:22.598
-But it does take work for me to graduate.
-Next, Gyeon-U.

00:36:25.142 --> 00:36:26.435
Something that takes work?

00:36:28.645 --> 00:36:29.730
Okay.

00:36:29.813 --> 00:36:31.481
"My dream is…"

00:36:31.565 --> 00:36:33.150
Well…

00:36:38.947 --> 00:36:41.491
-I'll change it to something else.
-All right. Do that.

00:36:42.367 --> 00:36:43.493
Get back to your seat.

00:36:47.623 --> 00:36:50.626
Why is this seat still empty?
Are they in the restroom?

00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:52.085
That's Beom's seat.

00:36:52.169 --> 00:36:53.295
He's not here yet.

00:36:53.378 --> 00:36:56.506
Even our model student
is causing trouble now?

00:36:58.467 --> 00:36:59.968
I expected no less from you guys.

00:37:00.052 --> 00:37:02.012
-There's always trouble, right?
-Hey.

00:37:02.554 --> 00:37:04.097
Why didn't you read your answer?

00:37:04.681 --> 00:37:05.682
What did you write?

00:37:06.642 --> 00:37:07.684
Don't…

00:37:08.644 --> 00:37:09.811
AN ADULT

00:37:09.895 --> 00:37:12.814
"An adult"?
Your dream is to become an adult?

00:37:13.398 --> 00:37:15.275
Give me that. I'll change it.

00:37:16.777 --> 00:37:19.154
This isn't something that requires effort.

00:37:19.988 --> 00:37:21.156
I'll change it.

00:37:31.291 --> 00:37:33.001
I wonder how old Bong-su is.

00:37:33.377 --> 00:37:34.628
That's a random question.

00:37:35.212 --> 00:37:37.464
I'm thinking he could be younger than us.

00:37:38.924 --> 00:37:40.550
That feels a bit…

00:37:40.634 --> 00:37:42.427
Right. It's not nice.

00:37:43.929 --> 00:37:45.472
Yo, Beom!

00:37:45.555 --> 00:37:48.100
Why are you so late? I missed you.

00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:53.230
Are you feeling that bad?

00:37:55.983 --> 00:37:57.109
Rest up.

00:37:57.192 --> 00:37:59.027
What? Did you call me?

00:37:59.111 --> 00:38:00.320
Why was he late to school?

00:38:00.404 --> 00:38:01.446
I don't know why.

00:38:05.158 --> 00:38:06.159
A Suicide Ghost?

00:38:18.547 --> 00:38:20.257
Where the heck did he go to now?

00:38:22.009 --> 00:38:24.219
I'd like to throw
some salt on him at least.

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:31.059
-Gyeon-U.
-Yeah?

00:38:31.143 --> 00:38:34.813
I need to do something.
Can I let go of your hand?

00:38:35.439 --> 00:38:36.440
Well…

00:38:37.107 --> 00:38:37.983
No, you can't.

00:38:38.859 --> 00:38:40.736
What? I can't?

00:38:40.819 --> 00:38:41.862
No.

00:38:41.945 --> 00:38:43.030
I mean…

00:38:43.905 --> 00:38:45.741
I said I'd protect you.

00:38:46.491 --> 00:38:47.909
To do that, I need to hold onto you.

00:38:53.915 --> 00:38:54.916
You're blushing.

00:38:58.086 --> 00:39:00.964
Who wouldn't blush
after hearing something like that?

00:39:02.174 --> 00:39:03.800
No, I don't think that's it.

00:39:06.428 --> 00:39:08.221
I think you're coming down with something.

00:39:09.347 --> 00:39:10.348
You have a fever.

00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:13.351
What?

00:39:16.938 --> 00:39:17.939
I'm done for.

00:39:18.565 --> 00:39:20.233
Is it the punishment?

00:39:27.115 --> 00:39:28.950
I see a wooden box about this big.

00:39:29.034 --> 00:39:31.787
White cloth is keeping it shut,
and you're carrying it on your back.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:35.874
She's too good a shaman
to have seen wrong.

00:39:49.054 --> 00:39:50.222
"A wooden box"?

00:39:50.305 --> 00:39:51.765
I see a wooden box about this big.

00:39:54.518 --> 00:39:55.894
A wooden box.

00:39:56.394 --> 00:39:59.439
White cloth is keeping it shut,
and you're carrying it on your back.

00:40:00.315 --> 00:40:01.900
"White cloth is keeping it shut"?

00:40:03.902 --> 00:40:05.403
Tied with white cloth…

00:40:07.405 --> 00:40:10.075
A wooden box tied with white cloth.

00:40:24.923 --> 00:40:25.924
A coffin?

00:40:56.496 --> 00:40:58.665
I can only save one of the two?

00:40:59.374 --> 00:41:01.042
That's too cruel.

00:41:08.216 --> 00:41:09.843
Why didn't you tell me?

00:41:15.307 --> 00:41:18.018
Why didn't you tell me? Answer me.

00:41:19.477 --> 00:41:22.606
Why didn't you tell me?
Why did you keep it from me?

00:41:31.239 --> 00:41:33.617
Why did you keep it a secret?

00:41:34.451 --> 00:41:35.785
Why?

00:41:35.869 --> 00:41:37.454
Why did you keep it a secret?

00:41:38.121 --> 00:41:40.207
Why didn't you tell me?

00:41:41.041 --> 00:41:42.626
Why did you keep it from me?

00:42:03.730 --> 00:42:04.856
Why?

00:42:06.399 --> 00:42:08.860
Why didn't you tell me?

00:42:15.951 --> 00:42:16.952
Why…

00:42:21.498 --> 00:42:24.417
My child…

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.461
My baby.

00:42:27.754 --> 00:42:28.755
My baby is on my back

00:42:29.297 --> 00:42:31.925
but is stuck inside a coffin
and can't even touch me.

00:42:32.467 --> 00:42:35.637
Mom, why didn't you tell me
my baby was locked up in a coffin?

00:42:39.099 --> 00:42:41.476
Why didn't you tell me?

00:42:42.936 --> 00:42:44.729
Why?

00:42:47.357 --> 00:42:48.483
Why did you keep it from me?

00:42:49.192 --> 00:42:51.236
Why did you keep it a secret?

00:42:53.363 --> 00:42:55.407
Why didn't you tell me?

00:43:04.874 --> 00:43:06.084
Yeomhwa!

00:43:06.167 --> 00:43:09.129
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Yeomhwa.

00:43:09.212 --> 00:43:10.839
-Why?
-Yeomhwa!

00:43:10.922 --> 00:43:12.549
-Why didn't you…
-Yeomhwa.

00:43:12.632 --> 00:43:15.802
-Why didn't you tell me?
-Yeomhwa.

00:43:16.344 --> 00:43:17.429
Why?

00:43:17.512 --> 00:43:18.555
My baby…

00:43:18.638 --> 00:43:19.889
On my back…

00:43:20.432 --> 00:43:21.516
-On my back…
-Yeomhwa.

00:43:26.813 --> 00:43:28.148
Seong-A.

00:43:28.231 --> 00:43:30.317
Let's just go home, okay?

00:43:31.109 --> 00:43:32.360
No.

00:43:32.444 --> 00:43:35.196
You'll lose your touch
if you miss practice even for just a day.

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.781
You should train.

00:43:37.282 --> 00:43:39.492
How can I train when you're so sick?

00:43:39.576 --> 00:43:40.660
Let's go.

00:43:42.704 --> 00:43:45.123
I'll go wash my face with cold water.

00:43:45.206 --> 00:43:46.249
Okay.

00:43:46.333 --> 00:43:47.334
No, wait…

00:43:57.969 --> 00:43:58.970
Hey.

00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:02.307
Did you have fun
while I was gone yesterday?

00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:04.684
Just how much fun did you have
that she got so sick?

00:44:04.768 --> 00:44:06.019
She's not sick.

00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:08.396
-It's divine punishment.
-Divine punishment?

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.898
Did the shaman do something wrong?

00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:11.524
I don't know.

00:44:13.234 --> 00:44:15.320
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of her by her side.

00:44:15.403 --> 00:44:16.488
How would you do that?

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.949
I'm with her right now,
and you're in the mirror.

00:44:33.963 --> 00:44:34.964
Gyeon-U.

00:44:36.132 --> 00:44:37.092
Seong-A.

00:44:40.428 --> 00:44:42.555
Would you look at that?
She's in really bad shape.

00:44:43.056 --> 00:44:44.099
Hey.

00:44:44.641 --> 00:44:45.934
I'm not Gyeon-U.

00:44:53.441 --> 00:44:55.860
This won't do. Let's go home, Seong-A.

00:45:12.669 --> 00:45:15.755
Grave sins are
followed by harsh punishment.

00:45:17.799 --> 00:45:19.968
Do you think
it hurts more to suffer yourself

00:45:20.552 --> 00:45:22.554
or to watch your loved one suffer?

00:45:25.056 --> 00:45:28.268
It's much more painful
to watch a loved one suffer.

00:45:28.351 --> 00:45:29.185
That's why

00:45:30.854 --> 00:45:32.480
the heavens decided

00:45:33.356 --> 00:45:35.275
to punish your child instead of you.

00:45:37.318 --> 00:45:38.570
So that you would suffer.

00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:42.574
To suffer as much as
the evil you have committed.

00:45:46.494 --> 00:45:48.663
I'll curse you until I die.

00:45:49.706 --> 00:45:52.250
No. I'll curse you even in death.

00:45:54.919 --> 00:45:56.296
I prayed to the heavens every day

00:45:57.672 --> 00:45:59.257
to forgive you.

00:46:00.216 --> 00:46:01.759
I will curse you.

00:46:30.371 --> 00:46:31.414
It's a little too late, no?

00:46:32.457 --> 00:46:33.541
I don't need it.

00:46:35.627 --> 00:46:37.378
You said you'd curse me.

00:46:39.005 --> 00:46:41.841
You'd need an item of mine
to do that, remember?

00:46:43.176 --> 00:46:47.138
I kept this on me every day for ten years,
so the curse will work well.

00:46:56.314 --> 00:46:57.732
Try your best.

00:47:03.071 --> 00:47:04.072
We'll be back soon.

00:47:09.994 --> 00:47:11.246
MO BEOM

00:47:13.957 --> 00:47:15.708
Please, stop calling me.

00:47:17.168 --> 00:47:18.169
Will you just…

00:47:20.338 --> 00:47:21.381
Stop it.

00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:23.841
Did you smash up the chocolate?

00:47:23.925 --> 00:47:25.635
-Do you have someone to give yours?
-This?

00:47:25.718 --> 00:47:26.761
-Come on.
-No way.

00:47:26.844 --> 00:47:27.845
How about strawberry?

00:47:27.929 --> 00:47:29.055
-Who is it?
-It's a secret.

00:47:30.306 --> 00:47:31.307
-No.
-I want to try.

00:47:31.391 --> 00:47:33.309
-I'll try it.
-That's boring.

00:47:33.393 --> 00:47:34.394
It's too rich.

00:47:36.354 --> 00:47:38.356
-Add just half.
-How about…

00:47:38.439 --> 00:47:39.691
Melt it for now.

00:47:39.774 --> 00:47:41.276
You turned it into a powder.

00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:44.320
I'll do the rest.

00:47:44.988 --> 00:47:46.656
-Get some rest.
-But…

00:47:58.251 --> 00:47:59.544
Hey.

00:48:00.336 --> 00:48:01.713
Do you think that will fit in this?

00:48:03.172 --> 00:48:04.465
I won't put it in that.

00:48:05.008 --> 00:48:08.177
That box is too small for my work of art.

00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:16.311
Bok-i never did as she was told.

00:48:17.312 --> 00:48:19.480
She refused to listen to anyone

00:48:20.648 --> 00:48:21.649
just like me.

00:48:23.151 --> 00:48:24.235
Hey, Jin-ung.

00:48:24.319 --> 00:48:26.571
-Are you actually crying?
-Why are you crying?

00:48:27.196 --> 00:48:29.240
Jin-ung.

00:48:29.949 --> 00:48:31.826
I told you to stop crying over Do-yeon.

00:48:32.535 --> 00:48:34.621
She was born before Bok-i.

00:48:34.704 --> 00:48:35.997
She can't be Bok-i's reincarnation.

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.624
Who cares about that?

00:48:38.708 --> 00:48:41.669
What matters
is that I love and cherish Do-yeon.

00:48:43.796 --> 00:48:45.798
I think you've actually gone crazy.

00:48:45.882 --> 00:48:47.008
Sure.

00:48:47.091 --> 00:48:48.217
I'm crazy.

00:48:48.885 --> 00:48:50.261
I'm crazy for Do-yeon.

00:48:52.764 --> 00:48:53.765
Stop crying!

00:48:53.848 --> 00:48:55.099
It's okay.

00:48:55.183 --> 00:48:56.726
Does anything here need crushing?

00:48:56.809 --> 00:48:58.561
I'll crush everything for you.

00:48:58.645 --> 00:49:01.189
That crazy idiot over there.
Crush him for me.

00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:02.273
Okay.

00:49:03.149 --> 00:49:04.400
I swear,

00:49:05.151 --> 00:49:06.444
I'll just smash everything.

00:49:13.701 --> 00:49:16.371
Why's your phone vibrating so much?

00:49:18.706 --> 00:49:19.707
Turn it off.

00:49:23.169 --> 00:49:24.170
Hey.

00:49:25.004 --> 00:49:26.005
Where are you going?

00:49:32.804 --> 00:49:33.638
Why won't you reply?

00:49:34.222 --> 00:49:35.223
After school, okay?

00:49:35.807 --> 00:49:36.808
Come over right away.

00:49:37.850 --> 00:49:39.310
Bring your friend from now on.

00:49:40.019 --> 00:49:41.229
That kid, Ju-seung.

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:05.420
Why is one missing?

00:50:16.264 --> 00:50:17.265
I can't.

00:50:17.348 --> 00:50:18.933
Beom is in a very bad state.

00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:20.268
What's the matter?

00:50:20.351 --> 00:50:22.770
Let's go to the teachers' office
and tell our teacher.

00:50:22.854 --> 00:50:24.897
I can't explain. I have to do this.

00:50:25.940 --> 00:50:28.151
I can't get involved with any ghosts.

00:50:32.488 --> 00:50:34.574
Seong-A, we can't go in there.

00:50:34.657 --> 00:50:37.285
Let's tell the teacher. Come with me.

00:50:37.952 --> 00:50:38.953
Let's go.

00:50:39.704 --> 00:50:41.164
Come, Seong-A.

00:50:41.873 --> 00:50:43.332
I'm sorry.

00:50:45.585 --> 00:50:47.253
-What's this?
-Shoot.

00:50:53.509 --> 00:50:55.094
Beom, come outside.

00:50:55.178 --> 00:50:56.929
I know what you're thinking.

00:50:57.013 --> 00:50:58.514
Will you open the door?

00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.941
Beom, please open the door.

00:51:09.025 --> 00:51:10.485
Seong-A, we should go.

00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:12.278
Wait.

00:51:12.361 --> 00:51:13.446
Hey.

00:51:14.405 --> 00:51:16.449
You said you'd protect her.

00:51:16.532 --> 00:51:18.659
You can't let her go
to a Suicide Ghost by herself.

00:51:18.743 --> 00:51:19.869
A Suicide Ghost?

00:51:20.536 --> 00:51:21.621
Beom.

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:23.873
Don't entertain such thoughts.

00:51:24.916 --> 00:51:26.125
That's not you.

00:51:26.209 --> 00:51:27.335
It's just because

00:51:28.795 --> 00:51:30.338
you're having a hard time.

00:51:31.923 --> 00:51:33.800
Gyeon-U, don't entertain such thoughts.

00:51:34.967 --> 00:51:37.303
Your grandmother would be sad

00:51:37.970 --> 00:51:39.305
to see you like this.

00:51:41.682 --> 00:51:43.142
I'm the problem.

00:51:43.643 --> 00:51:45.603
I got Ju-seung dragged into this…

00:51:47.438 --> 00:51:48.815
It'll be fine if I disappear.

00:51:51.609 --> 00:51:52.652
I'm sorry…

00:51:55.029 --> 00:51:56.948
for being the source
of your unhappiness, Grandma.

00:51:59.242 --> 00:52:00.409
That won't do, Seong-A.

00:52:01.327 --> 00:52:02.745
Hold on tight, okay?

00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:03.830
What?

00:52:14.882 --> 00:52:16.050
Beom!

00:52:16.926 --> 00:52:18.135
Put it down.

00:52:18.886 --> 00:52:20.471
Guys…

00:52:22.265 --> 00:52:24.308
-I'm sorry.
-No, don't!

00:52:25.059 --> 00:52:26.185
Let go!

00:52:37.989 --> 00:52:40.908
Ears, eyes, mouth, nose.

00:52:40.992 --> 00:52:42.827
Ghosts take over your senses
in that order.

00:52:43.411 --> 00:52:45.496
Yeongseol.
You will share your tongue with them.

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.290
What's happening?

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.500
I can't speak.

00:52:49.584 --> 00:52:50.626
Yeongbi.

00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:52.670
You will smell ghosts.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:55.715
Is this the smell of incense?

00:52:55.798 --> 00:52:57.717
Even if you get involved with one,

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.052
you must never see nor shed blood.

00:53:00.136 --> 00:53:03.139
If blood tarnishes you,
there's no going back.

00:53:04.807 --> 00:53:07.184
You would be neither alive nor dead.

00:53:07.268 --> 00:53:08.603
That's what you'll face.

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:17.904
NURSE'S OFFICE

00:53:42.595 --> 00:53:44.555
Gyeon-U. Are you okay?

00:53:47.683 --> 00:53:49.560
Yeah. I feel better than I expected.

00:53:51.604 --> 00:53:52.813
That's a relief.

00:54:03.115 --> 00:54:05.451
You don't seem well, though.

00:54:05.534 --> 00:54:06.535
What?

00:54:10.706 --> 00:54:12.875
Oh, you're right.

00:56:02.234 --> 00:56:04.653
I think I feel a bit better now.

00:56:06.489 --> 00:56:07.490
"A bit"?

00:56:08.491 --> 00:56:10.451
How well are you? Can you walk?

00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:13.954
Yes.

00:56:15.372 --> 00:56:17.500
Why are you so frail?

00:56:18.459 --> 00:56:21.462
Are you sure
you don't have to see a doctor?

00:56:21.545 --> 00:56:22.713
Yeah.

00:56:22.797 --> 00:56:23.923
I'm really okay.

00:56:24.548 --> 00:56:28.052
By the way, when was the last time
you went to archery practice?

00:56:28.636 --> 00:56:29.678
Archery?

00:56:30.262 --> 00:56:33.432
-About two, three days?
-What?

00:56:35.392 --> 00:56:37.686
That's not good. Let's go and practice.

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:40.773
No, don't be silly.
You're not well. You can't go.

00:56:41.357 --> 00:56:43.484
No, I'm really okay now.

00:56:43.567 --> 00:56:44.819
You can't go.

00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:48.656
See? I really am fine now.

00:56:49.865 --> 00:56:51.909
That's cute, but it's still a no.

00:56:51.992 --> 00:56:53.369
No, Seong-A.

00:57:37.246 --> 00:57:38.581
That startled me.

00:57:45.838 --> 00:57:48.507
When will you tell me the truth?

00:57:48.924 --> 00:57:49.758
What?

00:57:51.093 --> 00:57:52.636
What do you mean?

00:57:54.138 --> 00:57:55.139
About Gyeon-U.

00:57:57.224 --> 00:57:58.225
What about me?

00:58:02.646 --> 00:58:03.689
Bong-su.

00:58:04.815 --> 00:58:06.275
"Bong-su"? That came out of nowhere.

00:58:07.193 --> 00:58:08.736
You're Bong-su.

00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:15.534
What on earth are you saying, Seong-A?

00:58:22.958 --> 00:58:24.210
When you were practicing…

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:29.673
You didn't do your routine hand gesture.

00:58:31.592 --> 00:58:32.927
That's just…

00:58:33.010 --> 00:58:35.054
You're not Gyeon-U. You're Bong-su.

00:58:36.639 --> 00:58:39.058
Seong-A, you're scaring me.

00:58:40.809 --> 00:58:41.894
Bong-su.

00:58:43.103 --> 00:58:44.146
What happened to Gyeon-U?

00:58:46.899 --> 00:58:48.317
Where is Gyeon-U?

00:58:55.824 --> 00:58:56.825
I…

00:59:00.871 --> 00:59:02.081
devoured him.

00:59:45.582 --> 00:59:48.961
Yeomhwa plans to summon the Grim Reaper.

00:59:49.044 --> 00:59:50.754
I want to live as a human.

00:59:50.838 --> 00:59:53.257
Tell me how I can
take over his body completely.

00:59:53.340 --> 00:59:56.343
It's not like anyone would
love you if you became human.

00:59:56.427 --> 00:59:57.303
Are you two dating?

00:59:57.386 --> 00:59:59.763
No, it's one-sided on my part.
It's unrequited love.

00:59:59.847 --> 01:00:00.931
You'll be kind to me?

01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:02.182
Yes.

01:00:02.266 --> 01:00:03.475
I'm Bae Gyeon-U.

01:00:03.559 --> 01:00:05.060
Me, the person standing here
is Bae Gyeon-U.

01:00:05.144 --> 01:00:07.813
Gyeon-U, I'll get things back to normal.

01:00:07.896 --> 01:00:10.441
Until then, please stay safe.

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:13.193
Don't you want to know
how Heaven and Earth Fairy really feels?

01:00:13.277 --> 01:00:14.611
See for yourself.

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:22.286
