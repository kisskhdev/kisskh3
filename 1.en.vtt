00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.600
The world-leading conglomerate Junsheng Group has donated to Yun City

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.960
a huge sum of one billion yuan for public welfare.

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.320
Junsheng's president, Gao Feng, is young and capable,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.879
and is considered a business prodigy.

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.559
But he has always kept a low profile,

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.640
and no one has ever seen his true face.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.719
Hello, boss.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.560
Why are you here?

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.000
Boss, you've been away from the company for a month.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.200
Junsheng can't do without you.

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:14.599
We're here to ask you to come back.

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:15.680
Didn't I already say it?

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.560
I'm tired of my old life.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.400
Now I want to live a more interesting life.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.599
But with your status,

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.519
even if you want a change, you shouldn't be delivering food.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.799
What's wrong with delivering food?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.439
I think delivering food is quite interesting.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.239
I'm in a hurry to deliver my next order.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.200
Don't block my way.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.480
Move aside.

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:41.920
Don't worry, I'll contact you if I need anything.

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.159
Let go of me! Who are you?

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.319
Song Haoyang, what do you want?

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:55.680
What do I want?

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.079
Su Qingyan.

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:59.000
Haven't you heard?

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:01.040
Any woman I, Song Haoyang, set my sights on

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.599
has never gotten away.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.120
This is kidnapping—it's a crime!

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:07.680
Here in Yuncheng,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.400
let alone kidnapping you,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.439
even if I forced myself on you,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.560
what could you do about it?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.199
Still trying to run?

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.560
Don't think you can escape from me again.

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.159
This is a special drug I got from abroad.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.680
Drink it—let's see if you can still pretend to be innocent.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.120
Grab her!

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:41.800
Yes!

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.680
Stop!

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:45.520
Don't run!

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.560
Catch her, quick!

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.599
Help me

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.680
Miss, what's wrong?

00:02:59.439 --> 00:02:59.960
Hurry

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.599
Go quickly

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.080
Take me away from here

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.039
Don't run

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.439
So hot

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:15.560
So hot

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:19.439
So hot

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.360
So hot

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.159
So hot.

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:56.039
So hot.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.079
You—who are you?

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.199
Why are you in my bed?

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:30.319
I actually wanted to go home and sleep.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.360
You didn't give me a chance.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.879
What did you do to me?

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.480
I didn't do anything.

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:41.879
You were the one doing things to me.

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.399
Shameless! Get off me, get off!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.879
You—

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.480
I can't believe you actually—

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:56.040
took my first time.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.639
Isn't it possible that—

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.399
your period just started?

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.480
I said I didn't do it on purpose. Do you believe me?

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:16.040
Get lost.

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.240
See? It really is my period.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.279
You remember now, right?

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.000
Last night, I tried my best to resist.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.759
But you still took advantage of me.

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:29.279
I almost lost my virginity.

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:30.439
Shut up. Don't say another word.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:35.879
The phone.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.720
Hello?

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.839
Su Qingyan, are you out of your mind?

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:45.639
It's an honor for our family that Young Master Song is willing to marry you.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.439
Not only are you not cooperating,

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:48.800
you even dared to injure Young Master Song.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.319
You must kneel and apologize to him.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.720
Apologize?

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.160
Uncle, do you even know what he did to me?

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.240
He drugged me.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.639
So what if he drugged you?

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:59.639
You're going to marry him sooner or later anyway.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.759
Whether you sleep with him sooner or later,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.120
what difference does it make?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.959
I really think you're out of your mind.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.439
Then I'm leaving.

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:11.319
Go ahead.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.680
Wait a minute.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.199
So alike. It's uncanny.

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:28.959
Alike in what way?

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.079
Let's get married.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.040
What?

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.800
So what you mean is

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.680
you want me to pretend to be Gao Feng

00:06:39.879 --> 00:06:40.600
and marry you?

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:41.560
That's right.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.800
But having me impersonate him

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.000
feels a bit strange to me.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.600
I understand your concerns.

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:51.839
Although you two do look somewhat alike,

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:55.439
Gao Feng is still a man of great status.

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:56.639
A real big shot.

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:58.079
You're just a food delivery guy.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.279
It's definitely a challenge for you to impersonate him.

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:02.040
But don't worry.

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:04.240
Gao Feng has always been very mysterious.

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:06.000
Very few people have seen what he really looks like.

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:07.720
As long as you do as I say,

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.079
I guarantee you won't be exposed.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.879
This is a temporary marriage agreement.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.920
It will last for six months.

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:14.199
After you sign it,

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:16.000
we'll appear to be husband and wife.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.879
But in reality, you'll just be my employee.

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:20.439
You must follow all my arrangements.

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:21.720
Play the role of Gao Feng well.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.439
Any problems?

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.839
No problem.

00:07:24.399 --> 00:07:25.639
It's a good job.

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:28.720
How's the pay?

00:07:30.279 --> 00:07:31.399
Fifty thousand a month.

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:32.480
If you do a good job,

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:33.279
there will be extra bonuses.

00:07:35.319 --> 00:07:37.000
I'm playing such an important person,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.319
and you only give me fifty thousand a month?

00:07:38.319 --> 00:07:39.639
Isn't that a bit stingy?

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.600
You only make five thousand a month delivering food.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.800
And you think fifty thousand is too little?

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.519
Five thousand is just for my performance.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.399
Selling myself is extra.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.720
So how much do you want?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:51.800
One hundred thousand a month.

00:07:51.959 --> 00:07:52.759
Non-negotiable.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.199
Alright.

00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:58.360
One hundred thousand it is.

00:07:58.639 --> 00:07:59.600
But—

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.439
I have three conditions.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.519
First, you must be available whenever I call.

00:08:04.519 --> 00:08:05.680
No skipping work without a valid reason.

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:07.399
Second,

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:10.439
You must follow my instructions in everything you say and do.

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:11.399
To avoid messing up the act.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.800
Third,

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:14.600
Even though we're married and technically a couple,

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.279
but—

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:16.920
No touching me.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.399
And no inappropriate thoughts.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.319
If you do have inappropriate thoughts about me,

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.959
you'll have to pay extra.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.839
Don't worry.

00:08:31.199 --> 00:08:32.600
If that day really comes,

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.200
I'll write my name, Su Qingyan, backwards.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:37.960
Come on.

00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.799
Hey, look at the camera.

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:41.039
Okay.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:42.600
Get a little closer.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.320
Miss,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.840
you're out of the frame.

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:49.759
Miss, move a bit closer.

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:50.919
You're taking wedding photos here.

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:52.039
Can you smile?

00:08:52.039 --> 00:08:53.080
You're about to get married.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:53.919
Why are you being so shy?

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.120
Come on.

00:08:57.399 --> 00:08:58.759
We agreed not to get handsy.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.240
It's a wedding photo shoot.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.639
If you're not a bit intimate, who will believe it?

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:03.159
Will your family believe it?

00:09:03.879 --> 00:09:04.919
Come on, relax.

00:09:06.279 --> 00:09:06.840
That's right.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.679
That's better.

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:08.840
Come on, give a smile.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.080
Okay.

00:09:11.399 --> 00:09:12.600
Change your pose, come on.

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:17.200
Let's take a sweet kissing photo.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.440
No way.

00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:19.879
It's a wedding photo shoot.

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:21.440
If you don't take a kissing photo, who will believe it?

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:23.200
Don't think I want to do this.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.279
It's all for the act.

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:26.759
At least kiss the cheek.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.600
I'll make another sacrifice.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:29.600
Come on.

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:31.840
Get ready.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.480
Okay.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.519
Look at the camera.

00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:34.519
Three.

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:35.480
Two.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:36.600
One.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.279
Honey

00:09:46.559 --> 00:09:47.240
Look

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.559
We look pretty good together in the photos

00:09:49.799 --> 00:09:51.200
Don't call me "honey" when no one's around

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.440
We're only in a fake marriage

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.399
I'm your boss

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:54.399
You're my employee

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:56.559
If you take advantage of me again like you did during the wedding photos

00:09:56.559 --> 00:09:57.960
Be careful or you won't get a single cent

00:09:58.279 --> 00:09:59.799
It's not like this is our first kiss

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:00.600
Aren't you—Shut up

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.200
Qingyan

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:19.320
These flowers are for you.

00:10:19.519 --> 00:10:20.639
Song Haoyang

00:10:20.879 --> 00:10:22.000
You still have the nerve to show up?

00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:24.480
What happened yesterday was my fault.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.960
But it's only because I love you too much.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.000
I just got a little impatient.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:27.639
How about this—

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.000
Just tell me what you want as compensation.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.399
I promise I'll do it.

00:10:32.039 --> 00:10:32.759
Fine.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.080
Then I want you to disappear from my sight right now.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.519
Just looking at you makes me sick.

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:38.480
Su Qingyan

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:39.840
Don't push your luck.

00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:41.519
You'll have to marry me sooner or later.

00:10:41.679 --> 00:10:42.720
Whether I sleep with you a day earlier

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.759
or a day later,

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.200
what difference does it make?

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.720
You're truly an animal.

00:10:47.879 --> 00:10:48.559
Where do you think you're going?

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:49.600
Let go of me!

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.279
I'm telling you,

00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:51.440
if I don't get you today,

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.639
I'll take your last name.

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:54.559
Song Haoyang, let go of me!

00:10:56.799 --> 00:10:57.600
You dare hit me?

00:10:57.759 --> 00:10:59.240
Do you know who I am, kid?

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.120
I know.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.320
Song Haoyang, the young master.

00:11:01.639 --> 00:11:02.519
You're exactly who I'm hitting.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.559
You two,

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.799
beat him to a pulp for me!

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:13.720
Let me tell you something.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:15.480
Our Song family is wealthy and powerful.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.320
We’re not to be messed with.

00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:17.720
Not to be messed with.

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:19.120
Not to be messed with, huh?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.679
Stop!

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.639
If you dare touch me,

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.879
our Song family will definitely make you

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:23.919
regret it for the rest of your life.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.840
Regret it for the rest of your life.

00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:26.120
Regret it for the rest of your life, huh?

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.000
Stop!

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.440
If you back off now,

00:11:28.799 --> 00:11:30.279
it’s still not too late.

00:11:30.679 --> 00:11:31.600
Not too late.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.480
Not too late, huh?

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:38.799
Big brother, big brother!

00:11:38.799 --> 00:11:39.480
Stop hitting me!

00:11:39.679 --> 00:11:39.960
I...

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.039
I won’t dare anymore.

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:42.159
Let me tell you,

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.039
Su Qingyan is already married to me.

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:45.799
If you dare bother her again,

00:11:45.799 --> 00:11:47.759
I’ll beat you so badly your own mother won’t recognize you.

00:11:47.759 --> 00:11:48.399
I won’t dare anymore.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:48.879
Get lost!

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.240
Kid!

00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:54.600
If you’ve got guts, tell me your name.

00:11:54.759 --> 00:11:56.759
I guarantee you won’t even have a grave to be buried in.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.320
Someone like you

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.679
isn’t worthy of knowing my name.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.840
But I’m in a good mood today.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.399
Honey, come here.

00:12:10.159 --> 00:12:10.720
Tell him

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.759
what my name is.

00:12:14.159 --> 00:12:15.279
My husband is

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:17.600
Gao Feng, the president of Junsheng Group.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:20.639
What?

00:12:20.639 --> 00:12:21.559
Gao... Gao Feng?

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:23.679
He... he's Gao Feng from Junsheng Group?

00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:25.519
Good, as long as you know to be afraid.

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.120
He and I are already legally married.

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.200
Don't bother me again.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:29.639
Let's go.

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:34.840
How was that?

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:36.799
I acted pretty well, right?

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:38.919
It was just okay.

00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:39.919
But...

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.360
Do you know the Song family is very powerful in Yuncheng?

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.279
If he comes to take revenge on you,

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:44.360
you'll be in real danger.

00:12:44.399 --> 00:12:45.480
You shouldn't have hit him like that.

00:12:45.879 --> 00:12:47.720
I'm the dignified president of Junsheng Group.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.720
Why would I be afraid of him?

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.200
You're not really Gao Feng.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.039
You're just pretending.

00:12:51.039 --> 00:12:52.279
You're just a delivery guy.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.240
Remember this.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.320
If something like this happens again,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.279
you can't be so impulsive.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.519
From now on, you'll sleep here.

00:13:07.519 --> 00:13:08.559
We've got the marriage certificate.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.559
So is the next step the wedding night?

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.679
Rule number three of our agreement:

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:14.360
No inappropriate thoughts about me.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.320
Fine, I won't.

00:13:16.519 --> 00:13:17.879
Anyway, last night was pretty much like a wedding night.

00:13:17.879 --> 00:13:18.399
Shut up.

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.559
Don't mention last night.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.120
So many photos of Gao Feng.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.279
Don't tell me you like Gao Feng.

00:13:35.399 --> 00:13:36.279
Don't talk nonsense.

00:13:37.519 --> 00:13:39.000
Gao Feng is a business tycoon.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.080
And he's compassionate.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.679
I just admire people like him.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.919
Actually, Gao Feng is just a person.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:44.919
There's nothing special about him.

00:13:45.159 --> 00:13:45.960
Hmph.

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:47.200
That's quite an attitude.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.320
Gao Feng is a business genius.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.279
What about you?

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:52.120
Just focus on delivering your food.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.879
I'm being kept by a rich woman now.

00:13:53.879 --> 00:13:54.679
I make a hundred thousand a month.

00:13:54.799 --> 00:13:55.919
Do I still need to deliver food?

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.559
You really have no ambition.

00:13:58.919 --> 00:13:59.840
Back in the day, Gao Feng

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.200
also worked his way up from the bottom.

00:14:01.639 --> 00:14:02.679
Unlike you.

00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:04.799
You just want an easy life and have no drive.

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:06.559
You're too kind, you're too kind.

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:07.600
I'm praising Gao Feng,

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.679
not you.

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.200
Don't get into character when you shouldn't.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.559
If you want to play Gao Feng well,

00:14:14.759 --> 00:14:16.360
looks alone aren't enough.

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:18.120
This contains his background information.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.440
Memorize all of it tonight.

00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:21.120
My acting is really good.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.559
I can just improvise.

00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:23.519
I don't need to memorize anything.

00:14:23.799 --> 00:14:25.279
Rule number two:

00:14:25.279 --> 00:14:27.159
You must follow my instructions in everything you do and say.

00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:28.120
Memorize it.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.840
Okay.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.639
Memorize it.

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:34.720
Recite

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:36.919
Reciting texts is also part of your job.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:38.200
I brought you here to work.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.519
Not to sleep.

00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:42.679
Happy

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.399
Just like a pig.
