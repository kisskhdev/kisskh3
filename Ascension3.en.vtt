How's the cultivation coming along?

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.410
You're asking too early.

It's not time yet.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.180

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.050
Since you lied to me first,

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.130
I see no reason to tell you the truth.

The power of Tier 5

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.890
that I've struggled to keep down,

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:29.130
why would I go through all this trouble?

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:33.420
Come on.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.130
Han Li.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.730
Today marks the end

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.700
of our master-disciple bond.

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.300
Show me what you've got.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.460
Let me see

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.770
what you've prepared.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:51.370
In less than three months,

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:58.820
you've already made this much progress.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:03.010
You really keep surprising me.

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.730
But my reputation

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:13.820
wasn't built

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:15.610
on medicine alone.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:36.180
Think you can take me on?

[Silver Demon Palm]
My signature technique,

returns to the world today.

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:31.340
Easy, my dear disciple.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.770
It'll all be over soon.

00:17:58.750 --> 00:18:00.650
You little brat!

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:04.100
Hiding tricks up your sleeve, huh?

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:26.700
You dared poison me?

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:28.820
You've got some nerve!

00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.140
"Hide cleverness with clumsiness."

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.050
You taught me that.

Armored Puppet!

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.700
"Hide cleverness with clumsiness."

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.180
That's what I taught you.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.140
Armored Puppet.

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.570
Stop struggling.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.940
He's a puppet I made myself.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.770
He only listens to me.

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.220
Relax,

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.250
Han Li.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.420
We were master and disciple, after all.

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:15.700
I won't let you suffer too much.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.090
Did you

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.730
do the same to Zhang Tie?

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.090
Take a guess.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.460
He saw you as a second father,

00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:29.090
and you still harmed him?

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.810
I had no choice.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:35.810
He didn't have a spirit root.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.380
And

00:21:38.590 --> 00:21:40.460
he couldn't practice the Longevity Art.

00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:43.010
So to me,

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.420
he was useless.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.940
Mo Juren!

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:54.010
Stop wasting time talking to him.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.380
Do it now!

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:56.700
What's the rush?

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:00.220
At this point,

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.050
as long as your Seven Ghost Soul-Devouring Curse works,

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.050
he's not going anywhere.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.530
Who are you talking to?

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.570
Whose voice is that?

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.220
Don't be afraid.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:07.660
Don't resist.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.660
Just enjoy

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:14.490
this grand feast I've spent years preparing.

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.570
I can hardly wait

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.530
the thrill of rebirth.

Take a look.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:02.860
This is what I used to look like.

00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:13.570
No need to be scared.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.090
It won't hurt that much!

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:17.770
Relax.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.050

All that you've achieved

00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:46.900
won't be in vain!

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:48.940
Everything you are

How is he breaking free?

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.980
Didn't you say I could possess him

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:15.860
with your curse?

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.380
The mantra I gave you

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.050
only holds four tiers power.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:21.570
But he's

also reached Tier 4.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.010
So basically,

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.050
you wanted me and him

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.530
to wear each other down,

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.460
so you could swoop in and take over?

What do you think?

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:35.730
You sly little snake.

I won't let you take him.

He's my disciple!

You truly are my worthy disciple.

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:47.330
It's come to this.

Got anything else to say?

00:28:56.350 --> 00:28:57.180
No.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:09.570
Nothing at all.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.700
That man just now

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:15.700
is named Yu Zitong.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.860
Once you're out,

don't believe a word he says.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:22.010
Kill him immediately.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.050
A primordial spirit's weakest point is poison.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.980
Use what you used on me.

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:30.490
That's enough.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:32.490
Also,

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.220
he fears the light.

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:45.810
Goodbye,

Master.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:26.460
And you?

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.220
Got anything left to say?

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.180
My name is Yu Zitong.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.090
I come from a cultivator clan.

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.700
You're a cultivator,

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.250
and well-connected.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:42.010
Got it.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.220
If you

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:46.290
help me find another body

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.330
so I can start over,

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:49.490
I will, in return,

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.860
recommend you to my clan!

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.860
Don't believe a word he says.

00:31:54.510 --> 00:31:56.090
Kill him immediately.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:57.980
A soul's weakest point is poison.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:02.090
Use what you used on me.

00:32:04.110 --> 00:32:05.050
In the world of cultivation,

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.490
everything becomes easier

00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:07.810
with a strong clan behind you!

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:09.420
How does that sound?

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.010
You said the same thing

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:15.730
to Physician Mo, didn't you?

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.380
That lowly mortal,

00:32:18.750 --> 00:32:20.700
how could he ever compare to us?

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:24.660
Fair point.

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.420
But he asked me to give you something.

00:32:36.350 --> 00:32:36.810
Get lost!

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.980
Come out.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:55.420
Show yourself!

00:33:11.070 --> 00:33:11.770
Also,

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.380
he fears the light.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:18.490
Let me out!

00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:19.700
What are you doing?

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.090
Let me out!

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.490
Let me out now!

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.620
Whatever happened between you and Physician Mo,

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.980
I couldn't care less.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.490
I just want to stay alive.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:45.810
I don't hurt others,

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.330
and I won't let others hurt me!

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.220
Without Physician Mo's command,

00:34:19.720 --> 00:34:20.490
this guy

00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:22.090
is totally still.

00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:05.860
This place

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:08.180
should suit your tastes.

00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:10.460
No one will bother you here,

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:12.860
because no one knows

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.810
you're no longer alive.

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:18.250
Master,

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.330
just rest here,

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.700
in peace.

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:39.250
You old bastard,

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.140
you won't let me go even in death.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.210
Disciple Han Li,

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:58.300
if you're reading this letter,

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:00.740

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.070
- Great! - Great!

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.130
Master Jia.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:34.690
Where are you heading?

00:49:36.590 --> 00:49:37.420
Master,

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:38.740
let's talk this through.

00:49:39.670 --> 00:49:41.530
I've got no quarrel with you.

00:49:41.840 --> 00:49:42.940
If you'd just spare me,

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:43.940
I'd gladly

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.590
reward you handsomely!

00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:52.530
You've killed countless innocents.

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.650
Ever think this day would come?

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.340
I might spare the others,

00:49:59.000 --> 00:49:59.650
but you...

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.610
You're the one I'll never forgive.

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.380
Will you take your own life

00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:08.610
or shall I do it for you?

00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:12.740
Everyone of the Wild Wolves Gang!

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.940
Kill!

00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:18.490
Kill him!

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:19.780
Charge!

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:21.050
Kill him!

00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.170
I'm dead either way...

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:30.740
Master!

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.380
Master, you saved the sect today.

00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:49.050
I owe you a great debt.

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:51.530
How would you like to be repaid?

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.340
I'll give you the position of Deputy Sect Master,

00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:58.980
one thousand taels of silver.

00:50:59.550 --> 00:51:01.820
And all elders and disciples will obey your orders.

00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:03.260
But,

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.820
only after I pass away,

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:06.210
the sect

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:07.300
will finally be yours.

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.780
What do you say?

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.260
Why don't you first call off the ambush

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:19.900
hiding out?

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:38.210
They were probably

00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:39.690
put there by Elder Zhang.

00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:42.650
Master,

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.860
I meant no disrespect.

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:47.340
As sect leader,

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.900
there are things I simply can't control.

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:50.820
When you found

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:51.820
your own sect,

00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:53.090
you'll understand.

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:56.940
Don't worry, Master Wang.

00:51:57.440 --> 00:51:58.170
I won't

00:51:58.590 --> 00:51:59.460
be staying for long.

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:01.940
After today,

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:04.260
I'll be gone for good.

00:52:05.070 --> 00:52:06.170
But before I go,

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:07.940
there's a deal

00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:09.010
I'd like to strike,

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:10.860
one that benefits both of us.

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:13.670
Of course. No problem.

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.940
You haven't even heard my terms yet.

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:22.940
Please, go ahead.

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:26.980
Take Li Feiyu as your final disciple.

00:52:27.440 --> 00:52:27.860
Besides,

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.840
appoint him as head of the Outer Blade Hall.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:34.380
Done.

00:52:35.230 --> 00:52:36.050
Anything else?

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:40.420
He's in love with Elder Zhang's third daughter, Zhang Xiu'er.

00:52:41.550 --> 00:52:43.170
But Elder Zhang disapproves because he's poor.

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:44.570
I'll talk to him.

00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:45.420
It's not a big deal.

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:46.570
Anything else?

00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.170
I have a third uncle.

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:51.900
He's just an outer disciple.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:53.530
He was the one

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:55.570
who brought me to the Seven Mysteries Sect.

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.010
If something happens to him later,

00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:59.300
- I hope you'll take care of him. - Of course.

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:00.260
No problem at all.

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:04.940
As for me,

00:53:05.230 --> 00:53:06.610
I won't let you go unrewarded.

00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:09.530
This one

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.740
is a rare treasure, the Essence Pill.

00:53:12.070 --> 00:53:12.780
Keep it.

00:53:13.110 --> 00:53:14.170
It might just save your life

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:15.490
in a critical moment.

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.770
I got everything you've said.

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:24.360
I accept it all.

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:26.340
