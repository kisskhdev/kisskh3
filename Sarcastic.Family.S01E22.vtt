WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.799
The plating looks okay.

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:06.640
But the taste is weak.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.719
You’re taking this wedding way too seriously.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.080
Look it over again.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.599
Sis…

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.039
You made a whole book for tasting?

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:20.680
Of course not.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.120
Vol. One, Two, Three.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.280
Three volumes in total.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.159
Three.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.800
What’s wrong with that?

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.280
I only marry once.

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:30.800
It has to be perfect.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.240
Right, right, it must be perfect.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.080
It has to be perfect.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.240
Sis, future brother‑in‑law,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.240
for your wedding,

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:37.840
I have to be deeply involved.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.879
About my proposal last time,

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:40.840
what do you think?

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:45.199
The best man…

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.520
has to be Lao Cha.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.080
I met your sister

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.719
kind of because of him.

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:51.800
What about my other idea?

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.199
Me in drag as a bridesmaid.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:55.960
Not really suitable.

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.599
True.

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:58.520
My looks, after all,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.840
might steal your spotlight.

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:02.319
Any other ideas?

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.479
The emcee.

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:05.319
Emcee is fine.

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:06.199
Thanks, bro‑in‑law.

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.680
The planner from the wedding company’s here.

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.000
I’ll go meet them.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.319
Where are you now?

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:14.680
I’m in the lobby.

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.639
You brought all the plans and stuff, right?

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:17.599
Okay.

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:19.639
Have you picked the host yet?

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.719
Thanks.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:27.520
You’re welcome.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.000
Sis,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.560
you really love carbs, huh?

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.039
This is the staple I planned

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.919
for the wedding, my own creation.

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:39.240
Nine‑grid boiled instant noodles.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.919
Don’t tell your fiancé.

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.159
It’s just instant noodles.

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.280
What’s so special about that?

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.000
You don’t get it.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:46.599
I really don’t.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.520
I finally gained a big sis,

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.439
but at your wedding

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:50.919
I have zero presence.

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:54.599
Then how about this—

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.280
you prepare a little fun act.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.479
You think I don’t want to?

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:01.560
I wanted to hitch onto one.

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:03.599
But where would I hitch on?

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:34.959
Oh right, Sis—

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.879
I’ve never actually heard

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.639
how you and he met.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.879
The two of us…

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.240
The two of us…

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.240
first met at—

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.920
Let me guess.

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:45.639
Under an eave, hiding from rain?

00:04:46.079 --> 00:04:47.199
Or in a library,

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:48.720
grabbing the same book?

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:49.519
Sis,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.240
don’t tell me it was on a bridge,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.439
you brushed past each other,

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:53.639
and one glance felt eternal?

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.399
At a bar.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.240
The beginning of this story

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:59.639
is kind of cliché.

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:02.000
Cliché?

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:16.079
Is this how young people

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.639
all approach work now?

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:20.079
What was Earth’s last rating?

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:21.399
Three and a half stars.

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.199
And your proposed rating?

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.439
Destruction.

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:25.560
Are you serious?

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:26.800
After just two and a half years,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.399
you give me that research result?

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.120
You’re still on probation.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.319
Whether you get confirmed,

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:32.360
or promoted to senior,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.000
depends on your own performance.

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:35.079
Chief Editor, it’s not that—

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:36.079
I’ve been on probation this whole time.

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.720
How long have I been on probation?

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:46.959
You just have to drink.

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:48.319
You need to exercise more.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.879
Without alcohol, you feel empty.

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:50.639
You know what I mean?

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:51.759
You just gotta drink.

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.199
Stop looking around.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.279
Sit down.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.639
Listen to me.

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:57.639
Sit, sit, sit.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.680
These past few years on Earth...

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:02.319
have seen big changes.

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:04.959
You need to stay there.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.680
to conduct deeper investigations.

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:09.279
After you return,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.639
you'll be promoted to senior editor immediately.

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.160
Whether you get a permanent position,

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.240
or a salary raise,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.439
depends entirely on your performance.

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:18.560
Do you know what this behavior

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.040
is called on Earth?

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.160
Psychological manipulation.

00:06:22.759 --> 00:06:23.800
People like me

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.680
on Earth

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.240
are called corporate slaves.

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.759
We're not even considered human.

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:31.079
What's so great about him?

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:32.360
Right.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.879
What's so special about him?

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:38.600
He's just a boss.

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:43.360
Yeah.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.079
The kind who just sits in the office all day

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:47.360
doing nothing.

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:49.959
The boss just flaps his lips,

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:52.279
and we have to run our legs off.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.279
Here.

00:07:03.079 --> 00:07:03.839
Cheers.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.319
Uh...

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.319
I need to discuss something with you.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.000
Because right now,

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:18.800
my understanding of scumbags

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:20.839
isn't very thorough yet.

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:23.439
Could you provide me some material?

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:25.439
Share your thought process and such.

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:30.199
I'm not a scumbag.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.720
If you're not a scumbag, what are you?

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.560
It's you.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:36.360
Scumbag.

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.360
Let's go.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.519
Go.

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:45.360
What am I?

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.639
Doesn't matter.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.959
But I know

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:50.319
what you are.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.800
What am I?

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:57.120
You're an angel

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.959
sent to Earth

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:04.079
from another galaxy.

00:08:12.399 --> 00:08:13.680
He... he's

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:14.680
drunk.

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.560
Happens every day.

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:19.920
Here.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.040
Look at this.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.519
This menu is hilarious.

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:37.080
There's one called Wormhole Fruit Platter.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.120
When they bring out the fruit platter,

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.120
it's full of worm-eaten holes.

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.240
There's another one.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.960
It's called Pandora Noodles.

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.600
What do you think you're doing?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.159
What do you think you're doing?

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:56.240
I'm warning you.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.080
Put away your shameless male gaze.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.919
If you harass

00:09:00.919 --> 00:09:02.519
this dignified lady again,

00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:03.759
don't blame me for what happens next.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.120
I didn't do anything.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:05.720
Go.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.000
Disappear.

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:08.320
Get out of here.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.120
Okay.

00:09:09.519 --> 00:09:10.519
I'll... I'll get going then.

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:10.919
Go.

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:13.879
So outrageous.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.600
I just couldn't stand by and watch.

00:09:17.879 --> 00:09:20.200
He's the absolute scum of all men.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.559
Hello.

00:09:24.559 --> 00:09:25.159
Hello.

00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:26.519
Look...

00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:28.919
It's my first time in a place like this.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.240
I feel like I don't really fit in.

00:09:31.799 --> 00:09:33.600
Can I buy you a drink?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
We could talk.

00:09:36.039 --> 00:09:37.519
I have... I have my own.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.679
Bartender!

00:09:38.799 --> 00:09:40.879
Another one of the same for the lady.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:41.960
My card...

00:09:42.679 --> 00:09:43.639
It's right here.

00:09:43.639 --> 00:09:44.320
No, wait.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.200
What's right here?

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.360
I thought I lost it.

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:48.240
Didn't I tell you to disappear?

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.240
What are you doing?

00:09:50.039 --> 00:09:50.600
You...

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:55.840
These are new!

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.759
I'm disappearing! I'm disappearing!

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.639
I never thought you almost got together
with Lao Cha.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.120
I didn't expect it either.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.240
Turns out I'm both of their type.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.639
Anyway, my first impression of Meng Hang

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:13.960
wasn't very good.

00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:16.720
Our love story

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.000
That's right.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.240
We need to fully understand

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.759
the client's emotional experience.

00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:21.080
Then

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.039
we can provide you

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:23.879
with the most precise wedding planning.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.679
So please tell us

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:27.159
how you two met.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.240
Back then,

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:32.399
I didn't have much dating experience.

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:35.960
Once, after a class reunion

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.200
was over,

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:41.039
Lao Cha took me to a bar.

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:42.039
Come on, let's go.

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:44.279
You have to drink.

00:10:44.399 --> 00:10:45.639
You need more practice.

00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:47.200
If you don't drink, you'll feel empty.

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:47.960
You know that, right?

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.080
You just have to drink.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.559
Stop looking around.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.559
Sit down.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:52.960
Trust me.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.000
Sit, sit, sit.

00:10:57.039 --> 00:10:57.519
How is it?

00:10:58.039 --> 00:10:58.720
This place—

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:01.440
Bottoms up, bottoms up, let's go.

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:06.679
Take a deep sip.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.000
What's wrong?

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.440
It's my first time in a place like this.

00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:17.399
I always feel out of place.

00:11:18.399 --> 00:11:19.639
You've had quite a bit already.

00:11:19.639 --> 00:11:20.679
Maybe I should head home.

00:11:20.679 --> 00:11:21.440
Sit tight.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.320
That's exactly why

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.879
you're still single.

00:11:25.399 --> 00:11:26.240
Let me tell you,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:27.480
dating

00:11:27.639 --> 00:11:28.879
is like leveling up an account.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.840
You have to play more.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.240
That's how you go from bronze to king.

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:34.279
Don't worry.

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:36.080
I'll be your wingman tonight.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.360
I'll pick two for you.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.200
Look.

00:11:39.759 --> 00:11:40.879
There are two right there.

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:42.240
They're pure and pretty.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:42.600
Really.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.799
I'll take you to try them out.

00:11:43.799 --> 00:11:44.679
Keep it down.

00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:45.240
Let's go.

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.240
Try, try them out.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:46.720
Go, go, go.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.480
Isn't this a bit much?

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:47.960
You go ahead.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:48.559
Bro.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.440
Hi, beautiful.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.240
Can you—

00:11:55.159 --> 00:11:56.039
Lao Cha.

00:11:57.679 --> 00:11:59.080
That cheating friend of yours

00:11:59.159 --> 00:11:59.840
is him.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.240
That's your side account.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.440
Stop with the nonsense.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.360
What side account?

00:12:05.919 --> 00:12:07.279
They're two real-life angels.

00:12:07.279 --> 00:12:08.200
You call them side accounts?

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.039
Do you have any manners?

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:11.240
Honey.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:11.960
It's him.

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:13.279
It's him.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.399
He taught me.

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:14.840
What?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.200
Dating is like leveling up an account.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:17.039
Open more side accounts to gain experience.

00:12:17.039 --> 00:12:18.200
I honestly don't know what it means.

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.360
He taught me all of it.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:19.679
I—

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.799
I didn't say that.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.440
It was you.

00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:25.039
Jerk.

00:12:26.519 --> 00:12:27.159
Let's go.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:29.559
Go.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.639
Your alt account is this good too

00:12:39.919 --> 00:12:41.000
Old Meng, I was wrong

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:41.679
I just...

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:43.039
Just take it as me owing you one, okay?

00:12:43.039 --> 00:12:43.759
I'm really sorry

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.519
Just...

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:45.799
I don't wanna play with you anymore

00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:46.399
No no no

00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:48.080
Right now I...

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.000
Really wanna go home

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.559
Not going home

00:12:49.559 --> 00:12:50.480
Pac-Man, Pac-Man, Pac-Man

00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:52.240
Go go go

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:53.759
Let's drink

00:12:53.759 --> 00:12:54.759
Don't be mad

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.840
Be good and drink

00:13:02.559 --> 00:13:03.279
No, I...

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.240
Bro Meng, don't do this...

00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:07.759
Learned it... from my dad

00:13:08.639 --> 00:13:10.720
Only had... a few drinks and you're like this

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.399
We still got round two later, Bro Meng

00:13:14.039 --> 00:13:15.039
I feel sick

00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:15.879
You don't... no...

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:16.679
You don't... you don't...

00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:17.279
Behave yourself

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:18.279
No way... that...

00:13:19.559 --> 00:13:21.279
There's someone over there

00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:22.480
Drinking alone

00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:24.399
Perfect for rookies like you to practice

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.799
Look... look behind you

00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:26.720
One o'clock position

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.600
One o'clock, turn

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.960
That one o'clock position

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.000
Stop messing around

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:37.840
She's been sitting alone since she came in

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:39.759
Go give it a try

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:40.639
You'll do fine

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:42.399
These past few years on Earth...

00:13:42.399 --> 00:13:44.039
Changed a lot

00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:45.759
I... I can't

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.639
What do you mean can't?

00:13:46.879 --> 00:13:48.519
A man should never say he can't

00:13:49.519 --> 00:13:50.639
Just treat it as chatting

00:13:50.639 --> 00:13:52.519
Improve your communication skills, okay?

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:53.360
We salespeople...

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.279
Need to communicate

00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:56.879
Fine

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:57.440
Okay

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.559
I can do it

00:13:58.559 --> 00:13:59.320
You're the best

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.120
She...

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:00.639
Alright

00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:02.120
No...

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.519
You know what this behavior

00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:04.879
is called on Earth?

00:14:05.679 --> 00:14:06.960
Gaslighting

00:14:07.639 --> 00:14:09.759
People like me on Earth

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.240
Are called corporate slaves

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.879
Not even considered human

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:16.159
What's so great about him?

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.080
Right

00:14:17.559 --> 00:14:18.919
Just a boss, that's all

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.919
What's so special about him?

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:21.919
Exactly

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:24.679
The kind who just sits in the office

00:14:24.679 --> 00:14:25.799
Doing nothing all day

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
The boss just needs to say a word

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:30.360
And we break our backs working

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.639
Cheers

00:14:37.759 --> 00:14:39.559
If you're not a jerk, what are you?

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.240
What am I?

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.440
Doesn't matter

00:14:44.639 --> 00:14:45.720
But I know

00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:47.039
What you are

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.600
You're an angel

00:14:50.559 --> 00:14:52.399
Sent to Earth

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.159
From another galaxy

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.480
You're an angel

00:15:00.679 --> 00:15:01.320
You're drunk

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.000
People like this every day

00:15:03.679 --> 00:15:05.200
But about that reevaluation...

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.919
Hope you'll go easy on me

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:07.759
Right now I'm...

00:15:07.879 --> 00:15:09.200
Counting on this little shop

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.200
Alright alright

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.000
I got it

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:13.919
Go do your work

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:23.879
Buddy

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.879
This shop...

00:15:26.039 --> 00:15:26.919
Belongs to her

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.799
Why this shop?

00:15:28.879 --> 00:15:30.600
All shops worldwide depend on her

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:33.960
Thanks

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.919
Worldwide

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.600
And th-there's another one called

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:45.840
Pandora Noodles.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.720
Pretty interesting.

00:15:51.759 --> 00:15:53.440
What are you doing? What are you doing?

00:15:54.279 --> 00:15:56.200
Rich lady, let me take over.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:57.960
What are you doing?

00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.080
Quit that shameless male gaze now.

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:01.799
Come on.

00:16:02.159 --> 00:16:02.759
Move, quick.

00:16:08.159 --> 00:16:09.559
I really can't take it anymore.

00:16:09.879 --> 00:16:11.559
He's a disgrace to all men.

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:14.080
Hi.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.000
It's my first time in a place like this.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.960
May I buy you a drink?

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.440
Boss.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.519
Same again for this lady.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.120
Wait a second.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:23.879
My card...

00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:25.360
Here it is.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.039
No.

00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:27.000
What's “here it is”?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.320
I thought I'd lost it.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.080
Didn't I make you disappear?

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:31.080
What are you doing?

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:32.399
You—

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:34.840
Anyway…

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.600
I was totally out of it then,

00:16:36.919 --> 00:16:38.919
no memory of Lili at all.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.759
Then with brother‑in‑law's drinking,

00:16:42.759 --> 00:16:43.919
what do we do at the wedding?

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.320
It's fine.

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:47.279
Old Zha owes him a favor, right?

00:16:47.519 --> 00:16:49.279
He promised to drink for him.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.320
Anyway,

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:53.360
the second time I met Meng Hang,

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.600
I realized he really

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.080
didn’t remember the bar at all.

00:16:56.639 --> 00:16:57.360
He blacked out.

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:58.679
So your second encounter,

00:16:58.679 --> 00:17:00.159
had to be somewhere romantic, right?

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.039
A trash pile.

00:17:06.079 --> 00:17:06.839
That day,

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.000
my fever was nearly forty.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:13.880
On my way back from the pharmacy,

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.640
I saw a man

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:19.279
skulking around

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:21.000
by the trash pile,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.119
brandishing a brick.

00:17:24.559 --> 00:17:26.440
He was covered in blood

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:29.720
and tossed down a bloody rag.

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.400
When I looked back again,

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.519
the man was gone.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.880
Right after that,

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.759
I passed out.

00:18:02.839 --> 00:18:04.039
When I opened my eyes,

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.440
I was in a tiny dark room.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:44.920
I know—

00:18:45.039 --> 00:18:45.920
you were taken hostage.

00:18:46.319 --> 00:18:47.240
Then brother‑in‑law showed up,

00:18:47.359 --> 00:18:48.279
heroically saving the damsel.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.599
Sort of.

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:52.839
Just one tiny twist.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.440
The guy who “took me hostage”

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:58.559
was actually Meng Hang.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.880
Actually that night

00:19:01.119 --> 00:19:03.720
I was going to fight our ex‑boss.

00:19:04.519 --> 00:19:06.200
That was our previous company,

00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:08.200
a shady employment agency.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.279
He had you call property

00:19:10.279 --> 00:19:11.200
to cut their water and power.

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:11.960
How did it go?

00:19:12.759 --> 00:19:13.440
Boss,

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.839
I don’t think this is right.

00:19:16.599 --> 00:19:18.519
The lease isn’t even up yet.

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:21.119
I checked the tenant’s place today.

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:22.559
Someone splashed paint on the door,

00:19:23.119 --> 00:19:24.599
wrote a huge “Get out” on it.

00:19:24.599 --> 00:19:25.960
I spent ages scrubbing it off.

00:19:26.279 --> 00:19:27.960
Why would you scrub it off?

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.920
I paid someone to do that.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.279
Isn’t this going too far?

00:19:36.079 --> 00:19:37.559
How about I go apologize to them?

00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:39.599
At least return their deposit

00:19:39.599 --> 00:19:40.960
and their rent, right?

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.039
True.

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.079
Refund it and be done.

00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:44.240
Okay.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.079
I mean I’ll refund you and be done.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.000
You’re useless, can’t do a thing right.

00:19:49.279 --> 00:19:50.559
A broke loser like you dares

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:51.920
to act like some moral model.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:52.960
Get the hell out of here.

00:20:09.359 --> 00:20:10.359
Damn boss

00:20:11.119 --> 00:20:12.720
I really want to smack you dead

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:13.720
I

00:20:15.079 --> 00:20:15.599
I

00:20:16.359 --> 00:20:18.279
I was so angry at that moment

00:20:19.119 --> 00:20:21.319
Picked up a brick from the trash pile

00:20:22.079 --> 00:20:24.519
Went to settle scores with my ex-boss

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.319
Just you wait

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.519
At that time

00:20:28.759 --> 00:20:30.319
A girl fainted

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.359
When I went over

00:20:33.559 --> 00:20:34.880
She had a high fever

00:20:36.039 --> 00:20:36.920
Coincidentally

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:38.559
Nearby

00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:40.160
I had just taken over

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:41.519
An empty rental apartment

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:43.519
So I took her there

00:20:47.599 --> 00:20:48.559
Don't come near me

00:20:48.759 --> 00:20:50.440
Come closer and I'll beat you dead

00:20:50.559 --> 00:20:51.359
You're awake

00:20:52.359 --> 00:20:53.359
Don't get me wrong

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.799
I told you not to

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:55.839
I said don't come closer

00:21:00.599 --> 00:21:01.319
What are you doing

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:09.079
You're that guy from the bar

00:21:10.359 --> 00:21:12.680
Did you hold a grudge against me

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:14.079
And followed me here

00:21:14.759 --> 00:21:15.599
The bar

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.680
Do we know each other

00:21:20.079 --> 00:21:22.319
How forgetful you important people are

00:21:24.759 --> 00:21:25.720
I said don't come closer

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.720
What are you...

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:28.720
What are you doing

00:21:30.519 --> 00:21:31.519
Drink this first

00:21:33.519 --> 00:21:34.319
What is it

00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.359
Cold medicine

00:21:41.079 --> 00:21:42.480
I bought it myself, don't worry

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:00.759
Well...

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.559
I'm really sorry

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.960
I'm just overly cautious

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.599
No no no

00:22:06.359 --> 00:22:08.160
I should be the one apologizing

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:09.519
About...

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:12.319
That day at the bar...

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.599
Was I really that awful

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.519
Did I harass you

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.759
Not exactly harassment

00:22:20.359 --> 00:22:22.319
So you don't need to apologize

00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:24.599
It was your friend

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:25.319
All his fault

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.119
He's such a jerk

00:22:27.599 --> 00:22:28.640
If I see him again

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.720
I'll beat him up for you

00:22:31.039 --> 00:22:32.960
Or call him over now

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.480
While I'm still feverish

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:35.839
I'll give him my virus

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.720
Well... I...

00:22:43.839 --> 00:22:45.599
With such high fever

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.319
Why are you out alone

00:22:47.519 --> 00:22:48.880
Your parents aren't with you

00:22:51.079 --> 00:22:51.720
Well...

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.359
My dad passed early

00:22:54.079 --> 00:22:55.480
My mom...

00:22:56.119 --> 00:22:57.200
Is gone too

00:23:02.279 --> 00:23:03.079
I'm sorry

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.079
Touched a sore spot

00:23:05.559 --> 00:23:06.640
It's okay

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:07.480
Doesn't hurt much

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.000
That's good

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.160
That's good

00:23:13.119 --> 00:23:15.160
I haven't asked your name

00:23:15.599 --> 00:23:16.240
Meng Hang

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:17.759
Meng Hang

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:18.799
And you

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.400
I'm Li Lili

00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:21.480
What

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.279
Li... Li... Li

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.519
Hard to say if you have a lisp

00:23:27.519 --> 00:23:28.319
Li Lili

00:23:34.319 --> 00:23:34.799
Well...

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.839
In our line of

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.480
work, our phones

00:23:37.839 --> 00:23:39.240
all burn through power fast.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.000
So just now it died and

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.400
I couldn't call 120 for you.

00:23:43.119 --> 00:23:43.880
It's okay.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.640
W-what line of work are you in?

00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:47.960
I'm a

00:23:48.119 --> 00:23:48.960
real estate agent.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:52.519
That's nice.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.160
Nice how?

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.319
It's so ordinary.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.440
Ordinary is great.

00:23:57.599 --> 00:23:59.240
I just want to be an ordinary person.

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:00.640
You're already very ordinary now.

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:01.400
Really?

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.000
No.

00:24:03.119 --> 00:24:03.920
Not ordinary.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:05.680
No—

00:24:06.359 --> 00:24:06.880
that's not

00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:09.880
what I mean.

00:24:10.079 --> 00:24:11.480
You're just... weird.

00:24:12.759 --> 00:24:13.680
Weirdly ordinary.

00:24:23.799 --> 00:24:25.880
I've studied quite a few earthlings.

00:24:27.599 --> 00:24:28.480
Earthlings—

00:24:29.599 --> 00:24:31.279
that's a very big-picture term.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.200
I like it.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.359
Humans, I mean.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.480
They really love to compare.

00:24:39.279 --> 00:24:40.400
You compare with him.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.480
He compares with that guy.

00:24:41.519 --> 00:24:42.799
Round and round comparing,

00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:43.920
no one is satisfied.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.720
No one's happy.

00:24:45.799 --> 00:24:47.839
But after I've met so

00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:50.400
many different kinds of samples,

00:24:51.079 --> 00:24:52.119
I realized

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.640
some things you think

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.880
are totally ordinary,

00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:56.680
totally unremarkable,

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.880
are what others desperately want.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.400
So I think

00:25:00.559 --> 00:25:02.079
for an ordinary person,

00:25:02.279 --> 00:25:03.480
having a job

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.920
and a family

00:25:05.359 --> 00:25:06.839
is already pretty great.

00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:12.279
Here.

00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:14.119
There's only this one bowl.

00:25:15.119 --> 00:25:15.880
Make do with it.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.079
Thanks.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:19.480
Here.

00:25:25.839 --> 00:25:27.119
This is insanely good.

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.240
How did you make it?

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.799
You've never had instant noodles?

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:34.359
Only the dry kind.

00:25:36.519 --> 00:25:37.519
I've got

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:40.640
a little trick for cooking them.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.839
Use this secret and it tastes amazing.

00:25:46.079 --> 00:25:47.119
So where are you

00:25:47.359 --> 00:25:48.160
going later?

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.880
I'll walk you there.

00:25:58.119 --> 00:25:59.279
Isn't that a bit fast?

00:26:00.119 --> 00:26:01.079
I live right here.

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.640
It's nice and cheap.

00:26:04.599 --> 00:26:05.640
So I misunderstood you.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:10.880
Otherwise...

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.319
I can help you find a place.

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:19.720
Or...

00:26:20.119 --> 00:26:21.799
make me another bowl first.

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:23.079
Sure.

00:26:25.559 --> 00:26:27.000
After that night,

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.000
I really felt

00:26:29.359 --> 00:26:31.160
everything wasn't so hard anymore.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.359
What do you mean?

00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:35.039
At least I learned to cook instant noodles.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.680
In a way,

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.839
Meng Hang saved me when I was down.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.279
Actually that night,

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.920
Lili saved me from making a mistake.

00:26:54.359 --> 00:26:55.279
Thank you.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.079
Thanks for letting me take some

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.400
and writing the noodle secret down.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:03.279
It's under the bowl.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.400
Read it when you can.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.079
Thanks.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.200
Well...

00:27:08.599 --> 00:27:09.160
goodbye.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:10.960
Goodbye.

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:21.839
I've always had a pretty

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.119
negative view of earthlings.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.519
But I think

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.759
you're a good person.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.039
Later I reported that shady agent.

00:27:43.319 --> 00:27:44.680
Through Lao Cha’s introduction,

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.400
I joined the company I’m in now.

00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:47.559
Later Meng Hang

00:27:47.559 --> 00:27:50.000
really did find me a nice place.

00:27:50.359 --> 00:27:51.839
It’s that tiny place from the night

00:27:51.839 --> 00:27:52.799
the two of us first met.

00:27:53.799 --> 00:27:54.920
Once I finished tidying it up,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.240
it actually felt pretty great.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.039
After that,

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.640
I finally worked up the courage

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.279
to ask her out for a meal.

00:28:03.799 --> 00:28:04.519
Table twenty‑seven, right?

00:28:04.519 --> 00:28:05.599
Afternoon tea is half price.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.039
So we met up there.

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:41.599
I thought

00:28:41.759 --> 00:28:43.200
it would be like in the movies,

00:28:43.319 --> 00:28:45.000
we’d talk and talk, never run out.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.839
We’d have endless things to do.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.160
But in the end…

00:29:07.559 --> 00:29:08.960
How’s that place? Living there okay?

00:29:12.079 --> 00:29:12.799
Um…

00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:15.720
ten minutes ago

00:29:16.359 --> 00:29:17.720
I literally just answered that.

00:29:18.839 --> 00:29:19.680
It’s fine.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.839
How’s your new job?

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.839
Pretty good?

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.759
I’ve answered that three times too.

00:29:32.279 --> 00:29:33.119
It’s good.

00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.440
Good is good then.

00:29:46.799 --> 00:29:48.160
Look at those two.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.000
Are they breaking up or what?

00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:51.240
Baby,

00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:53.640
it’s so obvious, can’t you see?

00:29:54.039 --> 00:29:55.319
They’re on a forced blind date.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.319
See?

00:29:56.559 --> 00:29:57.400
Totally not into each other.

00:29:57.759 --> 00:29:58.880
Not like the two of us.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.519
Right?

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:01.519
Here.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:06.400
So sweet.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:15.680
How about

00:30:15.799 --> 00:30:16.680
we help them

00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.319
and do their homework a bit?

00:30:24.359 --> 00:30:24.839
Okay.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.559
Sure.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.960
Yeah, yeah, sure.

00:31:03.839 --> 00:31:04.480
Let’s go.

00:31:05.319 --> 00:31:06.920
How about I give them more questions?

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.000
Like the Riemann hypothesis, you know.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.839
So we can work on them together.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:33.839
I’m done for.

00:31:33.839 --> 00:31:34.880
It’s over.

00:31:35.119 --> 00:31:37.400
Li Lili, you’ve studied this so long,

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.240
watched so many romance dramas—

00:31:39.519 --> 00:31:41.759
why do you blank out on the test?

00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:45.319
Meng Hang, you practiced ten tongue twisters

00:31:45.319 --> 00:31:46.319
and five comic rap bits before coming—

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.599
how can you still not talk like a human?

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.000
No.

00:31:51.599 --> 00:31:53.240
I can’t let it end like this.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.000
Um…

00:32:15.559 --> 00:32:16.519
I booked a car.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:20.720
Then… see you next time.

00:32:21.599 --> 00:32:22.559
Next time?

00:32:23.319 --> 00:32:25.440
Exactly which “next time”?

00:32:26.319 --> 00:32:26.880
Okay.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.200
Anyway, we can hang out anytime.

00:32:30.279 --> 00:32:32.200
“Anytime” is code for

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.279
“we basically won’t meet again.”

00:32:39.359 --> 00:32:39.839
Hello.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.599
I’ll arrive at your pickup point soon.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.119
Okay.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:48.079
I need to go to the place

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.000
across the street to get in.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.279
Goodbye.

00:32:57.079 --> 00:32:57.880
Li Lili,

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.039
do something, hurry up,

00:33:00.039 --> 00:33:01.839
or you’ll regret it forever.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.279
Meng Hang…

00:33:33.839 --> 00:33:35.279
After the traffic accident,

00:33:35.359 --> 00:33:36.640
she started taking care of me.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:38.960
Little by little,

00:33:39.079 --> 00:33:40.440
we went from being friends

00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:42.359
to becoming husband and wife.

00:33:43.359 --> 00:33:45.640
I think the two of us were meant to be.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.759
That car just had to

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:49.079
come at that exact moment

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.000
and slam into her.

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:53.400
Even now, Meng Hang

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.599
still doesn’t know what really happened.

00:33:56.839 --> 00:33:57.599
So then…

00:33:57.759 --> 00:33:58.359
goodbye.

00:33:59.119 --> 00:33:59.920
Goodbye.

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:04.960
Meng Hang…

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.559
What is this?

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:26.840
This is not the ending I wanted.

00:34:39.119 --> 00:34:39.840
My superpower

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.480
Is weakened by galactic spacetime warps

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.320
That twist the universe

00:34:42.559 --> 00:34:44.159
Time can only rewind ten seconds

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:45.360
I don't have time to pull him back

00:34:45.719 --> 00:34:46.559
It's okay

00:34:46.559 --> 00:34:47.559
I'll wait till he reaches the road

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.599
Then I'll call out to him

00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:50.079
No

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.280
I can't lose this chance from fear

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.000
Li Li

00:35:24.239 --> 00:35:25.920
This time I can only rewind five seconds

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.079
It's too late

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.079
Anyway, it's all wrong turns in, out

00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:48.119
What he thought was pure fate

00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:50.280
Was all your careful planning

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.480
Look at the love you see in movies

00:35:54.599 --> 00:35:56.280
It's always “meant to be” by fate

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.960
But love in real life

00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:58.639
I feel

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.840
It's like instant noodles, all flavors

00:36:01.239 --> 00:36:02.199
Each one has its own style

00:36:04.119 --> 00:36:05.519
And I also think

00:36:05.519 --> 00:36:07.400
Fighting hard for love

00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.280
Is nothing to be ashamed of

00:36:09.719 --> 00:36:10.880
What matters is doing it with heart

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.599
Instant noodle tips from Meng Hang

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:15.800
One

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.320
Boil purified water

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.320
Add noodles after the water boils

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.440
Two

00:36:20.679 --> 00:36:22.079
About 150 seconds

00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:23.920
Fish out noodles, put in a bowl

00:36:24.199 --> 00:36:26.599
For chewiness, rinse 10 sec in cold

00:36:26.599 --> 00:36:28.000
Then drain off the water

00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:29.000
Three

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.079
Low heat

00:36:30.639 --> 00:36:32.079
Crack an egg into the pot

00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:33.119
Do not stir it

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:34.719
Wait for the egg to set

00:36:35.719 --> 00:36:36.320
Four

00:36:36.679 --> 00:36:38.000
Add the seasoning packs to the pot

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:38.920
After 30 seconds

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.800
Pour the soup into the bowl

00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:41.719
Five

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.960
Noodles taste better cooked with love

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.239
This dish

00:36:47.239 --> 00:36:48.840
Is going to be called

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.360
“Every Noodle, Every Detail”

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.079
“Forever and Ever”

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.480
This is the surprise I made for Meng Hang

00:36:57.679 --> 00:37:00.639
An animated video of our love story

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.239
But maybe I should skip it

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.480
Instead of glossing and romanticizing us

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.920
It's better if we both

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.960
Just keep for ourselves

00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.719
Our private memories

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.000
Is your sister still in there?

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:32.599
Yes.

00:37:33.079 --> 00:37:34.119
Brother-in-law, I finally know

00:37:34.119 --> 00:37:36.119
what I can do for your wedding.

00:37:36.719 --> 00:37:37.360
You go first.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.199
After you're done,

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:39.920
I'll say no.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:41.920
What about the trust between people?

00:37:42.079 --> 00:37:42.719
Go on.

00:37:42.719 --> 00:37:43.320
Listen to me.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.280
I plan to film the whole process

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.079
of your wedding preparations.

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.480
That's a good idea.

00:37:47.719 --> 00:37:48.480
So you agree?

00:37:48.719 --> 00:37:49.880
I reluctantly agree.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.239
It's a deal.

00:37:52.199 --> 00:37:53.960
On the condition that I'm your MC.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.679
I didn't agree to that.

00:37:55.679 --> 00:37:56.880
I already bought the suit.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.679
Actually, before I met Meng Hang,

00:38:02.119 --> 00:38:03.880
I was pretty disheartened with Earth.

00:38:04.719 --> 00:38:05.599
So...

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:06.440
when my editor-in-chief told me

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.559
to give Earth another chance,

00:38:09.199 --> 00:38:12.119
I was ready to go over his head

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.079
and suggest that Earth be demolished.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.320
But...

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.480
I never expected

00:38:19.119 --> 00:38:20.039
that because of one person,

00:38:20.239 --> 00:38:21.119
I would come to love a whole planet.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:23.960
In a sense,

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.639
Meng Hang

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.000
saved the Earth.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:30.880
I once

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:32.440
heard a saying

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.559
that

00:38:33.559 --> 00:38:34.920
people who fall in love

00:38:35.239 --> 00:38:36.400
all become poets.

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:38.960
This next poem

00:38:39.119 --> 00:38:40.880
is what I want to read at the wedding.

00:38:41.079 --> 00:38:42.400
A poem I wrote myself.

00:38:47.079 --> 00:38:48.400
Our encounter

00:38:49.079 --> 00:38:51.880
was a reunion after the Big Bang.

00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.559
A love that crossed light-years

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.559
was an eternity destined in an instant.

00:38:59.480 --> 00:39:00.559
Your gravity

00:39:01.119 --> 00:39:02.760
is the speed at which I fly to you.

00:39:03.639 --> 00:39:04.840
My orbit,

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.679
from now on, has

00:39:07.199 --> 00:39:08.199
the curvature of love.
