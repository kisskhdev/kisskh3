You fooled me?

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:47.519
In fact, I first approached
you with a purpose.

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:50.759
What's that?

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:03.590
All right,

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.746
didn't you have a girlfriend
you dated for three years?

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.156
Despising the poor, she dumped you.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.920
So you turned to me.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.956
You know I had a girlfriend
I dated for three years?

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.880
Yes.

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.710
Then

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.310
do you know who she is?

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.920
I neither know nor care to.

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:37.156
Why?

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.660
Because I can't stand that in your past story I
wasn't involved, you have an unforgettable love.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.380
Wei, did you ever admit it to him?

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:06.000
I wanted to, but swallowed
it back after what he said.

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.256
Forget it.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.635
Let it be, we are not from
the same world anyway.

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:18.396
Our friends differ vastly.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.996
Except for Guo Cheng Yu, no
one would tell our story to him.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.755
Yes, if it can be kept secret,
it's better not to tell him.

00:03:26.779 --> 00:03:28.716
Once your relationship stabilizes,

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.640
you might bring it up.

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.239
That's true.

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.499
Wei, pay my phone bill.

You are really stingy.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.636
It's not about being stingy,
okay? Chi Cheng did it on purpose.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.155
No one calls just as they leave, and stay on
the line even when there's nothing to say.

00:04:16.179 --> 00:04:19.275
Isn't this good? Keeping
close means loving you.

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.715
For love to last, there
should be giving and taking.

00:04:22.739 --> 00:04:24.955
You should be close to him.

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.715
But I need my own space.

00:04:26.739 --> 00:04:31.336
Do two men need to be so sentimental
when they're in a relationship?

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.140
Is it necessary to be so?

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.480
Of course.

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.590
Can you buy me a bigger one?

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:56.460
This is the largest size.

It's okay.

I just need to tug a bit.

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.955
Wang Shuo gave you a snake,
and you kept it for seven years.

I give you a pair of pants, can
you wear them for seven years?

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:37.720
If you only give me this pair,
I can wear them for a lifetime.

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.580
You mean they aren't good enough
and you want me to buy another pair?

How much money do you still have?

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:54.939
Don't get ideas about it.

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:00.559
Wei, you're so stingy
in just the right way.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.280
What does that mean?

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.820
Not only do you avoid spending
money, but you take money from others.

You really think I can't, rather
than don't want to, do you?

00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:25.640
Your mind is full of Chi Cheng,
of course you don't want to.

00:15:26.679 --> 00:15:29.400
You think I like Chi Cheng?

00:15:30.759 --> 00:15:34.576
Aren't you? But I advise
you to quit while you can.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.816
Chi Cheng really likes Wei now.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.096
You two are the same
type. It's not suitable.

you. It's not your fault.

The one earlier, made relatively small

00:32:57.088 --> 00:32:59.856

00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.136
Now there is enough material,
and the new home is quite large.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.440
I want to give it a new one.

00:33:06.559 --> 00:33:08.456
Look, this piece of wood.

00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.055

of a tropical rainforest?

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.319
According to its species,
it will surely like it.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:28.176
Are you an idiot? Does it hurt?

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.399
No. Just applying a band-aid will be fine.

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:50.159
I was wondering why you've
been so sneaky these days. Sorry.

00:33:53.519 --> 00:33:55.319
Sorry.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.616
Chi Cheng, I haven't gotten used
to gay love yet, but I'm quick-witted.

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.839
I believe I'll become
a top-notch boyfriend.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:17.920
You already are.

00:34:30.016 --> 00:34:32.879
Adulterer, take this.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.080
It's okay, don't mind him.

00:35:18.272 --> 00:35:23.662
♫ I really want to tell you ♫

00:35:25.728 --> 00:35:31.665
♫ There's more than just the
sunset and the distant sea ♫

00:35:33.024 --> 00:35:39.112
♫ If today won't come back again ♫

00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:46.209
♫ Don't mind the change of day and night ♫

00:35:47.808 --> 00:35:53.881
♫ I really want to tell you ♫

00:35:55.300 --> 00:36:01.265
♫ There's more than
just stars or mountains ♫

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:08.569
♫ The sun rises and
sets, you're all I see ♫

00:36:08.593 --> 00:36:16.593
♫ Not fearing the halt of time ♫

00:36:17.357 --> 00:36:22.647
♫ The last night on Earth ♫

00:36:24.800 --> 00:36:30.542
♫ I just want to confess to you ♫

00:36:32.096 --> 00:36:38.105
♫ Get through the doomsday with sincerity ♫

00:36:38.129 --> 00:36:46.129
♫ Perhaps no regret ♫

00:36:46.944 --> 00:36:52.424
♫ The last night on Earth ♫

00:36:54.208 --> 00:36:59.729
♫ When life turns to dust ♫

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:07.609
♫ When seawater kisses the sky ♫

00:37:07.633 --> 00:37:15.633
♫ I'll take you away without hesitation ♫
