WEBVTT

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.240
Why don't you let me have Brother Gao?

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.000
Let him be my husband.

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.976
How about it?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
What?

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.120
Actually, Gao Xing and
I are in a fake marriage.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.815
We have three rules.

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:25.799
We don't interfere in
each other's relationships.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.335
If Miss Cheng likes him,

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.359
and he likes you too,

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.960
I certainly don't mind.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.879
That's great, a fake marriage!

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.719
Don't worry, Brother Gao really likes me.

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:36.439
Hey.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.840
Su Yi, don't mess around.

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:39.576
Who's messing around?

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.496
Anyway, you and President
Su are just in a fake marriage.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.520
She won't get jealous.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:43.679
Right, President Su?

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:45.479
Of course.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.000
What right do I have to be jealous?

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:48.439
Then I won't bother you two.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.960
Qingyan, wait for me!

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.039
Wife.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.840
Qingyan.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.375
Brother Gao, you still have
to take me back to the hotel.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:57.576
Alright, you go back by yourself first.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.896
I have something to do, so I'll leave first.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.920
Where are you going?

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.016
My wife is angry.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.360
I need to keep her company first.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.680
I came all this way just to see you.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.760
You should at least
take me back to the hotel.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.120
Alright.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.480
The task is done.

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:20.799
Then I'll head back first.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.016
Brother Gao, since you're already here,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.519
you should at least keep me company.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.215
If I don't go back soon,

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:27.759
I might not be able to go back at all.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.519
It's all just an act anyway.

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:31.399
It's not like I'm your real sister-in-law.

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:34.319
How about this

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:36.959
I'll pay you too,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.799
and you can pretend to be my husband.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm your brother.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.976
Brothers and sisters can't
pretend to be a married couple.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.176
Wouldn't that be mixing up the roles?

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.935
I don't want to be siblings with you.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.295
Brother Gao, we've known
each other since we were young.

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:50.376
I've seen with my own eyes

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.976
how you never lost your
ambition in hard times,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.736
and how you help others
when you're successful.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.319
A man as outstanding as you

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.640
what woman wouldn't want to be your wife?

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.239
Even if you flatter me endlessly,

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.120
I still only see you as a sister.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.640
I'm leaving.

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:10.759
Ouch.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:13.199
What's wrong?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.280
I twisted my ankle.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.400
Did you really twist it, or are you faking?

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:31.439
Let me take a look.

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:43.759
Does it still hurt?

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.879
It hurts—a lot.

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:56.599
Qing Yan.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.216
Gao Xing took Cheng Suyi back to the hotel.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.479
He still hasn't come back yet.

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.855
What does it matter to me
whether he comes back or not?

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.559
Aren't you going to do something about it?

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.720
What right do I have to interfere?

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.816
He and I are contractually married.

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.855
He can go wherever he wants.

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:11.999
He can do whatever he wants.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.360
It's none of my business.

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:14.840
Are you sure about that?

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.000
I just saw the way Cheng Suyi was acting.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.199
She looked like she was
going to eat Gao Xing alive.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:24.240
The two of them alone in a hotel,
man and woman, sparks could fly.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.640
If something really happens between them,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.360
it'll be too late for you to regret it.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.520
Then what should I do?

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.280
My relationship with him is fake.

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.039
What right do I have to control him?

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.056
Even if it's a fake marriage,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.256
we still have a marriage certificate.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.000
Besides, the contract hasn't expired yet.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.719
If he fools around outside,

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:42.855
and your family or Song Haoyang finds out,

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.520
won't your relationship be exposed?

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:46.719
That's true.

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:49.000
So according to the contract,

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:50.575
not only do I have the right to interfere,

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:51.800
I actually have to interfere.

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.856
That makes sense, right?

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.400
It makes perfect sense.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.280
Let's go.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.360
Let's go.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.695
Hang in there.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:00.719
It's this room.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.615
Don't rush.

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.615
Shh, wait.

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:07.639
Listen a bit more.

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:10.199
Brother Gao,

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.800
You're still so skilled after all this time.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.560
I'm going to press harder now.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.920
Stop!

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:19.439
Qingyan, don't be impulsive.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.920
What are you doing?

00:04:26.399 --> 00:04:27.399
She twisted her ankle.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.040
I'm giving her a massage.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.495
President Su, don't you
have something to do?

00:04:31.519 --> 00:04:32.519
Why are you here?

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.360
I twisted my ankle too.

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:40.639
I came to have him massage it.

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:44.200
President Su, your timing with
this twisted ankle is quite something.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.439
Miss Cheng's ankle,

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.279
was twisted at just the right moment too.

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.480
Alright, I'll massage yours too.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.480
Brother Gao, my ankle isn't better yet.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:56.815
Aren't you going to keep massaging mine?

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:58.720
Alright, I'll do both at the same time.

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:03.160
Ouch!

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.399
That feels so good.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:08.120
Brother Gao, your left hand
massages way better than your right.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.920
Really?

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:13.120
As far as I know, Gao
Xing isn't left-handed.

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:15.399
Anyone with common sense knows

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:18.079
the right hand massages
better than the left.

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:20.879
Brother Gao, I want your right hand too.

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:23.319
Alright, I'll switch hands.

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:29.480
Aren't you two in a fake marriage?

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.839
I heard you even set three ground rules.

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.240
Brother Gao has to pay a
fine just for touching you.

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:35.959
So why are you letting him massage you?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
It's fine.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600
I have money.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.280
I'll pay the fine for him.

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:56.240
Looks like I'm not needed here.

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:58.439
Sorry to bother you.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.199
You're jealous.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:16.920
Who's jealous?

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.696
We're just a fake couple anyway.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.096
I can't control who you're with.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.120
Really?

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:22.599
Then I can go back to her, right?

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.816
You...

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.560
Don't be mad.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.439
I've actually known Suyi for a long time.

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:31.656
I only see her as a little sister.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.616
There's nothing else between us.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.255
She's now the head of
the ancient medical family.

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:35.879
She's really busy with a lot of affairs.

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:37.176
Besides,

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.175
she came here this time just to help me.

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:40.399
She'll be leaving tomorrow.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.976
She twisted her ankle right in front of me.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.977
Whether it was real or not,

00:06:43.001 --> 00:06:44.321
how could I not take care of her?

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:47.879
Why are you explaining all this to me?

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.439
We're not a real couple anyway.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.279
Hey...

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.680
Who says we're not a real couple?

00:06:51.839 --> 00:06:52.976
We have a marriage certificate.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.639
A husband has to report
things like this to his wife.

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:02.759
Whatever you want.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.240
I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

00:07:13.079 --> 00:07:15.720
Brother Gao, are you
really not coming with me?

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:17.319
I still have things to do.

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:18.399
You go back first.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.000
Is it because of that fake wife?

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.160
I really don't get how
she's better than me.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.199
What are you thinking
about all day, you little rascal?

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.375
I'm not a kid anymore.

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:29.375
I'm already twenty.

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:30.199
I can get married now.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.375
No matter how old you are,

00:07:31.399 --> 00:07:33.800
you're still a little kid in my eyes.

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:36.079
I'm not talking to you anymore.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.439
Don't worry, I'll come back again.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.759
Next time, I'll have a
proper match with you.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
No problem, I'm always ready.

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.279
Cheng Suyi has left.

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:49.976
Ah.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
She left.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:52.839
Then let's get down to business.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.120
Zhao Daqiang hit it
off with him right away.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.800
Liu Xin and Liu Shanhe were
lucky to run into the inspector.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.495
And there's also Zhou Pengfei,
the boss of Tiange Group.

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:05.039
They all treat him with great respect.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.720
Even the head of the ancient medical family

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.415
has become like a sibling to him.

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:11.136
Once could be a coincidence.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.560
Twice could be luck.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.399
But three or four times
in a row is not normal.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.920
There must be something going on here.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.096
This Gao Xing

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.879
must have secrets we don't know about.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.800
But we've checked the
records over and over again

00:08:27.079 --> 00:08:28.479
and haven't found anything unusual.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.976
Records can be faked.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.199
But background can't be.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.976
Doesn't the record say
he's from Qingshui Village?

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.279
Then let's go to Qingshui
Village and see for ourselves.

00:08:36.519 --> 00:08:37.519
Okay.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.399
You two

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:44.639
want to go to my home?

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.200
That's right.

00:08:46.399 --> 00:08:47.919
Aren't we already married?

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:50.120
A wife visiting her in-laws

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.600
isn't a problem, is it?

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:54.655
Normally, there's no problem.

00:08:54.679 --> 00:08:55.679
But, honey...

00:08:59.080 --> 00:08:59.720
President Su.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.080
Did you forget

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.400
that we are a contract couple?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.480
I signed the contract.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.216
I'm just here to play along with you.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.840
There's no need for you
to meet my parents, right?

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.840
Of course there is.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.816
If we're acting, we
have to do the whole act.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.840
Since we're married, we're a couple.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.416
Visiting your parents

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.200
will help me understand you better.

00:09:17.399 --> 00:09:19.600
That way, our act will be more convincing.

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:20.655
Isn't that right?

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:21.679
You're right.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.136
What is it?

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.600
Our Qingyan is going home with you,

00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:26.015
are you worried she's not presentable?

00:09:26.039 --> 00:09:27.120
That she'll embarrass you?

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:28.879
How could that be?

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.976
My wife is a dignified and beautiful CEO,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.015
talented and beautiful.

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:32.776
Her coming to my home

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.279
is an honor for my family.

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:35.440
That's good, then.

00:09:36.039 --> 00:09:38.639
The information says
you're from Qingshui Village.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.000
Let's head out now.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.120
Is that okay?

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.775
Or is it

00:09:46.799 --> 00:09:48.799
that you have some secret you can't tell?

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:50.200
Is it inconvenient?

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.080
No, of course it's convenient.

00:09:53.639 --> 00:09:54.639
You're more than welcome.
