Episode 6
Heartfelt Words

00:01:59.494 --> 00:02:02.247
Did you know Attorney Ha
was from a wealthy family?

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:05.625
I had no idea.
I just found out from the article.

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:07.586
Seriously, I was shocked.

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:10.047
How can you be that two-faced?
It's so scary.

00:02:10.922 --> 00:02:13.216
- Is he hiding how he's rich?
- That's enough.

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:15.594
Let's get to work.

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:16.970
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:33.904
HA, THE ELDEST SON OF HANGUK GROUP'S CEO,
DREW ATTENTION FOR…

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.531
STARTING HIS LEGAL CAREER
AT A SEOCHO-DONG LAW FIRM…

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.726
- Could I get a piece of rolled omelette?
- Sure.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:57.237
Are those reporters?

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:04.953
Maybe it's from Hanguk Group's secretary.

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.247
Read the room.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.457
What?

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.631
What?

00:04:24.222 --> 00:04:26.391
HELLO ATTORNEY HA
PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.146
Together?

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:37.402
- I've never teamed up on a case before.
- Okay, then.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:41.490
They only have one associate.
Attorney Kang will likely handle it.

00:04:41.573 --> 00:04:44.367
We have two,
so I'll ask Attorney Bae.

00:04:45.952 --> 00:04:47.370
I'll just take it.

00:04:49.414 --> 00:04:51.666
Our advisor, Ms. Kim,
gave us the case on the condition

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.294
we work with a firm from another floor.

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:55.420
I see.

00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:58.799
Here he comes.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.637
So you're taking the case, Attorney Ahn?

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.014
Am I working on it with him?

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.390
Yes.

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:15.273
You two know each other, right?

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:16.525
Yes.

00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:23.031
Now that I see you two like this,
you look pretty good together.

00:05:23.907 --> 00:05:25.075
Sorry?

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:28.286
All right.
Please take good care of Attorney Kang.

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.335
Don't get distracted.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:47.013
So which side are we representing?

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:50.475
The plaintiff, Kang Changjun.

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:52.269
WRONGFUL TERMINATION SUIT

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:05.532
Hey! Say something!

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:08.660
You never listen to a damn thing!

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:12.205
How many times have I told you?
What? It hurts?

00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:15.375
Now this punk's not even answering me.

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:20.046
Hey. I said answer me.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.965
Answer me, you punk!

00:06:22.048 --> 00:06:23.675
You little bastard!

00:06:24.426 --> 00:06:26.011
You son of a…

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:27.846
Get up, you punk.

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:31.516
Get up.

00:06:40.692 --> 00:06:42.777
We got a report about a fight.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.279
Thank you for coming.

00:06:44.362 --> 00:06:45.363
Hello, officers.

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:47.908
I heard it wasn't much of an issue though.

00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:49.659
We're fine. You can go.

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:52.162
Since we received a call,
we still need to check.

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:54.914
There's no problem.
We can't have you come in like this.

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:58.251
- Were they the two fighting?
- Not at all. It's not a big deal.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:08.219
Have you seen him hit anyone before?

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:09.596
No, it was my first time.

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.307
If it happened before,
I wouldn't have been shocked.

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.018
But he was beating the kid like a dog.

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.228
It didn't seem right,
so I called the cops.

00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:21.274
But the kid goes and says
he was never hit.

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:24.194
And they told you
to stop coming in the next day?

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.278
Yes.

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:28.490
Once they heard I called the cops,
they fired me right away.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.659
What was the reason they gave?

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.703
It probably wasn't
because you called the cops, right?

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.830
There was no reason.
They just said I was fired.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.001
I did nothing wrong.
Why should I get fired?

00:07:40.794 --> 00:07:43.797
This counts
as wrongful termination, right?

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:48.093
Aside from everything else,

00:07:48.176 --> 00:07:51.137
no proper steps were taken
in the termination process.

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:53.682
If we focus on that,
it should be an easy case.

00:07:54.265 --> 00:07:57.602
Under labor laws, they did skip
every step of the termination process.

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:58.853
Isn't that all we need then?

00:07:58.937 --> 00:08:02.357
But before that, we have to see
if Kang Changjun counts as an employee.

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:06.236
He's a club DJ,
but do labor laws cover him?

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.613
His employment status.

00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.532
You're right.

00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:15.120
That needs to be recognized first.
But from what we've heard, it's iffy.

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.747
There's no contract, no insurance,

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:21.459
and no suitable way
to prove working hours.

00:08:21.543 --> 00:08:22.752
And he didn't work every day.

00:08:23.712 --> 00:08:25.755
What about pay? He must've been paid.

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:28.883
Yes, he probably was.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:33.346
But since he didn't have
a regular five-day work week,

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.724
that amount likely changed every month.

00:08:36.558 --> 00:08:38.643
So it wouldn't look like a fixed salary.

00:08:38.727 --> 00:08:41.479
- It'll look like he just got paid per gig.
- Right.

00:08:41.563 --> 00:08:43.398
Even if he's recognized as an employee,

00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:47.777
Kang Changjun has been accused of filing
a false report against Lee Dongsu.

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:50.655
In the end, it might not count
as wrongful termination.

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:55.035
Even if this termination is deemed invalid
due to procedural issues,

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.872
they could just fire him again
by taking proper procedures.

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.665
Exactly. That's the point.

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.922
Then, should we go meet that guy first?

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:11.009
- Who?
- Jeong Minkyu, the person who was hit.

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:12.927
Where?

00:09:20.143 --> 00:09:21.186
You came like this?

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.729
Look who's talking.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.481
I'm here for work. What else would I wear?

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.232
You're not supposed to show that.

00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:30.361
At least, take your tie off.

00:09:30.445 --> 00:09:31.821
Geez, why would I take it off?

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:33.531
Just listen to me.

00:09:42.499 --> 00:09:44.834
Let's undo just two buttons.

00:09:44.918 --> 00:09:47.378
Okay, fine. I'll do it myself.

00:09:49.798 --> 00:09:52.425
- Take off the jacket.
- The jacket too? It's cold.

00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:53.510
- Take it off.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:00.058
That's much better.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.227
Did we have to come here though?

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.979
Even Mr. Kang didn't have
his contact information.

00:10:05.063 --> 00:10:07.023
I'm sure we would've found that out later.

00:10:07.107 --> 00:10:09.400
We can't wait around for that. Let's go.

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:05.165
You said you were here for work.

00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:38.072
Is Jeong Minkyu here by any chance?

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:40.366
- Who?
- Jeong Minkyu.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:44.037
Try over there.

00:12:18.238 --> 00:12:19.280
Excuse me.

00:12:20.323 --> 00:12:21.741
Are you looking for the restroom?

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:23.826
Only employees can be here,
so you can't come in.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.286
You're Jeong Minkyu, right?

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:30.500
- Who are you?
- You know Kang Changjun, right?

00:12:32.043 --> 00:12:34.504
- Yes.
- We are his lawyers.

00:12:34.587 --> 00:12:38.967
When you were assaulted,
Mr. Kang reported it and got fired for it.

00:12:39.676 --> 00:12:41.094
- He got fired?
- Yes.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:45.265
We wanted to hear your side
of what happened that day.

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.019
He was mistaken and filed the report.

00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:52.897
I'm sorry, but I'm kind of busy.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.484
We might be able
to help you too, Mr. Jeong.

00:13:02.407 --> 00:13:05.410
I got hit because I deserved it.
It wasn't a big deal.

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:08.997
It's not serious enough to need your help.

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:11.499
Next time you come by,

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:14.127
book a table through me.

00:13:14.711 --> 00:13:15.712
That's what will help me.

00:13:17.839 --> 00:13:19.382
I don't know what happened,

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:22.010
but no one deserves to get hit.

00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:26.931
No matter what you did,

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:30.059
Lee Dongsu had no right
to lay hands on you.

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.897
So if you change your mind,
please give me a call.

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:46.534
Who are you?

00:13:52.582 --> 00:13:55.585
This area's for staff only.
You can't come in here.

00:13:58.755 --> 00:14:01.007
I wonder where you could be from.

00:14:02.383 --> 00:14:04.052
Aren't you looking for a DJ here?

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.429
I heard there's an opening.

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:09.807
- A DJ?
- I wasn't sure who I should talk to.

00:14:12.977 --> 00:14:14.020
Both of you?

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:17.190
You don't take DJ teams?

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:25.031
"Aren't you looking for a DJ?"

00:14:26.407 --> 00:14:27.700
"You don't take DJ teams?"

00:14:27.784 --> 00:14:30.703
You mentioned the DJ thing first,
so I had to go along with it.

00:14:30.787 --> 00:14:32.330
You could've said "manager" instead.

00:14:32.413 --> 00:14:34.290
- Call you the manager?
- No, yourself.

00:14:36.417 --> 00:14:40.463
Anyone would see that you'd be my manager
and I'd be the DJ.

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.673
You don't exactly look like a DJ either.

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:48.805
So do you think he'll call us?

00:14:50.264 --> 00:14:53.226
Getting his statement won't be easy,
but let's wait and see.

00:15:11.077 --> 00:15:12.286
I forgot to take this off.

00:15:21.754 --> 00:15:23.673
- Give me your wrist.
- No, it's okay.

00:15:23.756 --> 00:15:24.841
No…

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.687
You must've been to a lot of clubs.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.481
- Yes. You haven't?
- I haven't.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:43.317
And you call yourself a DJ.

00:15:53.035 --> 00:15:58.749
24 HOURS
HANGOVER FIX

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:32.283
This is my stop.

00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:34.493
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:45.898
Hello, Attorney Kang!

00:17:45.982 --> 00:17:47.942
- Hello, sir.
- Did you just get in to work?

00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:49.443
Yes. Are you going somewhere?

00:17:49.527 --> 00:17:54.448
I just ran out of coffee this morning,
so I'm heading to the store.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:55.575
Would you like these?

00:17:55.658 --> 00:17:58.327
They're great
when coffee's a bit much for the stomach.

00:17:58.411 --> 00:17:59.912
Goodness, thank you!

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:02.999
Hello.

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:04.292
How long will it take?

00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:06.794
Just a moment.

00:18:06.877 --> 00:18:10.214
- Sir, what's all that?
- That?

00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:12.633
They're installing a base station
in our building.

00:18:12.717 --> 00:18:14.260
Really?

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:17.513
I heard the rent being paid for this
is pretty sweet too.

00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.724
So is Ms. Kim going to
give you a bonus?

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:22.518
No, nothing like that!

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:24.895
Well, go on up then.

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:26.397
All right, have a good day.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:27.648
Thank you.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.612
OPERATION BY AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

00:18:47.752 --> 00:18:50.254
Do you need anything else?

00:18:50.338 --> 00:18:52.298
This should be enough to make a case.

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.760
And if it's ruled to be
wrongful termination,

00:18:55.843 --> 00:18:59.639
you're entitled to back pay
for the time you weren't able to work

00:18:59.722 --> 00:19:01.932
- We'll add this to your claim as well.
- No.

00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:05.186
I have no reason to leave.

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:07.772
I only care about proving
I'm not at fault.

00:19:07.855 --> 00:19:11.317
I don't want to get paid
for the days I missed.

00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:17.406
This is a legal right that protects you
from wrongful termination.

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:18.824
You don't have to think that way.

00:19:18.908 --> 00:19:22.161
As long as I can work again
with my head held high, that's all I need.

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:28.376
But do you really want to go back
and work there again?

00:19:28.459 --> 00:19:29.669
Yes.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.383
I came from the countryside and worked
so hard to make it in a Hongdae club.

00:19:37.051 --> 00:19:38.260
There's no reason to stay away.

00:19:39.345 --> 00:19:40.429
I did nothing wrong.

00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:48.479
Okay, we'll stick to only having
the termination invalidated.

00:19:49.397 --> 00:19:50.398
Thank you.

00:19:53.567 --> 00:19:55.361
Hello, this is Law Group Hyungmin.

00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:58.447
Yes, where are you calling from?

00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:04.995
Yes?

00:20:06.747 --> 00:20:07.998
A fellow alumnus from my school?

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.001
Okay, put him through.

00:20:12.503 --> 00:20:13.671
Hello, I'm on the line.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:17.466
<i>- Attorney Ha?</i>
- Yes, speaking.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.261
<i>Hi, I'm Lee Minwoo from HR Hunting.</i>

00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:21.595
<i>I'm a recruiter.</i>

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:24.765
<i>You went to Gwangseong Law School, right?</i>
<i>I'm a graduate too.</i>

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:27.226
I see.

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:29.103
I'm sorry, but how can I help you?

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.815
<i>A startup that just closed</i>
<i>its Series C funding round</i>

00:20:33.399 --> 00:20:36.318
<i>wants to bring you in as its director.</i>

00:20:36.402 --> 00:20:37.945
<i>Would you be interested?</i>

00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:40.823
<i>They're guaranteeing</i>
<i>corporate executive-level pay.</i>

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:41.949
Me?

00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:43.033
<i>Yes.</i>

00:20:43.617 --> 00:20:47.121
<i>They specifically asked for you,</i>
<i>which is why I'm reaching out.</i>

00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:52.209
But I've never actually worked
in-house before.

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:53.878
Why me though?

00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:57.673
<i>Well, they're looking to build ties</i>
<i>with Hanguk Group.</i>

00:20:57.757 --> 00:21:01.302
<i>It sounds like they're hoping</i>
<i>you can give them some leverage.</i>

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:04.722
I'm sorry. I have to go.

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:09.393
<i>Is it okay…</i>

00:21:09.477 --> 00:21:11.395
if I bring it up?

00:21:11.979 --> 00:21:13.773
About what exactly?

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.941
That article…

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:19.069
Is it true?

00:21:20.613 --> 00:21:21.697
It's not.

00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:25.075
Okay.

00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:27.244
Then, that's what our firm will go with.

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:30.039
- Let me know if you have any issues.
- I don't.

00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:32.166
Okay.

00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:47.223
It's freezing.

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:48.891
- He's here.
- Where's Sanggi?

00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:52.686
He had something urgent to do
and told us to eat first.

00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:02.613
All right.

00:22:04.615 --> 00:22:05.908
So?

00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:09.119
No one's going to mention Sanggi?

00:22:09.203 --> 00:22:10.830
He wanted us to play dumb.

00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:13.290
Was that what he meant?

00:22:13.374 --> 00:22:14.667
Yes, it was.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.001
I told you to read the room.

00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:22.800
- Is yours <i>bulgogi?</i>
- Yeah.

00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:24.552
- Trade with me.
- Okay.

00:22:27.638 --> 00:22:30.224
But did you guys know about it?

00:22:30.307 --> 00:22:31.392
We had no idea.

00:22:32.351 --> 00:22:35.229
- Did you?
- No, I had no clue.

00:22:36.272 --> 00:22:37.898
I was the one most in the dark.

00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:39.900
Why are you so upset about that?

00:22:39.984 --> 00:22:41.235
He wanted us in the dark.

00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:43.612
Yeah, let's give Sanggi some time.

00:22:53.539 --> 00:22:54.540
What's with you now?

00:22:56.876 --> 00:22:57.877
Damn it.

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.469
- Are you leaving just now?
- Yeah.

00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:55.893
You should have told me.

00:23:57.478 --> 00:23:59.647
- About what?
- That my family made money

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:01.106
working under yours.

00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:05.903
It must've been so laughable
every time I mentioned it.

00:24:08.322 --> 00:24:09.323
It's not like that.

00:24:09.406 --> 00:24:10.491
Maybe not for you.

00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:13.535
But if I suddenly find out like this,

00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:16.121
how could I not think that?

00:24:16.705 --> 00:24:17.831
It's not what you think.

00:24:18.666 --> 00:24:19.667
What is it then?

00:24:23.253 --> 00:24:24.546
What's your deal?

00:24:26.757 --> 00:24:28.717
You still have nothing to say to me?

00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:32.721
It's not just about my family.

00:24:32.805 --> 00:24:35.724
I thought we were a lot closer
than some random coworker.

00:24:36.892 --> 00:24:39.561
I thought we could be honest
about everything.

00:24:39.645 --> 00:24:42.898
I never talk about my family
to just anyone. I did it since it was you.

00:24:56.078 --> 00:24:58.247
I guess only I thought we were friends.

00:24:59.915 --> 00:25:01.000
I'm sorry.

00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:31.447
The defendant has denied
the plaintiff's employment status claim,

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:36.285
and the plaintiff has submitted
materials to prove it.

00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:37.369
Yes, Your Honor.

00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:39.705
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Plaintiff's counsel.

00:25:40.289 --> 00:25:44.460
Could you briefly explain the evidence?

00:25:47.129 --> 00:25:48.130
Yes, Your Honor.

00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:53.093
First, please refer to Exhibit 3,
the plaintiff's subway transit records.

00:25:55.763 --> 00:25:57.931
He consistently clocked in and out
at the same times

00:25:58.015 --> 00:26:01.268
at the club run by the defendant.

00:26:01.351 --> 00:26:04.772
If you refer to the plaintiff's
cell phone records in Exhibit 4…

00:26:13.405 --> 00:26:17.534
These show he was always
in Seogyo-dong, Mapo-gu during work hours,

00:26:17.618 --> 00:26:20.120
which is where
the defendant's club is located.

00:26:25.042 --> 00:26:27.002
<i>Regardless of his performance schedule,</i>

00:26:27.086 --> 00:26:28.962
he had clearly set working hours.

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.687
The pay received by the plaintiff
may appear to vary each month,

00:26:45.771 --> 00:26:47.898
but you can see
it matches his days worked,

00:26:47.981 --> 00:26:51.026
and it has nothing to do
with the number of performances.

00:26:51.652 --> 00:26:55.864
He was paid for showing up for work,
not for performing.

00:26:56.406 --> 00:26:59.368
Most importantly, the messages
between the plaintiff and defendant

00:26:59.451 --> 00:27:01.078
prove that he was working

00:27:01.161 --> 00:27:03.622
under the defendant's
supervision and control.

00:27:03.705 --> 00:27:05.207
<i>Work the 11:00 p.m. and the 3:00 a.m.</i>

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:06.834
<i>That's why I said to get in there.</i>

00:27:06.917 --> 00:27:08.502
<i>You have nothing for today.</i>
<i>Just go home.</i>

00:27:09.086 --> 00:27:11.088
- Defense counsel.
- Yes, Your Honor?

00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:13.590
Are those texts really from the defendant?

00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:18.679
- Defense counsel?
- Is it true that you sent them?

00:27:20.222 --> 00:27:23.517
Counsel, who are you talking to?

00:27:24.935 --> 00:27:26.270
The defendant, Lee Dongsu.

00:27:29.064 --> 00:27:30.899
Are you the defendant?

00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:34.528
- Yes.
- Step forward, please.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.412
- Defense counsel.
- Yes, Your Honor?

00:27:43.495 --> 00:27:45.998
Did you know he was back there?

00:27:47.666 --> 00:27:48.667
Well…

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.421
If you were present,
you should've sat up front.

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.256
Why were you back there?

00:27:54.339 --> 00:27:56.758
Should I take that as a sign
you're hiding something?

00:27:56.842 --> 00:27:58.176
No, it's not like that.

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:00.137
The termination process
wasn't followed, was it?

00:28:08.604 --> 00:28:11.148
He wasn't an employee,
so it wasn't a termination.

00:28:11.231 --> 00:28:12.774
Did you follow the procedure?

00:28:12.858 --> 00:28:15.611
A club DJ isn't an employee.

00:28:15.694 --> 00:28:17.863
It seems you sat back there
without listening.

00:28:17.946 --> 00:28:20.032
That is exactly what we've proven.

00:28:20.908 --> 00:28:23.201
Kang Changjun is an employee.

00:28:24.328 --> 00:28:25.412
Plaintiff's counsel.

00:28:26.496 --> 00:28:29.249
Please refrain from addressing
the other party directly.

00:28:30.334 --> 00:28:32.210
Yes, Your Honor. I apologize.

00:28:46.058 --> 00:28:48.393
- Nice work today.
- Hello, Ms. Kim.

00:28:48.477 --> 00:28:49.811
I was curious and stopped by.

00:28:49.895 --> 00:28:51.521
- You came well-prepared.
- Yes.

00:28:59.529 --> 00:29:00.614
You.

00:29:00.697 --> 00:29:03.533
I have proof you filed
a false police report anyway.

00:29:03.617 --> 00:29:05.118
I can just fire you again for that.

00:29:06.078 --> 00:29:07.579
Jeong Minkyu already testified.

00:29:08.372 --> 00:29:11.166
There really was an assault,
and the report wasn't false.

00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:16.380
I'm here because I kept thinking
about what you said.

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:18.632
But it just doesn't feel right.

00:29:18.715 --> 00:29:21.885
If I testify, do you really think
I can keep working there?

00:29:23.387 --> 00:29:25.472
Mr. Kang reported it

00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:28.350
to help you, Mr. Jeong.

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:30.018
I never asked for his help.

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:32.521
Other go out of their way to help you.

00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:35.691
But why won't you do the same
and take care of yourself?

00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:38.777
There's no such thing
as deserving to be hit.

00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:43.532
You don't have to testify for us.

00:29:45.158 --> 00:29:47.744
But at the very least, protect yourself.

00:29:47.828 --> 00:29:49.162
I'll help you.

00:29:52.082 --> 00:29:53.125
THE DJ CALLED THE POLICE

00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:55.127
LEE DONGSU SLAPPED AND STOMPED ON ME

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:56.378
STATEMENT BY JEONG MINKYU

00:29:56.461 --> 00:29:58.714
That little bastard, Minkyu.

00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:01.216
Jeong Minkyu
will be pressing charges soon.

00:30:12.477 --> 00:30:13.729
Just leave me alone!

00:30:13.812 --> 00:30:16.231
Why do you keep chasing me around
and annoying me?

00:30:24.406 --> 00:30:26.908
How does Lee Dongsu know our advisor?

00:30:26.992 --> 00:30:28.368
Who's your advisor?

00:30:31.371 --> 00:30:33.290
You don't know her?

00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:35.208
I don't.

00:30:40.505 --> 00:30:41.506
Really?

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:45.093
Is she seriously that rich?

00:30:45.177 --> 00:30:46.261
She owns the building.

00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:48.096
- This building?
- Yeah.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.264
Unbelievable.

00:30:50.223 --> 00:30:51.224
Did you know that?

00:30:51.308 --> 00:30:53.685
Well, I kind of figured it out.

00:30:53.769 --> 00:30:55.270
It's Kim Hyungmin's Hyungmin Building.

00:30:56.063 --> 00:30:57.064
You're right.

00:30:58.023 --> 00:30:59.107
Did you guys know?

00:30:59.691 --> 00:31:01.735
- No, I didn't.
- What about you?

00:31:02.527 --> 00:31:03.528
I didn't know either.

00:31:05.322 --> 00:31:06.323
I'm a little…

00:31:06.823 --> 00:31:08.075
out of the loop these days.

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:12.079
What's with that reaction?

00:31:12.162 --> 00:31:14.498
Since when do you stay calm
about such huge news?

00:31:14.581 --> 00:31:17.459
I can't make such a fuss all the time.

00:31:18.126 --> 00:31:19.169
What?

00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:21.254
What's up with him?

00:31:35.936 --> 00:31:38.021
A BETTER TOMORROW, CORRECTION FOR HOPE

00:31:44.194 --> 00:31:46.363
<i>You'll be back in a few days anyway,</i>

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:48.907
so drop the pride.

00:31:49.533 --> 00:31:50.867
You'll only hurt yourself.

00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:54.955
Hello.

00:31:57.499 --> 00:31:58.834
You can just go in.

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:39.958
Hello.

00:32:44.629 --> 00:32:46.423
Hello, Mr. Seong.

00:33:02.272 --> 00:33:06.193
When you wanted to switch firms
for the salary, I actually respected that.

00:33:06.776 --> 00:33:09.779
You were honest.
They offered more, so going made sense.

00:33:09.863 --> 00:33:11.990
Who cares
if it's right upstairs or next door?

00:33:12.699 --> 00:33:14.951
Now, I see that was all a lie.

00:33:15.035 --> 00:33:18.747
Just say you didn't like our firm.
Why blame it on the salary?

00:33:19.331 --> 00:33:20.916
It's not like that, sir.

00:33:21.666 --> 00:33:24.419
If it's because of that article,
it's a big misunderstanding.

00:33:26.463 --> 00:33:27.547
Okay.

00:33:37.098 --> 00:33:39.100
- It'll be a little cold.
- Okay.

00:34:01.998 --> 00:34:04.251
INCHEON JUNGBU POLICE STATION
SUSPECT, KIM YUJIN

00:34:04.334 --> 00:34:06.628
THIS PERSON HAS BEEN PLACED
UNDER EMERGENCY ARREST

00:34:06.711 --> 00:34:09.422
FOR A DRUG-RELATED OFFENSE
UNDER THE NARCOTICS CONTROL ACT

00:34:12.425 --> 00:34:13.426
She's my daughter.

00:34:14.594 --> 00:34:15.720
I see.

00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:20.058
I don't know where to start.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.521
You can take your time.

00:34:24.604 --> 00:34:27.107
Or would it be easier
if I asked you first?

00:34:28.316 --> 00:34:29.359
No.

00:34:30.277 --> 00:34:31.528
I'll tell you.

00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:34.948
When she was younger,

00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:38.368
we sent her to study in the US.

00:34:38.451 --> 00:34:39.995
She was in eighth grade.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:44.666
I think that's where I should start,

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:47.544
because that was the wrong decision.

00:34:49.421 --> 00:34:52.007
Did your daughter go alone?

00:34:52.090 --> 00:34:53.633
Yes, we sent her by herself.

00:34:54.467 --> 00:34:57.512
Her father and I
had too much going on here.

00:34:58.054 --> 00:34:59.598
We believed sending her alone

00:35:00.223 --> 00:35:02.475
was the best thing for her future.

00:35:03.059 --> 00:35:04.185
She's our daughter.

00:35:05.478 --> 00:35:09.190
So we believed
she'd do just fine on her own.

00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:14.738
And she started using drugs
while she was there?

00:35:15.238 --> 00:35:16.281
Yes.

00:35:17.157 --> 00:35:19.117
She said her first time was in college.

00:35:20.285 --> 00:35:21.286
To be honest,

00:35:22.704 --> 00:35:24.205
we were aware of it earlier.

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.167
We took her to therapy,

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:29.210
brought her back to Korea,

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:31.838
and even moved to the US

00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:34.424
to live with her.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.301
But nothing worked.

00:35:36.843 --> 00:35:37.844
Then,

00:35:38.345 --> 00:35:41.681
does Yujin have any prior drug charges?

00:35:41.765 --> 00:35:42.766
No.

00:35:43.642 --> 00:35:45.310
This was her first arrest.

00:35:47.354 --> 00:35:49.022
It was an emergency arrest.

00:35:49.105 --> 00:35:51.983
Do you know where it happened?

00:35:52.067 --> 00:35:53.068
Incheon Airport.

00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:55.612
She was arrested on landing.

00:35:56.613 --> 00:35:57.947
On landing?

00:35:59.699 --> 00:36:02.327
Someone must have tipped off
the authorities then.

00:36:03.036 --> 00:36:05.038
- Do you know who it was?
- Yes.

00:36:07.832 --> 00:36:08.875
It was me.

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:14.214
She may be our daughter,
but we had reached our limit.

00:36:14.798 --> 00:36:15.799
So,

00:36:16.883 --> 00:36:19.260
we told her to come home…

00:36:25.016 --> 00:36:26.518
and we turned her in.

00:36:31.773 --> 00:36:32.774
Still,

00:36:33.817 --> 00:36:35.944
we want to get her out.

00:36:36.027 --> 00:36:37.696
That's why I'm here.

00:36:38.363 --> 00:36:41.574
Attorney Bae,
please do what you can for her.

00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:04.157
- Going home?
- Yeah.

00:38:09.370 --> 00:38:10.371
Going home?

00:38:11.623 --> 00:38:12.665
Yeah.

00:38:24.511 --> 00:38:25.845
What's with this tension?

00:38:27.138 --> 00:38:28.139
This feels weird.

00:38:41.611 --> 00:38:43.446
Hello. Are you Attorney Ha Sanggi?

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:45.740
- What?
- We're from News Off.

00:38:45.824 --> 00:38:48.076
It's for a follow-up
on law school nepotism.

00:38:48.159 --> 00:38:49.744
No, you have the wrong person.

00:38:49.828 --> 00:38:51.913
From the list,
your background's the most privileged.

00:38:51.996 --> 00:38:52.997
Excuse me.

00:38:53.081 --> 00:38:54.833
- Stop. He said no!
- Did you earn it?

00:38:54.916 --> 00:38:56.334
- Okay, we got it!
- Stop!

00:38:58.002 --> 00:38:59.212
You have the wrong person.

00:38:59.295 --> 00:39:01.881
Don't be like that. We know everything.
Please give us a word.

00:39:01.965 --> 00:39:03.424
- I said it's not me.
- Attorney Ha.

00:39:03.508 --> 00:39:04.676
- Stop.
- We know about you.

00:39:04.759 --> 00:39:06.553
- Talk with me. Go on.
- Mr. Ha.

00:39:07.136 --> 00:39:08.179
I said go on ahead.

00:39:08.263 --> 00:39:09.430
It won't cost a thing!

00:39:09.514 --> 00:39:10.515
- Mr. Ha!
- Hey!

00:39:10.598 --> 00:39:11.641
Hold on…

00:39:11.724 --> 00:39:13.059
I know a lot of fun stories.

00:39:13.142 --> 00:39:14.143
Come on.

00:39:45.925 --> 00:39:47.719
WITH FISH ROE RICE AND SHRIMP TEMPURA

00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:48.803
A PERFECT MEAL

00:39:48.887 --> 00:39:50.680
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY'S LAWYER'S TABLE

A RICH KID'S SECRET HOBBY!
EATING POOR PEOPLE FOOD

NO WONDER WHY PEOPLE CALL IT
MODERN-DAY NEPOTISM

BOUGHT THE GOOD LIFE WITH A FAT WALLET

00:39:57.812 --> 00:40:00.315

THIS IS HA SANGGI

A LAWYER'S TABLE
NEW POST

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:43.691
That lunatic.

00:40:44.484 --> 00:40:45.485
Now, of all times?

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:50.990
THIS IS HA SANGGI

00:40:59.082 --> 00:41:02.835
<i>Back in college,</i>
<i>I was nicknamed "The Spirit of Spring."</i>

00:41:04.712 --> 00:41:06.464
<i>I'd vanish during the fall semester</i>

00:41:06.547 --> 00:41:08.800
<i>and reappear at springtime</i>
<i>the next year without fail.</i>

00:41:08.883 --> 00:41:10.343
<i>That's how the nickname stuck.</i>

00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:15.807
<i>I had to work every fall</i>

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.850
<i>just to afford school in the spring.</i>

00:41:19.894 --> 00:41:23.606
<i>That's why it took me</i>
<i>eight years to graduate.</i>

00:41:27.402 --> 00:41:30.571
<i>I was born poor</i>
<i>and with pretty much nothing.</i>

00:41:33.116 --> 00:41:36.160
<i>During a childhood</i>
<i>where every day was a struggle,</i>

00:41:36.828 --> 00:41:38.955
<i>studying was the only thing I could do.</i>

00:41:39.497 --> 00:41:41.499
<i>It felt like the only way out.</i>

00:41:50.299 --> 00:41:51.926
<i>After graduating college,</i>

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:55.013
<i>I didn't have the time or means</i>
<i>to even think about law school.</i>

00:41:55.722 --> 00:41:57.640
<i>But after working for six months,</i>

00:41:57.724 --> 00:41:59.767
<i>I felt compelled to go back</i>
<i>and study again.</i>

00:42:00.643 --> 00:42:03.896
<i>Maybe I really was The Spirit of Spring.</i>

00:42:05.898 --> 00:42:08.109
<i>Without support from the school</i>
<i>and scholarships,</i>

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:10.319
<i>I never could've become a lawyer.</i>

00:42:11.154 --> 00:42:14.032
<i>I've always been thankful</i>
<i>of the anonymous generosity</i>

00:42:14.115 --> 00:42:16.284
<i>and aid system</i>
<i>for the warmth they provided.</i>

00:42:17.326 --> 00:42:21.330
<i>Someday, I hope I can pass on</i>
<i>that kindness to someone else.</i>

00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:25.835
<i>Modern-day nepotism?</i>

00:42:26.711 --> 00:42:28.463
<i>I don't know much about that.</i>

00:42:29.005 --> 00:42:32.675
<i>All I know is that students</i>
<i>are just working hard</i>

00:42:33.176 --> 00:42:34.761
<i>to become good lawyers.</i>

00:42:35.887 --> 00:42:38.806
<i>The person you mistook for me</i>
<i>because of our similar names</i>

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:40.266
<i>probably did the same.</i>

00:42:42.268 --> 00:42:44.520
<i>So please,</i>
<i>don't point fingers at him either.</i>

00:42:47.023 --> 00:42:48.024
<i>Also,</i>

00:42:48.983 --> 00:42:50.443
<i>I truly hope no one else</i>

00:42:51.027 --> 00:42:52.445
<i>has to ever prove their poverty</i>

00:42:53.529 --> 00:42:56.407
<i>the way I did tonight.</i>

00:43:14.092 --> 00:43:16.636
SEOKGO BLOOD SAUSAGE SOUP

00:43:56.425 --> 00:43:58.344
Could I get a bowl of <i>gukbap, </i>please?

00:44:35.256 --> 00:44:36.632
This isn't dinner, is it?

00:44:37.216 --> 00:44:41.179
- I had dinner hours ago.
- Then, why not just rest?

00:44:41.762 --> 00:44:43.639
What are you doing here this late?

00:44:44.223 --> 00:44:49.061
I'm fine. You're the one
who should stop working this late.

00:44:50.813 --> 00:44:53.774
I have to keep working
as long as my boss still gives me shifts.

00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:56.402
Sitting around only makes me ill.

00:44:56.986 --> 00:45:00.323
Who gets ill from resting?
You get ill from overworking.

00:45:01.199 --> 00:45:03.534
- More radish kimchi<i>,</i> please!
- All right.

00:45:05.286 --> 00:45:06.621
Hold on.

00:45:06.704 --> 00:45:08.289
Have a fried egg before you go.

00:46:28.577 --> 00:46:31.163
I handled Sujeong's divorce case.

00:46:31.247 --> 00:46:32.707
- What?
- What?

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:35.293
I represented the husband
in his lawsuit against her.

00:46:35.376 --> 00:46:37.169
- It was settled in mediation.
- No way.

00:46:37.253 --> 00:46:39.338
- No way.
- We met up afterwards and talked too.

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:41.465
No way.

00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.598
Actually, I've been doing
prison visitations lately.

00:46:51.726 --> 00:46:52.893
- Prison visitations?
- You know.

00:46:52.977 --> 00:46:54.937
You go every day to keep them company

00:46:55.021 --> 00:46:56.856
share news,
and entertain them like a butler.

00:46:57.565 --> 00:46:58.566
Things you shouldn't do.

00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:00.776
- You're doing that?
- Your boss made you do that?

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:04.864
I know. They don't even check my ID
at the front desk anymore.

00:47:04.947 --> 00:47:06.282
I'm there that often.

00:47:11.537 --> 00:47:12.830
Actually, I'm pregnant.

00:47:12.913 --> 00:47:14.248
- What?
- What?

00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:18.627
That's why I haven't taken
my allergy meds out of caution.

00:47:18.711 --> 00:47:21.088
I cut out coffee
and obviously alcohol.

00:47:21.172 --> 00:47:24.258
It worries me when I work all night
and even when I run.

00:47:24.342 --> 00:47:26.469
Wait. Does Jiseok know about this?

00:47:27.386 --> 00:47:30.264
- Since when? How long has it been?
- They said it's been six weeks.

00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:32.975
I knew all of this already.

00:47:33.976 --> 00:47:35.811
- What?
- What? How?

00:47:35.895 --> 00:47:39.690
You kept checking your period cycle
and spitting your food out.

00:47:39.774 --> 00:47:42.234
- What about Juhyeong?
- When I ran into him at family court,

00:47:42.318 --> 00:47:44.111
I looked up the case number and parties.

00:47:44.195 --> 00:47:46.655
- What about Changwon?
- He told me about it.

00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:48.491
Wow, you're…

00:47:49.158 --> 00:47:50.242
You're amazing.

00:47:53.704 --> 00:47:55.706
Wasn't today supposed to be about me?

00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:57.375
- Why would it be?
- Why you?

00:47:57.458 --> 00:47:59.293
- What about you?
- For what?

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:03.506
I bet you didn't know this,

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:05.424
- but when I was younger…
- We know.

00:48:05.508 --> 00:48:07.927
You wrote a whole essay last night.
No need to pretend.

00:48:08.594 --> 00:48:09.595
You knew about it?

00:48:09.678 --> 00:48:11.931
You put it out there for the world to see.

00:48:12.014 --> 00:48:13.849
- You wanted us to play dumb.
- Hey, hold on.

00:48:13.933 --> 00:48:16.560
- What?
- You took eight years to finish college

00:48:16.644 --> 00:48:17.853
and had a job in between…

00:48:18.604 --> 00:48:20.314
So you never did your military service?

00:48:20.398 --> 00:48:21.899
This punk's been pretending all along!

00:48:21.982 --> 00:48:24.110
I did serve, you idiot! For six months.

00:48:24.193 --> 00:48:25.486
My dad's a national honoree.

00:48:26.404 --> 00:48:29.865
- This won't taste good if it goes cold!
- Yes, ma'am. We'll eat right away.

00:48:30.991 --> 00:48:32.034
Hurry up and eat.

00:48:56.976 --> 00:48:57.977
Hey.

00:48:59.061 --> 00:49:00.062
I…

00:49:03.899 --> 00:49:04.900
I'm sorry.

00:49:04.984 --> 00:49:05.985
It's all right.

00:49:07.903 --> 00:49:09.155
About yesterday…

00:49:09.238 --> 00:49:10.281
Thanks for that.

00:49:13.742 --> 00:49:15.911
I take it back! How embarrassing.

00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:20.958
I didn't mean it either, you punk!

00:49:21.041 --> 00:49:22.793
I cringed before you did, you fool!

00:49:23.419 --> 00:49:25.379
- Okay? Wait for me.
- He's so weird.

00:49:25.463 --> 00:49:27.673
Hey, wait for me.

00:49:30.926 --> 00:49:33.762
I thought you were just
asking me to play dumb.

00:49:33.846 --> 00:49:35.389
But it really wasn't you?

00:49:35.473 --> 00:49:36.474
That's right.

00:49:36.974 --> 00:49:38.934
I told you that it wasn't me.

00:49:39.018 --> 00:49:41.854
Then, why didn't you
just strongly deny it from the start?

00:49:41.937 --> 00:49:44.398
Why wait until after receiving
all those insults?

00:49:44.482 --> 00:49:45.483
What?

00:49:46.650 --> 00:49:48.986
- Did you read all the comments?
- Well…

00:49:49.778 --> 00:49:52.364
I mean, they were everywhere.

00:49:53.532 --> 00:49:55.868
Was it that hard to say it wasn't you?

00:49:55.951 --> 00:49:59.121
That it was just someone else
with a similar name?

00:50:00.915 --> 00:50:02.416
Well, I mean…

00:50:03.042 --> 00:50:04.710
I simply hoped it would pass by.

00:50:06.045 --> 00:50:07.129
I just…

00:50:07.755 --> 00:50:10.174
I didn't want to relive
how I grew up poor,

00:50:10.799 --> 00:50:13.344
and if I denied it too loudly,

00:50:13.427 --> 00:50:15.971
it'd be as if I was bashing
the real guy instead.

00:50:16.055 --> 00:50:17.181
I didn't want that either.

00:50:18.265 --> 00:50:19.642
I didn't know you had such a side.

00:50:20.976 --> 00:50:22.895
I figured you were all about yourself.

00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.691
Yes, it turns out I did have such a side.

00:50:31.403 --> 00:50:32.404
I guess so.

00:50:39.286 --> 00:50:40.287
Come in.

00:50:45.167 --> 00:50:46.168
What are you doing?

00:50:46.252 --> 00:50:47.586
You can't just walk in here.

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:50.130
We're still collaborating
on Kang Changjun's case.

00:50:50.214 --> 00:50:52.675
That case is closed.
We're all done, so why?

00:50:52.758 --> 00:50:55.010
The verdict hasn't been delivered yet.

00:50:55.886 --> 00:50:57.137
- The verdict?
- Let's go.

00:50:57.221 --> 00:50:58.264
Why would we go to that?

00:50:58.347 --> 00:51:01.433
Don't you want to see it?
It's your first collaboration in 10 years.

00:51:01.517 --> 00:51:03.060
Come on, we'll be late.

00:51:03.143 --> 00:51:05.646
I told you it's nine years, not 10.

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:08.148
Fine, nine years.

00:51:08.232 --> 00:51:09.692
We have to hurry.

00:51:09.775 --> 00:51:11.110
Okay.

00:51:12.194 --> 00:51:17.783
Civil case number 2024-25134.

00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:21.912
Plaintiff, Kang Changjun.
Defendant, Lee Dongsu.

00:51:21.996 --> 00:51:23.289
Absent, I presume?

00:51:23.956 --> 00:51:24.957
Present.

00:51:29.044 --> 00:51:31.380
Mr. Kang's side is present?

00:51:31.964 --> 00:51:34.717
- Yes.
- And the plaintiff himself?

00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:35.843
Yes, that's correct.

00:51:35.926 --> 00:51:38.012
All right, here's the ruling.

00:51:38.846 --> 00:51:41.557
The court declares that the termination
issued by the defendant

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:45.477
to the plaintiff on September 3rd, 2024

00:51:46.145 --> 00:51:47.521
is hereby declared invalid.

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:50.441
Court fees are to be paid
by the defendant.

00:51:51.191 --> 00:51:53.110
We rule in favor of the plaintiff.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:55.321
Thank you.

00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:00.242
Civil case number 2024-1987.

00:52:00.326 --> 00:52:02.036
Plaintiff, Butino.

00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:04.496
Defendant, Flip LLC.

00:52:05.289 --> 00:52:06.290
Absent, I presume?

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:10.002
The court orders
that the plaintiff's claim be dismissed.

00:52:10.085 --> 00:52:13.088
Court fees are to be paid
by the plaintiff.

00:52:18.135 --> 00:52:20.679
So? Aren't you glad you came?

00:52:22.139 --> 00:52:25.184
We didn't even do anything.
We were going to win anyways too.

00:52:45.204 --> 00:52:46.372
Damn it.

00:53:21.198 --> 00:53:22.199
Hey.

00:53:22.282 --> 00:53:25.202
Why did you have to
introduce me to Jiseok

00:53:25.285 --> 00:53:27.246
so I'd get me married and now pregnant?

00:53:31.125 --> 00:53:33.085
Why are you getting angry over a blessing?

00:53:33.168 --> 00:53:36.380
A blessing? Says who?
Who are you to decide that?

00:53:36.463 --> 00:53:38.674
By the way, that's up to me.

00:53:39.258 --> 00:53:41.218
But I haven't decided yet, so zip it.

00:53:46.348 --> 00:53:47.433
Damn it.

00:53:48.142 --> 00:53:49.226
Is it really tough?

00:53:50.519 --> 00:53:51.562
It's tough.

00:53:52.563 --> 00:53:54.898
I have so much to worry about
because of this.

00:53:57.484 --> 00:53:59.820
I don't even have any maternal instincts.

00:54:00.487 --> 00:54:02.281
And I doubt I ever will.

00:54:03.365 --> 00:54:04.575
That's it?

00:54:05.325 --> 00:54:07.745
Why do you think
you need maternal instincts?

00:54:07.828 --> 00:54:09.455
Of course, you need them.

00:54:09.955 --> 00:54:11.165
You have to raise a kid.

00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:14.251
But you've always liked people.

00:54:14.334 --> 00:54:16.170
You just have a habit of cursing a lot.

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.464
So you'll love your kid too.

00:54:19.214 --> 00:54:22.301
Why are you so worried?
Does it have to be maternal instincts?

00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:31.310
I've…

00:54:32.227 --> 00:54:33.353
always liked people?

00:54:35.022 --> 00:54:36.398
Yeah. Didn't you know?

00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:43.697
You've been weirdly warm these days.

00:54:45.532 --> 00:54:46.617
No, I haven't.

00:55:25.197 --> 00:55:28.534
Attorney Cho, Jang Sugil is out today.

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:30.827
They said his verdict hearing is today.

00:55:32.287 --> 00:55:33.330
Verdict hearing?

00:55:46.468 --> 00:55:47.553
I mean, goodness.

00:55:47.636 --> 00:55:48.762
You're back.

00:55:52.933 --> 00:55:54.351
Now that I'm seeing you outside,

00:55:54.893 --> 00:55:56.603
you look much better.

00:55:57.604 --> 00:55:58.772
I told you I'd get out.

00:55:58.855 --> 00:55:59.898
He was cleared. Innocent.

00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:03.694
- I see. Congratulations.
- Thank you for these.

00:56:04.278 --> 00:56:05.779
Yes, enjoy.

00:56:06.905 --> 00:56:08.323
I wasn't joking the other day.

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:15.581
Come work for me. I'll take care of you.

00:56:19.001 --> 00:56:20.002
I'll see you again.

00:56:21.795 --> 00:56:23.088
Take this to my office.

00:56:27.259 --> 00:56:28.969
What on earth is the prosecution doing?

00:56:30.137 --> 00:56:31.430
They let him slip through?

00:56:35.142 --> 00:56:36.226
ATTORNEY CHO CHANGWON

00:56:39.646 --> 00:56:43.984
They do have pretty female lawyers here.
Why did they stick me with a guy?

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.575
What the hell's with this lowlife?

00:56:52.367 --> 00:56:53.744
Do you know me?

00:56:54.578 --> 00:56:56.121
Move!

00:56:59.082 --> 00:57:00.083
I'm sorry.

00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:05.672
What was that?

00:57:09.635 --> 00:57:11.136
Do I really like people?

00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:17.643
<i>Everyone, gather up. This one's on me.</i>

00:57:18.143 --> 00:57:19.227
<i>It's a pregnancy party!</i>

00:57:35.702 --> 00:57:37.871
BORING JISEOK

00:57:42.793 --> 00:57:44.753
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Are you home?

00:57:45.712 --> 00:57:48.256
<i>I'm on my way. I'm on the subway.</i>
<i>Are you at the office?</i>

00:57:49.132 --> 00:57:50.217
Yeah, I'm still here.

00:57:51.051 --> 00:57:54.179
- I might be a little late.
<i>- Okay, got it.</i>

00:57:54.971 --> 00:57:55.972
<i>That's why you called?</i>

00:57:57.182 --> 00:57:58.642
- No.
<i>- Then?</i>

00:58:02.396 --> 00:58:03.814
<i>Phone's dying, so make it quick.</i>

00:58:06.608 --> 00:58:08.276
<i>- What? What is it?</i>
- I'm pregnant.

00:58:15.033 --> 00:58:16.034
Hello?

00:58:17.869 --> 00:58:19.538
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- I said I'm pregnant.

00:58:20.205 --> 00:58:21.206
It's been six weeks.

00:58:25.752 --> 00:58:26.753
<i>Right.</i>

00:58:32.676 --> 00:58:33.677
That's it.

00:59:14.009 --> 00:59:16.762
- They're still not here yet?
- No.

00:59:56.968 --> 00:59:58.053
Munjeong.

00:59:58.637 --> 00:59:59.679
Munjeong.

00:59:59.763 --> 01:00:01.807
What's going on?
Why did you suddenly come?

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:03.600
It's just…

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:05.852
Earlier,

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:09.272
I was just so shocked.

01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:10.899
I was in shock.

01:00:11.691 --> 01:00:12.692
Well…

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:20.075
My phone. It ran out of battery and died.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:22.619
Damn it.

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:25.038
I was worried that I startled you.

01:00:27.123 --> 01:00:29.668
Are you crazy? Why are you crying?

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:36.716
I'm sorry. I was just in shock.

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:38.385
Did I scare you?

01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:42.681
I'm so sorry.

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:53.191
So, are you happy that I'm pregnant?

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:54.776
You're happy, right?

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.821
What kind of question is that?
Of course, I am!

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:05.829
- You must be freezing.
- I am.

01:01:05.912 --> 01:01:07.455
Let's hurry home. Come on.

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:13.169
Watch your head.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:23.346
Your seat belt.

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:25.515
My goodness.

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:29.060
It's really cold today, isn't it?

01:01:30.478 --> 01:01:32.355
So you went home and brought the car?

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:34.441
Yeah, I left in such a rush.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:37.736
Drive safe, okay?

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:39.738
You'll get into an accident.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:02.636
Let's eat until we burst!

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:04.763
Geez, you startled me.

01:02:05.597 --> 01:02:07.265
It's a bar, not a restaurant.

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:10.936
Hey, you think we can't stuff ourselves
just because it's a bar?

01:02:11.519 --> 01:02:12.604
What's wrong with you?

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:17.484
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:26.785
I guess you're heading home.

01:02:27.285 --> 01:02:28.286
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:02:31.790 --> 01:02:35.168
You must've had a rough time, Attorney Ha.

01:02:35.835 --> 01:02:37.462
No, not at all.

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:49.432
All right, I'll see you around.

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:51.184
- Good night. Take care, ma'am.
- Good night.

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:11.162
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>but tonight's party is canceled.</i>

01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:13.873
- What?
<i>- Go home. You better not party without me.</i>

01:03:17.752 --> 01:03:19.337
Geez, what's with her?

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:21.089
She said to go home.

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:22.590
I saw it too.

01:03:23.258 --> 01:03:24.426
Come on.

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:28.388
I mean, we could still go
have a drink or something.

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:29.472
Where?

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:31.516
Where?

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:33.476
Are you buying?

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:36.479
Just tell me. Where are we going?

01:03:37.272 --> 01:03:40.734
- Please, just be patient!
- Why should I?

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.152
I followed you all the way here.

01:03:42.235 --> 01:03:43.486
- Hey.
- Just keep following then.

01:03:43.570 --> 01:03:44.863
Everything's closed here.

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:47.532
There's one spot
that will blow your mind.

01:03:47.615 --> 01:03:48.908
SEOKGO BLOOD SAUSAGE SOUP

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.160
What is this place?

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:52.370
What is this? Is it a hidden gem?

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.416
We came all the way here for <i>gukbap?</i>

01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:58.877
Gosh, I'm freezing.

01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:06.551
What are you doing? Say hi to my mom.

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:07.719
What?

01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:09.095
Mom, say hi to my friend.

01:04:10.055 --> 01:04:11.973
- Mom? Your mother?
- Yeah.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:16.770
My goodness.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.813
Ma'am, nice to meet you.

01:04:18.897 --> 01:04:21.274
I'm Cho Changwon. Hello.

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:22.859
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:24.778
I'm Sanggi's close friend.

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:26.613
We always eat lunch together,

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:29.574
drink together,
and pretty much everything together.

01:04:29.657 --> 01:04:30.742
- Have a seat.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:04:30.825 --> 01:04:32.494
Give us food already. It's cold.

01:04:32.577 --> 01:04:34.079
Thank you, ma'am.

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:38.917
Why didn't you tell me
or give me a heads-up?

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.001
This place is legit.

01:04:40.668 --> 01:04:42.754
It's not my mom's.
She works here part-time.

01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:45.340
Geez.

01:04:48.343 --> 01:04:50.678
- Just once.
- I don't want to.

01:04:50.762 --> 01:04:53.181
- Let's just do it once.
- What's wrong with you?

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:55.558
- I want to do it so bad.
- Is this who you really are?

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:57.811
Hey, it's not safe. No.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:00.855
What's not safe?
Just once before the baby gets bigger.

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:03.566
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, hold on.

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:06.277
You just be on the bottom.
I'll be on top.

01:05:06.361 --> 01:05:09.531
No, you never think about
what it's like for me down there.

01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:11.950
- No, please!
- I said no!

01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:15.578
Just a meter, okay?

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:16.746
- Okay.
- You…

01:05:16.830 --> 01:05:19.874
- Just once.
- I'm practically raising a kid.

01:05:19.958 --> 01:05:21.543
- Hey, I'm getting crushed!
- Are you okay?

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:22.919
- My head!
- Are you okay?

01:05:23.002 --> 01:05:24.671
- Are you okay?
- This is so high!

01:05:25.672 --> 01:05:28.675
Hey, hold on tight.
I'm going to lean back.

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:30.510
- Hey, go forward.
- Don't do it!

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:31.636
- Go forward.
- Hey!

01:05:31.719 --> 01:05:34.222
<i>Spider-Man, Spider-Man.</i>

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:36.558
This is crazy!

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.018
- What's so fun about this?
- This is so fun!

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:41.479
Quiet, Munjeong.
The neighbors are going to complain!

01:05:41.563 --> 01:05:42.647
Okay.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:45.984
- Hey! Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

01:05:46.067 --> 01:05:47.068
Be careful.

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:52.782
It's absurd the more I think about it.

01:05:53.408 --> 01:05:55.451
A pregnancy party?
It sounded off from the start.

01:05:56.619 --> 01:05:57.620
Then,

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:01.124
let's call it
a first collaboration victory party.

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:03.877
A first collaboration victory party?

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:06.754
That's a mouthful.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:09.299
So you've never teamed up
with anyone on a case before?

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:11.593
No, I didn't have a reason to.
I'm too good.

01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:15.305
You probably won't either
for another nine years.

01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:18.266
You always keep it to nine years
even though you could say 10.

01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:19.475
Because it's been nine years.

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:31.654
Wasn't this the piece you played?

01:06:33.448 --> 01:06:34.908
You actually remember that?

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:44.042
Shouldn't we have left a little earlier?

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:48.338
But that dim sum place was a must.
I didn't expect traffic to be like this.

01:06:48.963 --> 01:06:50.340
But it was worth it, right?

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:52.467
Yes, it was good.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:53.927
But you should walk faster.

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:56.137
People might think it's my part-time job.

01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:02.727
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm fine. Let's go.

01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:08.942
Get on my back.

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:13.988
- It's okay.
- You're filling in for your friend.

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:15.782
Come on.

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:25.375
There we go.

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:27.126
Hang on tight.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.181
Right.

01:07:40.265 --> 01:07:42.350
Thank you. I'll head in first.

01:07:42.433 --> 01:07:44.102
- Okay, go on.
- Okay.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.064
When did you start playing the piano?

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.149
When I was eight years old.

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:17.945
Was it always your dream to be a pianist?

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:22.367
I think so.

01:09:23.409 --> 01:09:26.954
My parents really loved watching me play.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.541
Seeing them smile made me so happy.

01:09:32.251 --> 01:09:35.713
So their smiles made you want
to become a pianist?

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:38.216
That's right.

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:40.426
It's probably why I keep playing.

01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:46.140
Honestly, it's not like I ever dreamed
of becoming a world-famous pianist.

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:47.767
What about you?

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:51.771
Have you wanted to be a lawyer
since you were a kid?

01:09:52.355 --> 01:09:55.608
It was something else at first.
But it changed as I got older.

01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:59.070
Why? What made you want
to become a lawyer?

01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:03.366
Growing up, I was good at two things.

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:05.410
Arguing and studying.

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:08.913
So becoming a lawyer made sense.

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:12.834
So?

01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:16.003
Do you think you'll become a good one?

01:10:17.046 --> 01:10:18.047
Yes.

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:19.841
That's my dream.

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:22.885
Wait.

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:24.387
Is your ankle okay?

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.640
Yes, I'm feeling much better.

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:31.394
Can you sit for a second?

01:10:51.914 --> 01:10:53.374
Can you put your foot up here?

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:55.626
Really, it's fine.

01:11:13.644 --> 01:11:16.355
Don't you press the pedal
with your right foot?

01:11:17.482 --> 01:11:18.483
I do.

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:19.609
You held up really well.

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:21.444
You don't really notice while playing.

01:11:21.527 --> 01:11:22.820
You're such a professional.

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:26.532
When did you buy these?

01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:31.329
I stepped out
right after the playing started.

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:36.584
All done.

01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:05.947
This place is beautiful by the way.

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:08.032
Yeah, really beautiful.

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:28.761
If there's a spot…

01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:32.682
like this in Seoul,
want to go together?

01:12:33.724 --> 01:12:34.934
Where?

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:38.855
Gangnam Station.

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:43.651
Gangnam Station.

01:12:48.406 --> 01:12:49.407
Sure.

01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:53.160
Okay, then.

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:55.204
Okay.

01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:01.961
But how did you end up being a lawyer?

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:03.838
I figured you'd stick with piano.

01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:10.928
You don't have to say.

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:14.473
No, it's fine.

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:21.814
My dad was running a business back then.

01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:25.067
Thanks to that,
I could comfortably go to school.

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:28.905
But then, he was hit by a huge scam.

01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:31.657
It was some sort of crypto pyramid scheme.

01:13:33.743 --> 01:13:35.953
My family was devastated after that.

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:40.416
Nobody smiled anymore,

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.960
and there was nothing I could do.

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:46.881
So I promised myself

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:48.507
that if anything bad

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:51.594
ever happened to my parents again,

01:13:52.845 --> 01:13:54.931
I'd protect them myself.

01:13:57.058 --> 01:14:00.311
It was overcome well
even though it must've been really tough.

01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:01.395
Yeah.

01:14:01.896 --> 01:14:03.689
My dad's incredibly strong.

01:14:03.773 --> 01:14:05.358
No, I meant you.

01:14:06.984 --> 01:14:07.985
Me?

01:14:09.654 --> 01:14:12.323
Not everyone comes out of such things
thinking like you did.

01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:14.450
You overcame it.

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:16.744
Good job.

01:14:19.497 --> 01:14:20.539
You're right.

01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:22.667
I did a good job.

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:28.756
Everything's better now.

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:30.591
I just want both of my parents

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.386
to stay happy.

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:36.055
That's my dream.

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:38.557
That hasn't changed in 10 years.

01:14:39.767 --> 01:14:41.477
Did I tell you this 10 years ago too?

01:14:42.853 --> 01:14:44.438
You really don't remember a thing.

01:14:44.522 --> 01:14:46.273
I only remember yours.

01:14:46.357 --> 01:14:48.192
You wanted to become a good lawyer.

01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:51.487
It looks like you achieved it.

01:14:58.452 --> 01:15:00.371
I didn't become a good lawyer.

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:02.498
Why not? You are a good lawyer.

01:15:02.581 --> 01:15:04.834
You listen to people who are struggling

01:15:05.376 --> 01:15:07.128
and help them get justice.

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:14.969
To be honest,
I don't see it as helping others.

01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:17.555
I just get paid to fight for them

01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:20.516
with what I see before me.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:24.937
If being a good lawyer
means thinking beyond that,

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:26.022
then I'm not one.

01:15:30.568 --> 01:15:31.610
Still…

01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:36.741
To me,
you're a good senior lawyer.

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:41.162
And a good person.

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:51.547
Thanks.

01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:04.226
Don't you normally take the subway to work
and the bus home?

01:16:04.852 --> 01:16:07.104
Yes, because the subway is always on time.

01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:10.066
And the bus drops me off closer to home.

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:13.903
We're headed toward the subway.
The bus stop's the other way.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:15.863
I know.

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:43.390
You're going back tomorrow, right?

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:45.226
Yes.

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:52.066
Shall we go up?

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:55.778
Sure.

01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:54.290
Law and The City

01:20:22.609 --> 01:20:26.322
Law and The City

01:20:26.405 --> 01:20:29.199
<i>The girl you met on your trip</i>
<i>when you were in law school.</i>

01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:30.492
<i>Wait, you two were a thing?</i>

01:20:30.576 --> 01:20:32.369
He's been into her since Hong Kong--

01:20:32.453 --> 01:20:34.747
Hey! Munjeong is looking for you.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:36.123
<i>Go home if you're drunk.</i>

01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:39.251
<i>- That voice phishing case.</i>
<i>- He said he'd make sure</i>

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:40.753
<i>to help me out to get a loan.</i>

01:20:40.836 --> 01:20:42.921
<i>Normal cases should be easy to represent.</i>

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:44.673
Where do you get this?

01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:46.383
<i>It must be so hard for you.</i>

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:50.137
But do your families really ask
why you're not married?

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:51.305
My goodness!

01:20:51.388 --> 01:20:52.931
<i>Is this your first time in Hong Kong?</i>

01:20:53.474 --> 01:20:55.142
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- When was your favorite moment?</i>

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.936
<i>Now?</i>

01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:08.614
