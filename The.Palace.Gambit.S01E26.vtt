(I'll Wait for You Next Life)

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.840
The ledger seized outside the palace

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.840
details their trafficking.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.160
Please review it.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.440
I've seized Consort Shu's illicit money.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.280
Eunuch Yu, who transported gold for her,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.480
has already confessed.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.256
See for yourself.

00:00:50.656 --> 00:00:52.520
I'm so resentful.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.960
I've schemed with all my might

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.840
and calculated every move,

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.040
yet lost to a lowly maid like you.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.880
When entering the palace at fourteen,

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.200
I became my family's cash cow.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.920
My brother wanted money,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.040
and my father desired power.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.600
I clawed my way upward desperately

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.760
just to earn their notice.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.432
None of this
justifies harming the innocent.

00:01:30.976 --> 00:01:31.800
By what right?

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.760
In this harem,

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.320
everyone vies for favor.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.400
What fault is mine?

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.760
You climbed over innocent lives.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.400
Those commoners you slaughtered

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.920
never got to plead their innocence.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.800
For your own selfish desires,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.320
you've been so malicious.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.600
You are truly heinous.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.480
In the imperial harem,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.920
whose hands are clean?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.680
You all posture with false virtue.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.080
Your Majesty,

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.520
look at these records.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.120
Most of the wealth I amassed

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.360
has been given to your own aunt,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.760
the Grand Princess.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.800
If I'm left with no way out,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.720
the imperial family's dignity

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.000
will be dragged through mud.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.600
Guards!

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.320
Take her down.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.600
Consort Shu,

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.920
don't think I'm blind to your schemes.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.280
You believe the Grand Princess's backing

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.160
makes you invulnerable?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.560
So you dare to blackmail me

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.000
for leniency?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.840
Someone!

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.280
Summon the Grand Princess.

00:02:32.672 --> 00:02:35.328
Summon the Grand Princess.

00:02:41.088 --> 00:02:42.000
The Grand Princess,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.320
I warned you long ago

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.320
to stay away from Consort Shu.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.192
Why did you not heed my warnings?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.040
Your Majesty,

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.560
I admit my wrongs.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.720
Consort Shu

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.504
deliberately bribed me.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.160
I merely accepted her money.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.320
I never got involved

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.200
in what she's done, Your Majesty.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.120
I know nothing

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.600
about what she has done.

00:03:01.408 --> 00:03:02.640
As the Grand Princess,

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.520
my own blood aunt,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.200
of such noble standing,

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.760
you sold yourself for money

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.280
and were drawn

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.600
into her human trafficking crimes.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.240
You've shamed the imperial family.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.640
How do you expect me

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.840
to answer to the court ministers?

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.160
Your Majesty, I was momentarily foolish.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.960
I beg your mercy.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.040
Yun Mi,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.960
help me. I'm your sister.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.000
Yun Mi.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.880
Yun Mi.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.240
Help me quickly.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.920
Persuade His Majesty for me.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.880
This concerns imperial dignity.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.200
How disastrous if made public.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.880
Sister,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.720
with your crimes,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.200
even I cannot save you now.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:44.520
Your Majesty,

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:46.320
the law applies to all,

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.320
high and low.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.080
The Grand Princess took bribes
to cover Consort Shu's crimes.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.960
She must be punished too

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.240
by national law.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.400
As the nation's sovereign,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.920
Your Majesty knows
the empire's foundation.

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.720
If you fail to love your people

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.280
and punish your kin,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.640
where is the authority?

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.520
Water bears the boat

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.320
and capsizes it.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.280
If you lose the people's hearts,

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.240
this empire

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.880
will cease to exist.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.776
Lu Jiuning,

00:04:15.808 --> 00:04:16.520
how dare you!

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.040
Your Majesty,

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.120
justice resides in people's hearts.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.800
It shouldn't rest solely on your decree.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.000
Nor should it

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.960
be confined
to imperial authority and power.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.088
You're overstepping!

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.328
Your Majesty,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.800
though Lu Jiuning
is merely a palace maid,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.520
she cares for the people.

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.120
Her counsel today

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.480
is an act of loyalty.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.320
Please calm down.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.320
Your Majesty, Lu Jiuning

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.400
rescued many oppressed innocent maids

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.600
from Hard-Labor Ward

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.800
while investigating
Talented Lady Wan's case.

00:04:43.104 --> 00:04:44.440
She exposed Consort Shu's crimes

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:45.920
for the greater good.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.440
To expose
the trafficking of common folk,

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.440
she spared no effort.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.600
Every action and thought of Lu Jiuning

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.320
serves the common people

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.960
and Your Majesty's sovereignty.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.400
Please judge fairly.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.440
Very well.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.520
Lord Ning speaks so eloquently.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.800
Today, I shall

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:04.520
deal fairly with Consort Shu
and the Grand Princess.

00:05:06.688 --> 00:05:07.480
However,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.080
to preserve the imperial dignity,

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.360
Lu Jiuning and Eunuch Zhang,
two outsiders who know too much,

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.440
cannot remain.

00:05:15.008 --> 00:05:16.360
They must die.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.960
Your Majesty!

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.952
Bring it forth.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.480
Lu Jiuning,

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.120
I promised you

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.640
a chance to plead your case.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.720
I ask one final time:

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.880
Will you choose life or death?

00:05:34.112 --> 00:05:35.120
The choice is yours.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.440
If Your Majesty

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.160
can administer justice,

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.040
clear my sister's name

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.520
to give her justice,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.360
and restore

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.920
righteous order to the realm,

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.880
I will die without regret.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.960
Good.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.040
Drink this poison,

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.800
and justice shall be served.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.040
Your Highness,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.880
I

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.200
can no longer serve you.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.840
Thank you
for your recognition and kindness.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.768
Thank you for letting me

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.400
feel genuine warmth

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.720
in this cruel palace.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.400
You cherished me like my sister

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.088
and treated me with kindness.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.712
I can never repay you.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.800
See you in the next life.

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.360
In the next life,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.920
I'll surely repay your kindness.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.240
Lord Ning,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.920
thank you

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.160
for always standing by me.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.880
I'm eternally grateful.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.520
Please set aside

00:07:26.464 --> 00:07:27.600
your feelings for me.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:30.240
As things stand,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.680
we can never be together in this life.

00:07:37.184 --> 00:07:38.000
Maybe next life.

00:07:38.976 --> 00:07:39.760
I'll wait for you

00:07:40.352 --> 00:07:41.120
next life.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.320
Next life,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.200
we'll surely

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.760
share our lives

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.880
and grow old together.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.560
No, Jiuning!

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:56.360
My lord!

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.200
Jiuning!

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.400
Jiuning!

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:03.808
No!

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.120
Consort Shu

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.976
harmed consorts and imperial heirs,

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.320
colluded with officials,

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:21.960
and shielded traffickers.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.240
The proof was ironclad.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.360
Her evil was profound.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:25.888
She will

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.120
be stripped of her title

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.200
and given poison

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.320
to atone with death.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:33.600
The Grand Princess

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.960
traded her influence

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.120
for wealth.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:37.560
Effective immediately,

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.960
she's confined to Wuhua Palace.

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.520
Without my decree,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.960
she'll never be pardoned.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:53.960
Jiuning!

00:08:54.688 --> 00:08:55.360
Jiuning?

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.440
Jiuning.

00:09:06.752 --> 00:09:11.200
(Lijing Pavilion)

00:09:18.624 --> 00:09:22.848
(Imperial Study)

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:29.960
I didn't die?

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:35.960
Jiuning,

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.800
you're awake.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.240
Your Highness?

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.160
It was just a sedative tonic.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.760
You slept like a log.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.120
Your Majesty.

00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.160
I never intended to take your life.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.120
I merely wanted to verify

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.920
whether it's, as you claimed,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.560
genuine care for the people,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.360
or just vengeance in disguise

00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:00.000
by borrowing my power.

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:02.920
Thank you for sparing my life.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.600
The human trafficking epidemic

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:05.840
manifested

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.800
through an avalanche of memorials

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040
piling up endlessly.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.760
My tinnitus

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.920
relapsed

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:12.960
during that period.

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.000
Do you truly take me for a fool

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.440
and think me oblivious?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.160
This matter
implicates powerful networks,

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.440
even reaching imperial kin.

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.880
Tug one thread,
and the whole tapestry moves.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.160
Then how

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.720
did Your Majesty resolve to act?

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.800
Because of you.

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.480
As a mere palace maid,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.760
defying power

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:39.880
and obstacles,

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.440
you pleaded for people.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.520
You've shown me

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.760
a remarkable woman unlike any other.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.480
Speak.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.760
What reward do you seek?

00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.760
Your Majesty,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.560
might I request

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.160
leave from the palace?

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.880
I wish to fulfill

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.440
my sister's unachieved dreams.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:12.640
I desire

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.200
to live freely and simply.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:21.280
Very well.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.120
If you insist on departing,

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:25.320
I grant your wish.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.560
Go witness

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.120
the picturesque realm

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.520
under my governance.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.840
Thank you for your grace.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.800
You warned

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.920
Jiuning would never accept me.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.480
I refused to believe

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.960
that in this world

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.360
exists anything beyond my grasp.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.680
Jiuning

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.880
differs from other women.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.200
Indeed.

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.560
I've never encountered
such an extraordinary woman.

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:13.800
Lord Ning,

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.440
have you truly made up your mind?

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.000
My sister faces punishment
because of her.

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.440
The imperial clan

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.680
will never accept her.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.040
Reconsider carefully.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:54.688
(Zhaoyang Gate)

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.440
Your Highness, stay.

00:13:01.376 --> 00:13:02.240
Cease your tears.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:03.640
In your delicate condition,

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.560
weeping harms your eyes.

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.480
I must leave now.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.280
Take good care.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:10.600
Jiuning,

00:13:10.816 --> 00:13:12.040
though palace walls

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.880
may merely separate us,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.960
your departure means

00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.480
we may never meet again.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:18.880
Jiuning,

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:20.360
beyond these walls,

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:21.760
live freely and joyfully

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.000
and fulfill

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.560
both your and your sister's wishes.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:28.520
Your Highness,

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.000
you will become an empress
who embodies maternal grace.

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.280
One as compassionate as you

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.200
as empress

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.160
would bless the realm.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.440
For His Majesty

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:39.520
and our people,

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.760
I'll dedicate my utmost.

00:14:42.144 --> 00:14:44.360
The imperial harem

00:14:44.384 --> 00:14:46.760
forever churns with schemes

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.512
and surging undercurrents.

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:51.960
Speaking of Miss Jiu,
Noble Consort Xian's favorite maid,

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:54.720
from a lowly convict maid
in the Hard-Labor Ward

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.880
to a favored maid by the consort's side,

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.960
her favor flourished effortlessly,

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.520
rising meteorically through the ranks.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.560
Later,

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.800
she not only helped
solve the Jiangnan trafficking case

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.080
but also earned His Majesty's favor

00:15:08.224 --> 00:15:09.520
and was elevated to consort.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.424
Everything was too smooth.

00:15:11.424 --> 00:15:12.499
She became a consort.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.440
But fate plays cruel tricks.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.440
Fortune and misfortune intertwined.

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.560
On the very night

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.000
of her consort ceremony,

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.600
- Miss Jiu...
- What?

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:22.840
Suddenly died.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.880
She died?

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.280
Her corpse vanished,

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.160
leaving only an empty tomb.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.000
Who caused Miss Jiu's

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.640
untimely demise?

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.280
Was her death

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.440
a casualty of palace schemes?

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.040
Are there undisclosed truths?

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:38.640
What truths?

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.160
To know what happened next,

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.200
come back

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.160
for the continuation.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.720
Sister,

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.480
you also came from the palace.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.240
Did Miss Jiu

00:15:48.352 --> 00:15:49.680
truly die?

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.200
Yes.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.320
She's dead.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.840
So the storyteller spoke truth?

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.440
Not entirely true.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.680
One thing he got wrong.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.160
What thing?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.200
Miss Jiu

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.280
was never a consort of His Majesty.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.480
Then what?

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:13.880
Then

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.560
if you don't go home to eat soon,

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.040
you'll miss dinner.

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.520
It's getting late.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:20.760
At the bridge's end,

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.880
a scholar in blue

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.960
holding an umbrella hurries over...

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:44.640
Jiuning.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.640
Lord Ning?

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.480
I'm no Lord Ning now.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.480
I incurred the wrath

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.680
of the imperial clan.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:54.680
Now I'm stripped

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.720
of royal status and lineage.

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:58.960
Henceforth,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.360
no Lord Ning exists.

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.480
Before you stands

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:04.840
but a commoner.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:10.560
Jiuning,

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:12.760
in our youth,

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.080
you shielded me.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.080
Now I'll protect you.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.080
I'll marry you

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.480
and guard you all my days.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.200
None shall harm you again.

00:17:26.272 --> 00:17:30.496
♪For you, I am willing♪

00:17:30.624 --> 00:17:36.288
♪Do you understand♪

00:17:45.152 --> 00:17:49.216
(The End)
