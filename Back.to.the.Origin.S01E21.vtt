00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.240
[Your package!]

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.400
I'll just leave it here.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.039
Thanks.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.320
Hi there.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.600
Cake delivery for your office.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.759
The receipt blew away.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:01:59.600
I'm running late...

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.280
Just put it over there.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.960
Appreciate it.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.960
Do you remember who ordered it?

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.240
It's a "Ran".

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.200
"Ran"?

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.840
Hello, Xiaohe?

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.320
Is Anran live streaming right now?

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.320
Could you come over

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.280
and grab her cake?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.360
Xiaohe.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.840
Xiaohe!

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.720
Hi, Xiaohe.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.440
Xiaohe! Hey, Xiaohe!

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.160
Xiaohe!

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.120
Hello, Xiaohe.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.079
Xiaohe?

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.920
Xiaohe.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.400
What's this?

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.000
Anran.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.200
The office got you a cake.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.560
Seriously?

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.400
[Don't they]

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.800
[know you're dieting lately?]

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.880
Definitely.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.440
I've put on weight.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.080
But when the company sends a cake,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.640
you have to try a bite, right?

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.280
[True.]

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.280
Just one bite.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.960
You guys can have the rest.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.400
What?

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.720
Why are you closing it?

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.680
It's just...

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:38.520
These need to be

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:39.320
in the same order

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.120
as the links.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.840
Otherwise,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.280
it's a real problem...

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.240
This... does this belong here?

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.440
But this one's pricier.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.360
This should be here.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.120
Sort them by price?

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.960
Yeah, by price.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.000
Easier to pick up this way.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.040
Besides sequencing,

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.840
you gotta practice.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:50.960
What if we fumble

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.240
during the demo?

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.160
What will people think?

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.720
High pressure, instant unclogging.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.160
No more backed-up toilet.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:58.400
Just go get the package.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.360
Stop it, you're sucking

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.160
the desk right in.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.640
- Anran?
- [Liu Bo?]

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.880
[Busy?]

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.800
Product selection.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.640
Your bangs are all over the place.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.080
[Zhang Ran?]

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.880
Yes?

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.040
Is that for me?

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.840
The office ordered you a cake.

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.760
It wasn't me.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.680
Oh, thank you.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.839
Here's to skyrocketing metrics.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.519
Oh, no "skyrocketing" expected.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.000
Just a lucky streak.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.440
I don't think so.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.520
You just got here

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.000
and already pulled those numbers.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.320
That's not just luck.

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.240
You've got the skills.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.360
Well... because

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.880
I frequented your live room.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.480
Th-thanks for showing me the ropes.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.240
How diplomatic.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.360
The thing is,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.920
lots of people in my room

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.760
never reached

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.840
the heights you did.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.360
That's about you.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.560
Just joking!

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.840
Alright, I'll leave you to it.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:45.400
Sure thing.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.040
Okay, thanks.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.280
Let me slice you a piece.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.920
Have a slice.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.040
No, I'm off sugar.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.040
Not having any?

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.680
I'll pass.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.320
Alright.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.880
See you.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.680
Bye.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.440
I was just teasing.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.440
It's fine.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.800
Hey, did your package arrive?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I've looked everywhere.

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.560
Check this out.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.120
It says "signed and taken".

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.840
Cut the cake first.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.720
Okay.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.280
It does say "delivered".

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:18.120
Does it?

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.960
Isn't it there?

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.240
No, I checked the whole place.

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.880
Hey, I'm—

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.800
[Are there a bunch of]

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.400
[boxes at our front door?]

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:47.880
I think I'm right

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.480
staring

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.400
at them now.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.400
And I'm trapped by them inside.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.280
[Honey, help me bring them in.]

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.400
[Be careful with them.]

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.800
They're gifts

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.600
for the team.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.640
Okay, but first I need

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:00.800
to get out of here.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.160
Should I drop them off

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.080
at your office later?

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.560
[Actually, don't worry.]

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:05.880
I'll send Liu Bo over tonight

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:06.440
to get them.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:08.520
A few of those boxes

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.640
are gifts for our parents.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.400
Don't mix them up.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.760
We'll sort through them later.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.000
[Okay, honey. Bye.]

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.920
Got it.

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:35.000
Whoa.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.240
What about these?

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.040
Gold frames.

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.120
Do they make me look... cheeky?

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.120
I think they look smart.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.560
They do?

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.040
What's wrong?

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.280
I looked ghastly white.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.240
Nonsense.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.000
We haven't even started yet.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:54.880
See for yourself.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:55.960
My face and my neck

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:56.680
don't even match.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.280
Think about those TV actors.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.320
They slather on

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.440
layer after layer,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.800
[like a wall heavily plastered.]

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.520
Refrained from looking down

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:04.520
in case the makeup flakes off.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.600
Yours is nearly natural.

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.240
Let me see.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.440
[It's not working.]

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.480
[Yes, it will work.]

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.200
Michael.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.640
Yes, Mr. Li?

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.440
Come take a look.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.400
Is the makeup heavy?

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.720
Not at all.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.720
I'm as pale as a ghost.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.320
[Can't even tell the difference, can you?]

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.080
[Right?]

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:23.160
I think Mr. Li is right.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.840
Go on. Do him up.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.800
Mr. Li, I need to go...

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:26.840
Okay.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.960
Do not cover his wrinkles.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.640
They are part of the look.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.840
Can't do it anyway.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.680
I'm not sure about

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.240
the eyebrows...

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.920
[Perhaps don't arch them upwards.]

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.320
[His brows are like this now.]

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.880
[Just a tiny bit up will do.]

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:42.200
You know the likeness of Wenquxing, the god of literature?

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.360
That brow... after it dips down,

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.200
there's a slight...

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:44.640
upward...

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.600
You mean the Lord of Way and Virtue?

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.040
[No, no!]

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.520
[I'm saying Wenquxing.]

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.600
[It's like, it's...]

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:50.880
Watch me.

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:51.560
Comes from here...

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.800
Then downwards here...

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:53.720
Hold still.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.840
After that...

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:55.720
Stop moving!

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.760
Stop fiddling with his stuff!

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.320
You have no idea.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.040
[Put it down.]

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:00.680
Michael.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:01.760
Michael?

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:03.120
[Yes?]

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.920
What do you think?

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.440
Feels like it's still missing something.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.160
Just follow Mr. Li's lead.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:08.880
Okay.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.920
Relax. You're good.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.600
Just relax.

00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.720
Too stiff. Loosen up.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.800
Will you stop twitching your mouth?

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:29.120
Stop picking at it.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.440
[It's itchy. There's fuzz.]

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.520
[Just hold on a sec.]

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:33.080
Hands in your pockets.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.039
Pockets?

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.640
Your pants' pockets, man.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:37.720
[Yes.]

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:39.480
Curve

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:40.559
your lips.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.640
Adjust

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.520
[your tie.]

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.120
See?

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.240
Looks sharp.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.320
Yeah, really sharp.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.440
[Touch your]

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.200
[head.]

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.040
Mr. Li! Mr. Li.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:52.640
Mr. Li.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:53.600
Let Johnny do it.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.280
Come over here.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:54.880
Alright.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:55.360
No problem.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:55.880
Like this?

00:08:59.000 --> 00:08:59.640
[Sideways,]

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.680
[a bit more toward me.]

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.760
Like you're pondering.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.960
Deep in thought.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:09.920
And... got it.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.800
Smile, dude.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.520
What?

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.440
"Nobody but you."

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:24.360
Will this work?

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:29.880
Against the pillar.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.840
Could you smile?

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.280
That's it.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.160
What do you think, Michael?

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:41.520
Mr. Li, your thoughts?

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.240
I think it's perfect.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.560
I agree.

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:49.960
My idea!

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.640
...Tossed to the trash bin,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.760
sending the whole room laugh.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.840
What's so funny?

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:09.600
Hey, you're back.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:10.240
I'm home.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:11.880
What are you up to?

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:14.600
Working on this proposal.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.040
[Here.]

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.560
[Brought you some sea intestine and rice.]

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:21.800
Watch me.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.240
Let me think.

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.560
What's for my next project?

00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.600
Got it.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.400
Do I look scholarly?

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.160
Li Daoqi showed me.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:30.880
Honey...

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.400
Yeah?

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.600
You look like a spy.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.880
A spy?

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.520
Am I not academic?

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.760
Answer me.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.120
What... what are you doing now?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.600
[Have we got dish soap?]

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.520
What?

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.320
W-wait a minute.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.960
Are you gonna wash your face?

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.440
I need to get this off.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.400
With dish soap?

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.320
Are you serious?

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.280
How else?

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.600
I just tried water.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:51.960
Wait.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.400
Not working.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.760
Don't! Don't get it wet yet.

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.640
Just don't...

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.120
A moment.

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.760
Shouldn't I... rinse it first?

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.000
[No! No water—stop it!]

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.480
Feels awful.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.120
No water.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.280
I'm just gonna rinse this off first...

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.240
Oh my god. Honey.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.400
You're unbelievable.

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:07.640
No, I've got to...

00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.000
Water

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.360
is spilling everywhere.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.040
I'll... I'll wash it like this.

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.360
Ouch! Cramps.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.400
You're a handful.

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.000
Where is it?

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.040
Here.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.040
My hip.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:21.960
Okay.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.360
Now, put some in your palm.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:24.640
And rub it.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.240
Yeah, that's it.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:27.640
Spread over and

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.360
massage your face in circles, gently.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.000
Circles.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.000
Like this?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.480
That's it.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.720
Honestly, with

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.320
all the makeup and removal,

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:36.600
it must be exhausting

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.240
being women.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.680
Of course it's hard being a woman.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.400
Gaining weight means no discipline.

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.960
Losing weight, unhealthy.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.320
[No makeup, you're ugly.]

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.040
[With makeup, you're too coquettish.]

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.040
Don't have kids?

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.640
Shirking social responsibility.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.280
Have kids?

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.560
You're neglecting your career.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.440
Bottom line:

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.920
It's all her fault.

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.440
Women have it the toughest.

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.400
That was

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.080
incisive.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:56.680
How about making

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:57.520
a roasting video out of it?

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.480
They just want me to play the fool.

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:04.160
You know what?

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:05.040
Before...

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:05.400
Keep rubbing.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.280
Do I have to?

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:07.640
Yes.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.680
My skin's gonna get raw.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.720
A few more minutes.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:10.760
I think you used to be

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.560
pretty great.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.240
Like...

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:13.240
Full speed ahead

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.520
all the time.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720
You were an influencer.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.880
How did you end up

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.040
second-guessing

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.240
everything?

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.960
This job's eating away at you.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:27.400
Shall we change it?

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.400
Or at least,

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.400
take a break.

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.200
Alright?

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.200
You want me to

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.160
be a housewife?

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.520
To hell with it.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:34.800
I have to make something of my own.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.320
Look at the people at my company.

00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.800
They're not that great.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:39.440
How come

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.680
they're all riding high?

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.600
Am I missing a nose

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.560
or eyes to do the same?

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.760
[I'm highly educated.]

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.320
[There's]

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.280
[gotta be some way.]

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.040
I swear.

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:46.920
I won't give up.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.480
Now that's the queen.

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.760
You're making a comeback.

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.120
Just forge ahead.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:53.880
It's nothing.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.120
What's that saying...

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.400
The one in your

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:57.960
neighborhood:

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.560
"No guts, no glory."

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:03.840
Stick to it!

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.560
You can do it.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.720
Let's go!

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.800
It just hit me...

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.480
It's pretty lucky being a guy.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.920
No daily makeup,

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.800
no daily skincare.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.480
You know, a crew came swarming

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.120
around me during the photo shooting.

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:21.920
I was so annoyed.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.000
So very annoyed.

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.400
But I had to play along

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.040
for the shoot.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:27.560
Honey?

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.440
It's really not easy.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.120
Thank you.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:31.520
Don't mention it.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:32.760
For our family,

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.000
it's no trouble.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.120
Let's go for it!

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.360
We're wasting water. That's it.

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:38.760
Am I clean?

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:39.560
Yeah.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:40.720
You are.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.960
[Look who's home.]

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.360
To be honest, I'm feeling pretty rough,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.000
but I'm delighted

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.600
to tell you

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.320
I brought a fine bottle of wine for you.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.520
You know what time it is?

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.240
[Fine wine!]

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:27.760
What time?

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.840
Go ahead, tell me.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.840
Past one o'clock.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.560
Keep your voice down.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.080
Don't wake the baby.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.600
It's past one, so be quiet.

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.040
Can't wake the baby.

[Since you're up,]

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.040

[a little nightcap?]

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.280
[It's good stuff.]

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.240
Daoqi,

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.760
can you not

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.040
come home so late anymore?

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.720
I know the business's keeping you,

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.680
but I assume

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.320
today's not about work at all.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.160
[You are right.]

00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.880
But it was just as draining.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:52.960
Today, Xing Kai

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.040
took us to this

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.000
weird castle

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.440
to meet some odd people.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.600
Daoqi, I-I don't care.

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.480
I'm not interested.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.880
I just want to say,

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.400
[from now on,]

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.960
[don't come home this late.]

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:03.640
You're messing up

00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.160
Nian's

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.280
and my routine.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.640
I have a plan. Best of both worlds.

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.400
We move.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.880
We move next to my office.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.120
[Then I can pop back home]

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:12.960
[during lunch.]

[No. Cut it.]

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.760
This is just drunk talk.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.960
We're not discussing this.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.200
Go take a shower.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.240
I'm going to bed.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.680
Okay, I'll shower.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.920
And I will shower

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.400
without disturbing anyone's sleep.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.640
Now that's a challenge.

00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.040
Keep it down.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.800
Alrighty.

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:36.240
Anran, you're the best.

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.480
Another one of the countless lifts.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.200
It's on my way.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.000
Can I try this?

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:42.520
Here.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.600
New samples from

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.360
the business development team.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.160
Right.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.000
Smells nice.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:48.960
Osmanthus.

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:50.800
Citrus.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.720
And a hint of peach.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:54.560
Yes.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.200
About the Lady Tiger deal,

00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:59.040
I really appreciate it that

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.600
you're happy for me.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.080
[I'll keep telling others]

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.800
[Anran has the biggest heart.]

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.320
Alright, enough.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.000
I often think about

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:10.920
how I can repay you.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.040
You've been so good to me.

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:13.080
You're such a

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.000
major influencer.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.840
You could've shrugged

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.680
off a small-time chatterbox like me.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:18.720
Once I'm doing better,

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.000
I'll try my best to give back

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:20.760
to your channel.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.000
For real.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.560
I can't just take without giving back.

00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.280
Right?

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.840
Believe me.

00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.880
What's good about me is that

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.680
I always pay back.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.480
Appreciate the sentiment.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.520
Once you're hot,

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.240
the opportunities follow.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.960
Seize the moment.

00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:39.800
If you make it now,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.200
you're set.

What's this?

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.280
For you.

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.360
Tired?

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.240
Want a nightcap?

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.560
I'm chattering like a clown

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:24.920
And here you are,

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.040
How unfair is that?

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:28.560
Don't get worked up.

00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.320
It was a gift.

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.000
For you? Why? How?

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:35.320
Why'd they pamper you?

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.760
I'm the CEO.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.600
That's the reason.

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:41.760
Come on.

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.920
Let's taste success.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.240
We're not sending this

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.240
as a present to others?

00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.920
You're my number one VIP.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:50.960
I'm giving it to you.

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.000
Well?

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.680
In my expert opinion...

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.640
this wine

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.920
has certain...

00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.560
notes of earth

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:18.480
on the palate,

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:20.440
mingled with a formaldehyde bouquet.

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.200
How can earth and formaldehyde

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.400
produce any bouquet?

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.200
Never mind.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:24.840
[I'm saying,]

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.960
[how does this compare]

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.840
[to the shots in Canada?]

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.880
Different thing.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:28.960
The ones sold in Canada

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.920
are over twenty dollars a bottle.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.880
Different taste.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.320
They must be making good money.

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.040
Who?

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:37.320
No one.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.400
If the wine is that good,

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.120
we should savor it properly.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:44.680
Okay.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:47.480
Here.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.400
Back when I was at the TV station,

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.200
I hated the office politics.

00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.360
Here I am, right back in it again.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.360
Back again.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.760
Lady Tiger's video

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.280
only made me happy for one day.

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:09.520
Less than twenty-four hours.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.680
Am I stupid or what?

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:12.560
I should have seen

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.440
through what Mr. Lin

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.160
was really saying.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.440
What was he praising me for?

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:17.280
He was praising me

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:18.760
just to put Lin Anran down.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:20.160
So I'm nothing.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.800
I'm just a prop they used.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.960
Aren't they tired of fighting like this?

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.160
Tired? But they're making money.

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.080
They get tired,

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.400
but they put real money in their pockets.

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.520
I get tired and I...

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.120
For my measly little bit.

00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.200
Who knows

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.600
when I'll be sacrificed again.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:36.000
That's not going to happen.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.640
Are you overthinking it?

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.680
If I didn't overthink,

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.320
I will end up just like Miss Liao.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.200
So what if you get banned?

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.560
I can take care of you.

00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.760
I'm a CEO now.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:50.960
How big of a deal

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.120
is this CEO anyway?

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.240
Can it handle UFOs?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.880
Don't interrupt.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.200
Listen,

00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.200
being CEO

00:20:57.200 --> 00:20:58.600
has been feeling really good lately.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.520
I go to business dinners every day.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.760
This really opened my eyes.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.320
Xing.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.920
Xing Kai, the one I told you before.

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.280
He's the king of dinners.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.840
At a dinner recently,

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.840
to make everyone happy,

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.640
guess who

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.840
he invited?

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.440
Soccer star Messi?

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.480
Not that big.

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.080
He invited an opera singer.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:19.480
The singing...

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:20.960
So refined.

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.400
Don't you believe me?

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:26.120
When that girl arrived,

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.000
she didn't eat or drink.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:27.760
Just stood up and started singing.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.000
♪Memory.♪

00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.520
Is she playing a painted-face role?

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:36.360
Get down from there.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.800
Don't break my chair.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.040
Can you nouveau riches

00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.120
appreciate the opera?

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.040
It's ridiculous.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:43.160
What a waste of opera.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.560
That's what I thought.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.520
But honestly,

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.160
you have to admire her.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.120
That girl knew perfectly well

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.480
no one at the table

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.360
could understand her.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.080
But she still sang

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.320
with such confidence.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.360
What kind of quality is that?

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.120
An actor's quality.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.520
And

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.120
the singing

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.160
was just the appetizer.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.680
There was even a tour.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.320
Why whisper? Is someone else there?

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.080
What do you mean, tour?

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.120
I'm almost embarrassed to say.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:18.920
Hey,

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.080
here I am, huffing and puffing,

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:23.040
making faces as an influencer.

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.800
And you're living this life?

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.520
This must be

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.640
the CEO life.

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.800
Listen, if you ever

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:31.960
get really famous,

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.000
I bet you'll feel

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.960
way better than this.

00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.440
Give me another hundred bucks worth.

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.800
I can get famous.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.480
What about you?

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.760
Are you planning to

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.600
keep making this kind of videos?

00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.240
You watched it?

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.600
I think it's really hard for you.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.440
If it gets too much, just quit.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.200
I'll take care of you.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.080
I have

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:09.040
my own career now.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:09.800
Don't laugh.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.920
I'm serious.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:13.120
I just want you to be

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:14.640
happy and relaxed.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.080
If it really doesn't work out,

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:17.440
just treat it as a hobby.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.800
You don't need to

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.160
play those mind games

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.160
with those guys

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:22.640
and worry about all that nonsense.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.320
I'm okay for now.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.240
Being a sidekick to a big influencer

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.440
isn't so bad.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.400
Not tiring.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.120
Honey,

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.280
the wine you brought is good.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.040
If you get tired,

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.080
just tell me.

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.320
I'm here.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.360
Okay.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.160
Watch,

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.600
I can tap

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.480
at the same speed as the second hand.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.200
Do you believe it?

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.360
Look.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.480
Reminds me of when you did your makeup.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.240
It got faster

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.200
and faster.

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.640
How fun.

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.040
You jerk.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.400
Are you Zhang Ran

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.960
from the Financial Talk?

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.240
I am.

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.680
No wonder you look

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.600
so familiar.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.560
You look almost the same

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.680
as ten years ago.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.080
Do I?

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:48.800
I used to

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.160
watch your show all the time.

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.320
Your English was so good.

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.640
I even had my daughter watch it

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.480
to practice her speaking.

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:56.560
Thank you.

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.760
Thank you and your family.

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.400
Are you still a host?

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:00.920
No.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.280
I quit many years ago.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:03.840
What a shame.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.000
Such a pity.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.520
I've already paid

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.200
on the app.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.760
Could you give me your autograph?

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.960
But I'm not doing it anymore.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.600
You might get famous again someday.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.880
You never know, right?

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:26.120
Please, sign this for me.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:26.840
Thank you.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.120
Sir, I'll leave it here.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.080
Okay, just put it here.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.600
Thank you.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.280
[Manage your time well.]

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.120
[First, we handle all the detailed plans]

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.400
[for the first half of the year...]

00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:28.720
[Right.]

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.880
[We... We shouldn't]

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.000
[rush into things.]

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.720
[I'll call you back later.]

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.040
Mr. Fu, you're here.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.640
What's wrong, Mr. Fu?

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:48.040
What is this?

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.400
Actually,

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.920
these are very normal

00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:54.280
marketing tactics.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.520
After all, our brand

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:56.560
is built on the expertise

00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.840
of Dr. Fu.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.960
So we

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.120
just want the public

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.200
to see your background

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.720
and education

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:04.080
more clearly.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.040
This is

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:05.920
one of our features.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.800
It's also a highlight.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.160
I have real degrees

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.080
and experience.

00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.400
And related photos.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:11.000
But now

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
you've turned it into this.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:12.800
Even real ones

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.560
will look fake

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.400
this way!

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.720
What were you thinking?

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:29.920
[Yao!]

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:30.880
[Come here!]

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.160
I gave you the full plan.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.520
And you just edited the pics like this?

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.040
Do you even have any taste?

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:48.280
All of Dr. Fu's work experience

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.440
and degrees

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.080
are real!

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.080
But you made them look fake!

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.640
What kind of work attitude is this?

00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.000
Get out!

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.720
No sense of quality at all.

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:07.160
Mr. Fu,

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.480
I might need you

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:10.680
to send me some

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.800
of your old photos later,

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.960
so I can push them

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.400
to redo our materials properly.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.760
This

00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:17.720
was my oversight.

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.400
It won't

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.480
happen again.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:21.400
I'm sorry, Mr. Fu.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:46.200
I'm sorry

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.640
for the trouble.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:48.720
My fault.

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.440
Go ahead then.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:27.520
Wear this makeup next time.

00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:28.200
It looks good.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.000
Ms. Qian!

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.600
Anran.

00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.680
Haven't seen you in a few days.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.040
I have a planning meeting now.

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:35.800
Sit in

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.040
and give me some guidance.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.440
You don't need my guidance.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.880
I love whatever you do.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:42.160
Ms. Qian,

00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.960
Mr. Lin is in the meeting room.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.000
Okay. I know.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:46.920
I'll head over.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:49.600
Anran, I'm going to the meeting.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.720
I'll come see you later.

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.280
Okay.

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.600
Only novices need guidance.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:00.600
We don't need it.

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.160
Let's go.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.160
Okay, everyone's here.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.600
This meeting is

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.360
about the proposal

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:36.920
for the streamer's video.

00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:38.400
Recently,

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.600
our tech team

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.680
provided some data.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.800
On points netizens

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:43.760
are currently interested in.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.760
Workplace topics are trending.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.480
So we want to make some

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.560
related

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.800
funny videos.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.160
Mainly continuing

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.920
Ran's "Desperate" series theme.

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:54.440
Excuse me,

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:55.440
let me interrupt for a second.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.720
I don't mean to disrespect

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.280
anyone's work.

00:30:58.760 --> 00:30:59.600
I just think

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.600
this kind of joke

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.800
could be a bit...

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.880
improved.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.280
Let's not make it so...

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.960
I mean, could we make it

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.040
a bit more sophisticated?

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.440
Your video with Lady Tiger

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.000
was great.

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.080
I... I feel like this kind of

00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.280
over-the-top silliness

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.120
isn't really good.

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:20.080
How is it over-the-top silliness?

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.520
We make short videos

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:22.680
just to give people

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.000
some entertainment.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.600
We're not making art.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.200
Of course, we respect the content

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.200
and the audience.

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.920
Buy a coffee,

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.040
and half of it is ice.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.240
They really know how to run a business.

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.360
Don't get theirs anymore.

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.840
If Zhang Ran has issues

00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.720
with this proposal, it's not

00:31:57.800 --> 00:31:59.320
that she's afraid of looking bad.

00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.440
It's just that the humor

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.080
isn't strong enough.

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.720
It doesn't meet

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.520
her standards for content quality.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.400
Right, Zhang Ran?

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.200
Not really.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:12.000
I think I jumped into this field

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:12.720
too hastily.

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.160
Don't worry.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.640
Your improvement

00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:18.000
is the company's greatest asset.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:20.560
I support you.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.040
Okay, we'll go back and think about it.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.240
Go back and think about it.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:28.800
I've

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.800
already come up with a new proposal.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.000
Can you hear me?

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:44.280
Being an influencer is tough.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.680
Zhang Ran.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:08.199
I've kept this wine

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:09.800
for twenty years.

00:34:10.719 --> 00:34:13.199
It's for the person I value most.

00:34:13.719 --> 00:34:14.600
You should've said so.

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.960
Then I wouldn't have drunk it like this.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.960
I don't deserve such good wine.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.360
You deserve even better.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:38.320
Just the two of us tonight.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:41.440
Let's talk straight.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.960
Absolutely. Every word

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.480
will be the truth.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.760
Back when

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.199
you were a host,

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:54.520
you stood in front of the camera

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:55.560
reading lines

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.600
written by others,

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.000
saying things

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.080
you might not even agree with.

00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.080
Even then,

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:12.480
I could see your spark.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.040
Your professionalism,

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:18.240
your drive,

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:21.240
and your cultural depth

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:24.320
are all your assets.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.720
This era will be yours sooner or later.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:36.240
Thank you.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.360
Mr. Lin,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.320
I've been drinking tonight.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.240
Honestly,

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.040
on my first day at the company,

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.960
Ms. Qian

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:51.720
showed me around.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.360
Watching all those people

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.120
in their little cubicles

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.400
doing their things,

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:56.640
I felt like I couldn't do any of it.

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.080
Out loud I...

00:35:58.080 --> 00:35:59.760
I said I was impressed.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.560
But inside, I was completely hopeless.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.120
I thought I couldn't do it.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.360
I couldn't do any of it.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.680
But I came all the way back here.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.880
What was I supposed to do?

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.400
That day we were brainstorming,

00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:11.880
you were stirring

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.880
a cup full

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.680
of ice.

00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.120
I had a lot bottled up inside

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.280
that day.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.640
I didn't say it.

00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.280
I didn't want to do it.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.920
And I think you could tell

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:21.800
I didn't want to.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.000
Why didn't I want to?

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.160
I haven't

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.200
told anyone this.

00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.520
Tonight is the first time.

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:28.760
Truthfully,

00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.320
I looked down on this industry.

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.040
But I want to say,

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.760
your plan

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.440
has had great results.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.680
It is

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:41.640
a plain fact.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.480
I went back and reflected.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.560
Since I

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.320
chose this profession,

00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:48.840
I have to do it well.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.120
I need to respect it.

00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:53.280
That's what I told myself.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.920
So I want to say I trust you.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.440
Whatever you say, I'll do.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.280
Alright?

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.560
Many people had proper jobs

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.280
before becoming influencers.

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:14.280
They felt like this

00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:17.200
lowered their status.

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.000
But look,

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.800
the world is so competitive now.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.440
Everyone's so anxious.

00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.760
They can only

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.680
find a bit of joy

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.360
through our videos.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.760
We're the psychologists

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.240
of this era.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.520
I've been

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.840
through all the lows you have.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.720
I found this smartwatch

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:09.080
for you.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.560
A dark horse domestic brand this year.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:16.560
Since you trust me,

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.280
I will lift you up.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.240
Alright?

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:26.680
Mr. Lin,

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:29.440
so I don't have to

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:31.000
do those pots

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.320
and plungers anymore, right?

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.840
That's what you mean, right?

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.040
Mr. Lin,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.480
I've been drinking tonight.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.400
I'm not going to pledge my loyalty.

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.320
Don't listen

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.160
to what a person says.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.120
Watch what they do.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:57.560
Just watch what I do.

00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.320
Whatever it takes to succeed, I'll do.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:01.760
Alright?

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:21.200
Thank you.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:26.000
Thank you.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:32.960
-Fu Yudong!

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.720
-Fu Yudong!

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.840
-Fu Yudong!

00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.360
Where did you go?

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.600
Why are you so drunk?

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.480
Am I home?

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.920
Am I home yet?

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:50.920
Come on.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:51.800
Am I home?

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.640
Don't panic.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.800
Snap a photo and post on social media.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.440
Come on.

00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.280
Fu Yudong.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:58.480
Get up.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:39:59.840
Let's take your bag off first.

00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.560
Careful. Duck your head.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.760
Careful.

00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.520
One, two, three, up.

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.480
Let's go.

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.200
To the room.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.200
I'm fine.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:08.120
I know you're fine.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.440
I'm going to show you

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.800
I'm an alien now.

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:11.600
Okay, alien.

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.400
From which planet?

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.240
From the Musha Musha planet.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.680
What's the Musha Musha planet?

00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.480
Don't pull me.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.320
I know you're pulling me.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.360
Well,

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.360
see this?

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.760
The company gave me new products.

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.240
Finally, I don't have to

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:25.720
deal with pots and pans anymore.

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:26.160
That's impressive.

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:26.920
Now...

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.840
Now I can pick anything I want.

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.200
These watches are all really good.

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.920
It can monitor

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:34.520
your heart rate,

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:38.600
blood lipids, and height.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:39.960
Well, not height.

00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:41.080
The moment I saw it,

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.360
I wanted to get it for you.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.040
Because you're tired.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.640
Honey, you're tired.

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.040
I wanted you

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.360
to wear this.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.040
So, it can watch over you,

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.520
see if you're tired

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.840
and if you need to rest.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.160
Now listen to me.

00:40:56.200 --> 00:40:57.160
Do as I do.

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:58.840
Watch me.

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.320
Let's test it.

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:00.840
First, sleep.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.960
We'll test tomorrow, okay?

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:02.720
Please.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.120
Test it with me.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:05.680
We'll do it like this.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:06.640
Like what?

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:07.920
Plank.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:09.360
Is this a plank?

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.600
Plank.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.280
Hold it steady.

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.160
Okay.

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.280
It will show your heart rate

00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.800
and stuff.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.040
It

00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:21.200
keeps an eye on your health

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:23.120
through your heart rate.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.200
Ready, go!

00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:25.400
Starting now!

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.440
Why isn't it moving?

00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:30.920
I think

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.080
either the watch is broken,

00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:32.960
or I am.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.360
But it's probably

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:35.920
the watch.

00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.080
The watch is broken?

00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.360
Fu Yudong.

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:44.600
We were so happy

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.960
back in Canada.

00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.560
I often think about how we used to

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:54.280
smile a lot.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.480
Back then, we had no money.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:05.000
Things in the house kept breaking.

00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.640
The toilet kept overflowing.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:09.960
And the power went out.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.160
All the dirty, hard work

00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.560
was done by you.

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.280
Honey,

00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:21.040
I'm going to make it big soon.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.400
Once I do,

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.600
I won't let you do these things anymore.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.000
I'll let you enjoy life.

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.600
I'll let you just lie around all day.

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:36.800
Okay.

00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.240
Honey, you're amazing now.

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.240
From now on, you take care of me!

00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:43.000
I'll take care of you.

00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:46.560
I'll take care of you, Fu Yudong.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:50.120
I'll take care of you.

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:50.800
Zhang Ran.

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:52.560
Are we done?

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.760
I'll take care of you.

00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:55.800
Isn't it about time?

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.520
I can't hold

00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:59.280
the plank any longer.

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.560
Zhang Ran?
