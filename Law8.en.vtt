WEBVTT

00:01:34.386 --> 00:01:35.429
Mom!

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:38.682
- What's going on?
- Your dad was leaving for work.

00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.434
But the police came
and arrested him.

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:42.436
Why would they arrest Dad?

00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:48.317
Actually, he'd been sued
and was being investigated.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:50.235
What?

00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:53.906
You should've told me about this!

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:56.366
The lawsuit just seemed so ridiculous.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.369
I didn't want to worry you for no reason,
so I didn't tell you.

00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:03.165
What was he charged with?

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:06.251
Fraud.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.131
Fraud?

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:15.844
I'm sure it's a mistake.
He'll be out soon.

00:02:15.928 --> 00:02:19.056
There's no way your dad
would do that. I mean, fraud?

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.474
There's no way.

00:02:30.484 --> 00:02:31.485
LUNCH CREW

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:32.569
I WANT RICE
FRIED RICE?

00:02:32.653 --> 00:02:34.571
NOTHING GREASY, LIGHT AND CLEAN
SSAMBAP?

00:02:34.655 --> 00:02:35.989
SOUNDS GOOD
SEE YOU DOWNSTAIRS

00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:37.115
GOT IT
OKAY

00:02:44.623 --> 00:02:45.666
KANG HUIJI

00:02:56.844 --> 00:02:58.512
- Where are you?
- <i>I'll call you later.</i>

00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:12.359
Episode 8
A Stranger Who Feels Close

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.244
- Hello.
- How may I help you?

00:03:22.327 --> 00:03:24.162
I'm here to see someone in custody.

00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:26.164
As legal counsel or for a family visit?

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:30.961
A family visit.

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:37.593
Mr. Kim refused the visit.

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:40.470
What? He refused?

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.640
Does he know who came?

00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:46.018
He was willing to come
for a family visit.

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:48.270
But he refused
when we said it was his daughter.

00:04:05.287 --> 00:04:07.289
What? You're kidding, right?

00:04:07.915 --> 00:04:09.249
That's not true, right?

00:04:11.627 --> 00:04:14.087
No, I've trusted you this whole time.

00:04:15.005 --> 00:04:17.508
So please, just give me
my money back, okay?

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:22.262
What do you mean there's nothing?
You got it through Park!

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.351
No, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry.

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:30.062
Please, I'm begging you.

00:04:31.146 --> 00:04:32.189
I…

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:48.497
No, it's not that…

00:05:04.513 --> 00:05:05.597
Huiji.

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:10.394
Don't worry.

00:05:10.477 --> 00:05:12.896
No matter what it takes,
I'll get that money back.

00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:16.441
I'll make things right again.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.238
It couldn't be…

00:05:34.418 --> 00:05:35.794
Legal deadlines.

00:05:35.878 --> 00:05:39.631
As lawyers, we always
have to be careful with legal deadlines.

00:05:39.715 --> 00:05:41.967
Deadlines for appeals, objections…

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.011
Miss them by even a minute,

00:05:44.595 --> 00:05:46.555
and there's no going back.

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:49.266
Got it?

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.434
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:05:53.312 --> 00:05:54.730
Why are you…

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:56.148
You didn't submit your work.

00:05:56.231 --> 00:05:57.566
But I did.

00:05:57.649 --> 00:05:58.734
I emailed it to you.

00:05:58.817 --> 00:05:59.818
It was due yesterday,

00:05:59.902 --> 00:06:02.362
but you sent it
after midnight at 12:05 a.m.

00:06:04.198 --> 00:06:06.074
Right. I'm sorry.

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.036
- Excuse me, Ms. Kim?
- Yes?

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:12.414
Could I have a quick word with you?

00:06:12.998 --> 00:06:13.999
Sure.

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:16.335
- Take your time, everyone.
- Okay.

00:06:17.586 --> 00:06:18.587
Please come in.

00:06:26.428 --> 00:06:28.680
Please have a seat over here.

00:06:28.764 --> 00:06:30.182
No.

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:32.601
It's not something we need to
sit down and talk about.

00:06:34.937 --> 00:06:40.234
You keep calling Attorney Ha away,
so it's starting to become a distraction.

00:06:40.943 --> 00:06:42.528
I'd prefer if you stopped.

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:47.074
Tomorrow's the last day for that.

00:06:47.658 --> 00:06:51.203
But the thing is, while it's true
that I first asked him to help out,

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:54.164
it seems he's the one
who is enjoying it now.

00:06:54.248 --> 00:06:55.499
He's been helping often.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:07:00.045
It's good for the students,
and he seems to be having fun.

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:02.881
Could you let him finish it out? Please?

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:06.593
Did Attorney Ha say he enjoys it?

00:07:08.303 --> 00:07:09.930
Would you like to go and take a look?

00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:12.474
No, why would I do that?

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.477
Well, all right.

00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:17.938
Then, I'll get going.

00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:19.898
I was in the middle of class.

00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:30.033
A round of applause.

00:07:35.038 --> 00:07:37.583
All of you have failed
your assignments.

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.168
- What?
- What?

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.547
Come on. You said we'd win the case.

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:46.967
What kind of land
was involved in this case?

00:07:50.637 --> 00:07:52.014
It was farmland.

00:07:52.097 --> 00:07:54.391
What does the Constitution
say about farmland?

00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.686
"Farmland is for farmers."

00:07:57.769 --> 00:08:01.690
Only farmers can own farmland.

00:08:02.566 --> 00:08:04.818
Even if you did win this case,

00:08:04.902 --> 00:08:07.487
if your client isn't a farmer,
they can't reclaim this land.

00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:12.117
So, the point of this assignment
wasn't just to win in court.

00:08:12.618 --> 00:08:16.246
It was to also find a legal way
to take ownership of the land.

00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:21.168
If you think the work ends with a win,

00:08:21.752 --> 00:08:23.629
you'll never become a good lawyer.

00:08:25.172 --> 00:08:26.882
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:08:43.315 --> 00:08:45.192
<i>I hope we can be friends.</i>

00:09:04.461 --> 00:09:09.007
SEX CRIMES, DUI, CYBERCRIME, THEFT

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:11.718
Not here.

00:09:18.976 --> 00:09:20.477
NARCOTICS CONTROL ACT VIOLATION

00:09:20.561 --> 00:09:23.105
CHILD ABUSE

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:24.773
Damn it.

00:09:37.661 --> 00:09:39.621
I HOPE WE CAN BE FRIENDS

00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:46.253
Come in.

00:09:51.967 --> 00:09:55.804
Attorney Cho, the verdict came in for
the court-appointed voice phishing case.

00:09:55.888 --> 00:09:57.097
They found her guilty.

00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:00.893
- Do Mikyung's case?
- Yes.

00:10:00.976 --> 00:10:03.270
She was fined 10 million won.

00:10:07.566 --> 00:10:08.734
Okay. Thank you.

00:10:14.907 --> 00:10:16.992
Damn it. I don't believe this.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.343
Hello, Attorney Kang.

00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:35.844
Hello.

00:10:36.428 --> 00:10:38.847
I'm sorry for taking the morning off
last-minute today.

00:10:38.931 --> 00:10:40.265
No, it's totally fine.

00:10:40.974 --> 00:10:42.935
Did the thing you had to
take care of work out?

00:10:44.478 --> 00:10:46.396
Yes, it worked out well thanks to you.

00:10:47.022 --> 00:10:48.023
That's good.

00:11:11.255 --> 00:11:13.465
Attorney Kang,
were you expecting any complaints?

00:11:13.549 --> 00:11:15.050
A fax came in addressed to you.

00:11:15.634 --> 00:11:17.469
Right. Thank you.

00:11:32.776 --> 00:11:33.777
COMPLAINT

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:38.824
DEFENDANT
KIM MYEONGHO

00:11:38.907 --> 00:11:41.118
I don't know what cryptocurrency
you're talking about.

00:11:41.201 --> 00:11:42.995
I never received any money.

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:45.122
Didn't you make a deal with Choi Seongmi?

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:46.206
REASON FOR LAWSUIT

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:47.416
THE ACCUSER WAS MISLED

00:11:47.499 --> 00:11:48.709
AND LOST 350 MILLION WON

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:53.964
<i>No matter what it takes,
I'll get that money back.</i>

00:11:54.506 --> 00:11:56.049
I'll make things right again.

00:12:07.102 --> 00:12:09.521
You're back again.
Family visit hours are over though.

00:12:09.605 --> 00:12:10.981
I'm visiting as his attorney.

00:12:13.108 --> 00:12:15.194
Please tell him to come out. Please.

00:12:16.028 --> 00:12:17.029
Okay.

00:12:38.967 --> 00:12:41.929
Why did you come all the way here?
It's nothing serious.

00:12:42.513 --> 00:12:44.932
It's the exact same way
that you were scammed.

00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:51.438
How did you know that?

00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:54.858
You're not defending this, right?

00:12:57.778 --> 00:12:58.779
Huiji.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:01.740
You absolutely can't take this.
Listen to me.

00:13:04.159 --> 00:13:05.661
I came out here to tell you that.

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:07.871
It's not true, right?

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:11.583
You said no matter what it took,
you'd make things right.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.628
This isn't what you meant, right?

00:13:18.632 --> 00:13:20.342
I don't know anything about this.

00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:22.511
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

00:13:22.594 --> 00:13:24.513
It'll be cleared up soon. Don't worry.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.432
Dad.

00:13:29.393 --> 00:13:31.311
Don't come back anymore. Okay?

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:33.522
I'll see you when I get out.

00:13:49.538 --> 00:13:52.666
- Here. Deliver this to the client.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

00:13:53.458 --> 00:13:55.836
Aren't you close with the attorney
from the eighth floor?

00:13:56.837 --> 00:13:58.255
Yes, we are.

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:01.175
I see. It seems her family
has something going on.

00:14:01.258 --> 00:14:02.259
Her father…

00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:04.094
Was in jail.

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:05.888
What?

00:14:05.971 --> 00:14:07.598
I saw her at the police station.

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:09.516
What? He refused?

00:14:10.309 --> 00:14:11.727
Does he know who came?

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:13.520
He was willing to come
for a family visit.

00:14:13.604 --> 00:14:15.772
But he refused
when we said it was his daughter.

00:14:15.856 --> 00:14:17.941
<i>I wonder if he has
a long criminal record.</i>

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:20.777
She didn't seem to be
on good terms with her father.

00:14:23.447 --> 00:14:25.157
I don't know to that extent.

00:14:26.033 --> 00:14:27.451
Not that close? That's good.

00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:29.203
You should keep your distance.

00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:32.414
You can go.

00:14:38.921 --> 00:14:41.131
ATTORNEY APPOINTMENT FORM

00:14:43.175 --> 00:14:44.176
I'll do it, Mom.

00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:45.844
I'm going to get another lawyer.

00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:47.054
Don't worry about it.

00:14:47.137 --> 00:14:49.223
Why is it such a problem? I'm a lawyer.

00:14:49.306 --> 00:14:51.725
If you take this, your boss will find out.

00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:53.644
What are you going to tell her?

00:14:54.228 --> 00:14:57.397
That your dad got arrested for fraud
and you have to defend him?

00:14:57.981 --> 00:14:59.483
He didn't commit fraud.

00:15:01.777 --> 00:15:03.946
I'll tell my boss that too.
Then, it'll be fine.

00:15:04.029 --> 00:15:05.155
Still, you can't.

00:15:05.239 --> 00:15:07.074
Don't bring it up anymore.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.119
We don't want you

00:15:11.787 --> 00:15:13.997
to get hurt because of us,
not even a little.

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:18.085
Just like when we first took you in,

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:20.921
and even more so now.

00:15:26.134 --> 00:15:27.135
Mom.

00:15:46.822 --> 00:15:48.949
KANG HUIJI

00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:03.297
- Hello?
<i>- Where are you? I'm now…</i>

00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:11.972
There you are.

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.103
So…

00:16:18.187 --> 00:16:21.064
I need a favor from you.

00:16:24.443 --> 00:16:27.446
If you just make it look
like you're handling it,

00:16:27.529 --> 00:16:28.989
I'll take care of the actual work.

00:16:29.615 --> 00:16:32.534
Just take care of the visible aspects
like visitations and trials.

00:16:35.037 --> 00:16:36.079
And to your boss,

00:16:36.163 --> 00:16:38.957
just say it's for someone you know
through an acquaintance.

00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:40.167
Are you okay?

00:16:41.502 --> 00:16:42.503
What?

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.963
You're going through a lot.

00:16:47.883 --> 00:16:49.676
It was a little rough at first.

00:16:50.719 --> 00:16:52.262
But now, I'm fine.

00:16:55.307 --> 00:16:57.142
I'm sorry I'm asking you to do this.

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:03.941
I'll do it.

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:10.155
COMPLAINT

00:17:10.239 --> 00:17:11.740
PLAINTIFF
KIM SUCHEOL

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:14.743
DEFENDANT
KIM MYEONGHO

00:17:14.826 --> 00:17:16.745
"Kim Myeongho."

00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:29.758
PARTIES MET WHILE VOLUNTEERING
MONEY TAKEN FOR CRYPTO INVESTMENT

00:17:29.842 --> 00:17:30.884
SUING FOR FRAUD

00:17:37.307 --> 00:17:40.352
That's why I invest
with Mr. Kim Myeongho.

00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:42.104
He works in the trade business,

00:17:42.187 --> 00:17:44.606
- so he knows a lot about foreign crypto.
- How's the food?

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.192
- Mr. Kim does that kind of business too?
- Of course.

00:17:52.072 --> 00:17:55.117
Please sit. We were talking about
your crypto business.

00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:57.786
What exactly is it?

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:59.371
Well…

00:17:59.955 --> 00:18:02.833
I'm planning to buy
some promising foreign cryptocurrencies.

00:18:02.916 --> 00:18:04.126
I know them pretty well.

00:18:04.209 --> 00:18:06.920
If you invest with me,
I'll set up a crypto wallet for you

00:18:07.004 --> 00:18:08.755
and share the profits.

00:18:08.839 --> 00:18:10.007
And that's not all.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.884
If you bring in other investors,

00:18:11.967 --> 00:18:14.178
your payouts go up,
like multi-level marketing.

00:18:15.721 --> 00:18:18.891
So if you're going to do it,
you have to go through me, okay?

00:18:20.309 --> 00:18:22.644
Then, I'll get a bigger cut, right?

00:18:22.728 --> 00:18:24.563
Hey, don't count your chickens just yet.

00:18:25.898 --> 00:18:27.941
They don't seem interested in investing.

00:18:28.025 --> 00:18:30.944
Well, what kind of payouts
are we talking about?

00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:35.657
<i>I don't know what cryptocurrency
you're talking about.</i>

00:18:35.741 --> 00:18:38.118
<i>I never received any money.</i>

00:18:38.202 --> 00:18:39.995
Didn't you make a deal with Choi Seongmi?

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:42.206
What are you talking about?

00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:45.709
We clearly agreed to invest
through Ms. Choi that day,

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:48.670
and we have records that confirm
she transferred the money to you!

00:18:48.754 --> 00:18:52.883
So, do you have any kind
of investment contract that we signed?

00:18:52.966 --> 00:18:54.218
You don't.

00:19:12.611 --> 00:19:15.197
DEFENDANT
KIM MYEONGHO

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.811
What's up? Have you eaten?

00:19:47.062 --> 00:19:48.772
Well, sort of.

00:19:49.982 --> 00:19:52.776
It feels like
I haven't seen you in a while.

00:19:59.116 --> 00:20:00.409
Do you have a minute?

00:20:01.451 --> 00:20:04.872
So, is your father okay?

00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:08.959
What do you mean?

00:20:11.587 --> 00:20:13.547
I thought about pretending not to know,

00:20:14.923 --> 00:20:15.924
but I was worried.

00:20:16.925 --> 00:20:18.886
I heard he's being held in custody.

00:20:23.807 --> 00:20:25.100
I'm sorry.

00:20:25.184 --> 00:20:26.602
I found out by coincidence.

00:20:26.685 --> 00:20:29.897
My boss said he saw you
when he was at the police station.

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:33.901
Well…

00:20:35.319 --> 00:20:37.112
He's been framed.

00:20:37.196 --> 00:20:38.488
Framed?

00:20:38.572 --> 00:20:40.657
Yeah, I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:41.783
Wait.

00:20:41.867 --> 00:20:43.994
Who were the fools
that didn't investigate properly?

00:20:44.077 --> 00:20:45.454
The cops or prosecutors?

00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:51.001
Will you be okay on your own?

00:20:52.878 --> 00:20:54.963
Juhyeong agreed to help me.

00:20:59.468 --> 00:21:00.719
Juhyeong knows about it?

00:21:01.303 --> 00:21:03.180
Yeah, it just kind of happened.

00:21:05.057 --> 00:21:06.642
We couldn't reach you yesterday.

00:21:06.725 --> 00:21:09.520
Everyone else is really worried
about you too.

00:21:11.313 --> 00:21:13.190
Really? I had no idea.

00:21:13.273 --> 00:21:15.275
I'll get in touch with them myself.

00:21:15.359 --> 00:21:16.360
Okay.

00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:18.946
All right.

00:21:20.697 --> 00:21:22.699
ATTORNEY CHO CHANGWON

00:21:32.835 --> 00:21:33.836
Yes?

00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:35.546
Attorney Cho, Ms. Do is here.

00:21:35.629 --> 00:21:36.713
I see.

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:40.050
Hello, Attorney Cho.

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:41.134
Hello, ma'am.

00:21:41.218 --> 00:21:42.427
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

00:21:47.307 --> 00:21:51.228
They said I was guilty.
The fine is 10 million won.

00:21:52.521 --> 00:21:55.357
Yes, I also heard.

00:21:57.568 --> 00:21:58.569
I'm sorry.

00:21:59.152 --> 00:22:02.656
Not at all, Attorney Cho. It was my fault.

00:22:03.156 --> 00:22:04.992
Thank you for helping me.

00:22:06.827 --> 00:22:10.581
I haven't given you anything,
so I feel bad for coming again,

00:22:11.248 --> 00:22:16.253
but I didn't really understand
what happens if I can't pay the fine.

00:22:17.087 --> 00:22:19.464
I came back here
to ask you about that.

00:22:20.883 --> 00:22:21.884
I'm glad you came.

00:22:24.344 --> 00:22:25.888
PERFORM HARD LABOR IN DETENTION

00:22:25.971 --> 00:22:28.390
It means if you can't pay the fine,

00:22:29.308 --> 00:22:31.393
you'll be sent to prison.

00:22:32.227 --> 00:22:36.523
You'll work there, and each day counts
as 100,000 won off your fine.

00:22:38.817 --> 00:22:42.779
So I can work it off?

00:22:43.488 --> 00:22:44.740
That's a relief.

00:22:49.411 --> 00:22:51.330
When do I go in?

00:22:53.373 --> 00:22:54.374
It's not something

00:22:55.125 --> 00:22:56.793
you can just turn yourself in for.

00:23:02.299 --> 00:23:05.552
Don't worry about the fine. I'll cover it.

00:23:06.803 --> 00:23:09.181
- What?
- Don't worry about it. It's fine.

00:23:10.682 --> 00:23:14.061
No, I can't! What are you talking about?

00:23:14.144 --> 00:23:16.522
Goodness, I shouldn't have come.

00:23:16.605 --> 00:23:19.441
It's a loan, not a gift.
You can take your time and pay it back.

00:23:19.525 --> 00:23:21.068
No, I'm fine.

00:23:21.151 --> 00:23:22.778
- It's really okay.
- Attorney Cho.

00:23:24.196 --> 00:23:28.492
I did come here for your help
but not that kind of help.

00:23:29.493 --> 00:23:33.497
I may not be the smartest,
but I know what's right from wrong.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:38.210
Whether I steal or work the money off,
I'll come up with it on my own.

00:23:38.794 --> 00:23:42.214
Thank you
for all the help you've given me.

00:23:42.297 --> 00:23:43.298
Goodbye.

00:24:03.777 --> 00:24:05.988
- I'm heading out, Ms. Kim.
- Okay.

00:24:07.364 --> 00:24:08.949
Could you come in for a second?

00:24:09.449 --> 00:24:10.450
Yes?

00:24:13.203 --> 00:24:14.204
Yes, ma'am.

00:24:14.705 --> 00:24:17.666
There's a farewell party
for the interns tonight, right?

00:24:17.749 --> 00:24:21.044
- Use this.
- It's okay. Ms. Kim will handle it.

00:24:21.128 --> 00:24:23.630
Just say you're buying and use this.

00:24:25.382 --> 00:24:26.425
Thank you.

00:24:29.511 --> 00:24:31.847
You seem to really enjoy teaching.

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.600
Your eyes were totally lit up.

00:24:35.809 --> 00:24:36.810
What?

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:39.021
You were great.

00:24:41.273 --> 00:24:42.274
Well…

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.401
I see.

00:24:45.527 --> 00:24:47.362
- Go on.
- Okay.

00:24:49.114 --> 00:24:50.115
- Goodbye.
- All right.

00:24:53.869 --> 00:24:55.204
Should I close the door, or…

00:24:55.287 --> 00:24:57.331
It's okay. You can leave it.

00:24:57.414 --> 00:24:58.665
- All right, then.
- Thank you.

00:25:14.431 --> 00:25:15.432
Hi.

00:25:16.099 --> 00:25:17.100
Hello.

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.397
Did you have dinner?

00:25:22.481 --> 00:25:23.565
Not yet.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.152
Let's just sit for a bit,
and then head out.

00:25:30.489 --> 00:25:32.157
Did you read the complaint?

00:25:35.994 --> 00:25:37.746
You said it was your father's case?

00:25:40.707 --> 00:25:41.708
Yes.

00:25:44.795 --> 00:25:47.673
Even if I take this case as a formality,

00:25:47.756 --> 00:25:51.134
I'll learn more about you
than you might like.

00:25:52.177 --> 00:25:53.262
Are you sure

00:25:54.137 --> 00:25:55.514
you'd be okay with that?

00:25:58.517 --> 00:26:00.018
Of course, I don't mind.

00:26:03.105 --> 00:26:05.816
My parents died in an accident
when I was little.

00:26:06.441 --> 00:26:08.944
My aunt and uncle raised me.

00:26:09.736 --> 00:26:11.530
That's why my last name's different.

00:26:11.613 --> 00:26:14.032
I don't mind if you know these things.

00:26:16.702 --> 00:26:19.329
If you're okay with it, then I am too.

00:26:28.046 --> 00:26:29.798
Ever since I became a lawyer,

00:26:31.425 --> 00:26:34.136
I thought I'd always be ready
for situations like this.

00:26:36.388 --> 00:26:38.765
But nothing's going
the way I want.

00:26:38.849 --> 00:26:40.225
You don't have to go it alone.

00:26:41.310 --> 00:26:43.187
That's why you told me, isn't it?

00:26:59.578 --> 00:27:03.624
NOTICE OF POLICY CHANGE
FOR INMATE VISITATIONS

00:27:03.707 --> 00:27:06.919
SEOUL DETENTION CENTER

00:27:21.517 --> 00:27:24.436
Hello, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Ahn Juhyeong.

00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:26.271
Hello.

00:27:26.813 --> 00:27:29.024
I heard you're Huiji's colleague.

00:27:29.107 --> 00:27:30.108
Yes.

00:27:30.651 --> 00:27:33.612
Technically, we're not in the same firm,
so you can speak freely.

00:27:34.571 --> 00:27:36.448
I'm not worried about that.

00:27:37.115 --> 00:27:39.409
I'm fine as long as Huiji
doesn't take this case.

00:27:42.663 --> 00:27:45.332
First, I'd like to discuss
the charity event.

00:27:45.415 --> 00:27:48.210
Could you tell me
what happened with Ms. Choi?

00:27:50.045 --> 00:27:52.673
It was an unfamiliar setting for me,
so I felt uncomfortable.

00:27:52.756 --> 00:27:54.424
Ms. Choi wasn't next to me either.

00:28:15.571 --> 00:28:16.572
Hello.

00:28:20.033 --> 00:28:24.246
Mr. Kim had it all set up securely,
so I don't have any concerns.

00:28:24.955 --> 00:28:25.956
Right, Mr. Kim?

00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:27.541
Yes.

00:28:28.333 --> 00:28:31.587
Thanks to Ms. Choi,
our business has found some relief too.

00:28:32.421 --> 00:28:35.257
They are very interested
in foreign transactions as well.

00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.801
If I introduce them to you,
you have to take care of them.

00:28:37.885 --> 00:28:38.969
Yes, of course.

00:28:39.052 --> 00:28:42.723
Then, you'll adjust
my commission rate too, right?

00:28:44.224 --> 00:28:45.642
Yes, we can do that.

00:28:46.435 --> 00:28:49.146
Then first, you'll need to go through me.

00:28:55.944 --> 00:28:56.987
Gosh.

00:28:57.654 --> 00:28:59.364
Ms. Choi's great at what she does.

00:28:59.448 --> 00:29:01.241
You can trust and do business with her.

00:29:01.325 --> 00:29:03.994
I think chiming in then
is what caused the misunderstanding.

00:29:04.703 --> 00:29:06.997
So, what exactly am I being accused of?

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.374
You're being charged
with investment fraud.

00:29:09.458 --> 00:29:11.293
They're accusing you
of teaming with Ms. Choi

00:29:11.376 --> 00:29:14.171
to make them invest
in a fake cryptocurrency MLM scheme.

00:29:14.755 --> 00:29:16.965
But Ms. Choi claims
you were the mastermind,

00:29:17.049 --> 00:29:19.218
and she didn't really know
what was going on.

00:29:20.177 --> 00:29:21.178
I can't believe her.

00:29:21.261 --> 00:29:23.639
How long have you known Ms. Choi?

00:29:23.722 --> 00:29:25.516
Maybe about two years?

00:29:25.599 --> 00:29:27.476
I got to know her
through the business.

00:29:27.559 --> 00:29:30.479
Could you also explain
the 900 million-won transfer you received?

00:29:30.562 --> 00:29:34.107
She once urgently asked to borrow money.

00:29:34.691 --> 00:29:36.610
I used one of her properties
as collateral.

00:29:36.693 --> 00:29:39.112
I lent the money under the company's name
and got it back.

00:29:39.196 --> 00:29:41.114
- Did you write up a promissory note?
- Yes.

00:29:41.198 --> 00:29:42.407
Do you still have it?

00:29:42.991 --> 00:29:44.243
Not anymore.

00:29:44.326 --> 00:29:46.161
She paid it all back, so I returned it.

00:29:47.788 --> 00:29:49.790
What about the transfer details
of the loan?

00:29:50.916 --> 00:29:52.584
I lent it to her in cash.

00:29:53.627 --> 00:29:54.628
All 900 million won?

00:29:55.379 --> 00:29:56.380
Yes.

00:29:59.424 --> 00:30:00.425
I see.

00:30:09.142 --> 00:30:11.311
Sorry for making you all worry.

00:30:11.395 --> 00:30:13.063
Gosh, don't feel bad.

00:30:13.146 --> 00:30:15.607
Just focus on yourself.
Don't worry about us.

00:30:15.691 --> 00:30:17.943
Exactly. Hey, Changwon...

00:30:21.697 --> 00:30:23.740
What's this reaction?
Did you know about this?

00:30:25.242 --> 00:30:26.243
Well…

00:30:27.369 --> 00:30:29.788
I knew about it, but not from Huiji.

00:30:31.081 --> 00:30:32.457
I found out by coincidence.

00:30:32.541 --> 00:30:35.127
You should've at least
given us a heads-up if you knew.

00:30:35.210 --> 00:30:36.962
How could I bring up
something like that?

00:30:40.257 --> 00:30:42.009
Why didn't you say anything about this?

00:30:47.472 --> 00:30:48.473
How much do they know?

00:30:48.557 --> 00:30:50.184
I told them everything.

00:30:50.267 --> 00:30:51.476
Okay, then.

00:30:52.436 --> 00:30:54.146
So, anything we can do to help?

00:30:55.314 --> 00:30:57.858
Why would you ask that?
Of course, we should work together.

00:30:57.941 --> 00:30:59.776
That's why I'm asking.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.653
Exactly, we should help too.

00:31:10.329 --> 00:31:12.706
That's great. Let's do some work together.

00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:14.917
Yeah, collective intelligence.

00:31:15.876 --> 00:31:17.002
Let's do it!

00:31:19.713 --> 00:31:22.424
Kim Myeongho said
we've only known each other for two years?

00:31:22.508 --> 00:31:26.845
Yes. He claimed the only person
he knew there was you.

00:31:29.181 --> 00:31:30.307
Well, look.

00:31:30.390 --> 00:31:32.309
The weather was terrible that day.

00:31:32.392 --> 00:31:35.187
But Kim Myeongho insisted I come,

00:31:35.270 --> 00:31:37.022
because people with money would be there.

00:31:37.105 --> 00:31:38.398
What do you think that means?

00:31:39.399 --> 00:31:40.817
What does it mean?

00:31:42.861 --> 00:31:45.155
It means he wanted us to raise some cash.

00:31:45.822 --> 00:31:48.367
I think it was back in 2019.

00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:51.328
We had planned
a cryptocurrency venture together.

00:31:51.912 --> 00:31:53.497
He was going to restart it on his own.

00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:56.250
He said if I rounded up investors,
he'd give me a cut.

00:31:57.334 --> 00:32:00.212
If it was that type of setting,
he could've done it alone.

00:32:00.295 --> 00:32:04.091
He had no reason to make you come
if he had to pay you a cut.

00:32:06.343 --> 00:32:10.097
You don't land investors
by talking about it on your own.

00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:12.933
You need someone next to you
to hype things up.

00:32:13.016 --> 00:32:15.435
It's even better if a shill
says they've invested too.

00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:19.147
I did that favor for him,
and that's why I'm locked up now.

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.067
I shouldn't have said I put money in too.

00:32:23.735 --> 00:32:28.115
Even if that's true,
you still urged them to invest.

00:32:28.198 --> 00:32:31.451
That at least makes you
a fraud accomplice, doesn't it?

00:32:32.035 --> 00:32:37.040
Hey, I never even imagined
his crypto business was a complete lie.

00:32:37.124 --> 00:32:40.043
I even asked those people for a kickback.

00:32:40.127 --> 00:32:43.005
I told them to give me a cut
when he gave them their payouts.

00:32:43.088 --> 00:32:44.965
Only then would I connect them to him.

00:32:45.048 --> 00:32:49.136
So who do you think was telling the truth?
Kim Myeongho or me?

00:32:49.219 --> 00:32:52.306
I'm here to prove
Mr. Kim was telling the truth though.

00:33:20.459 --> 00:33:22.920
CEO KIM MYEONGHO

00:33:42.814 --> 00:33:44.816
LICENSED CUSTOMS BROKER CERTIFICATE

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:46.485
CERTIFICATE OF QUALIFICATION

00:33:51.031 --> 00:33:52.449
PRICE QUOTATIONS

00:33:52.533 --> 00:33:53.951
BANK TRANSACTION HISTORY

00:34:23.146 --> 00:34:25.566
Back from the visitation?
What did Choi Seongmi say?

00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:29.778
I told her your father said they had
only known each other for two years,

00:34:29.862 --> 00:34:31.280
and she couldn't believe it.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:35.701
She said they planned
a cryptocurrency venture together in 2019.

00:34:35.784 --> 00:34:37.870
Crypto? Wait. Here it is.

00:34:40.747 --> 00:34:45.169
It looks like your father did prepare
a cryptocurrency business back in 2019.

00:34:45.711 --> 00:34:49.298
Yeah, he did try to invest
in the cryptocurrency business back then.

00:34:49.381 --> 00:34:50.716
That's how he got scammed.

00:34:51.675 --> 00:34:52.718
If you look here,

00:34:53.594 --> 00:34:56.555
we also found a partnership contract
with Choi Seongmi from then.

00:34:57.264 --> 00:34:58.724
Did you check the stamps on it?

00:34:58.807 --> 00:35:00.350
Yeah, I checked.

00:35:00.434 --> 00:35:02.394
They match her father's company seal.

00:35:06.356 --> 00:35:08.233
The victims' statements

00:35:08.317 --> 00:35:10.152
all line up
with what Choi Seongmi said too.

00:35:12.571 --> 00:35:15.699
Huiji, just going by the evidence,

00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:20.829
her story seems a bit more plausible
than your father's.

00:35:20.913 --> 00:35:22.164
Timeline-wise,

00:35:22.247 --> 00:35:24.958
it seems like he was working
with Ms. Choi on a crypto business

00:35:25.042 --> 00:35:26.710
and then was scammed.

00:35:26.793 --> 00:35:27.836
The real issue is

00:35:28.462 --> 00:35:31.548
whether or not your father recently made

00:35:31.632 --> 00:35:34.092
the same proposal again to Choi Seongmi.

00:35:34.801 --> 00:35:36.428
Something like that, right?

00:35:41.391 --> 00:35:43.894
Wait, you think this contract is legit?

00:35:44.478 --> 00:35:46.021
We have to consider that possibility.

00:35:46.104 --> 00:35:48.815
Dad said he didn't even know
Choi Seongmi back then.

00:35:48.899 --> 00:35:51.151
So he must not know about this contract.

00:35:51.235 --> 00:35:52.528
The seal is a match,

00:35:52.611 --> 00:35:54.905
and the context of the contract
makes sense.

00:36:03.247 --> 00:36:04.581
If you look here,

00:36:04.665 --> 00:36:07.251
Ms. Choi's transactions
only started about two years ago.

00:36:09.086 --> 00:36:10.879
There's nothing in 2022.

00:36:11.463 --> 00:36:13.382
The first transaction was in 2023.

00:36:13.465 --> 00:36:15.676
Isn't it weird to start
a crypto business with someone

00:36:15.759 --> 00:36:17.344
you've never made deals with before?

00:36:17.427 --> 00:36:20.973
- No transactions exist afterwards either.
- This is just circumstantial evidence.

00:36:21.056 --> 00:36:22.766
We can still re-examine the context.

00:36:26.895 --> 00:36:30.357
There may come a point
where we have to plead guilty later.

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.277
You know how denying
each piece of objective evidence

00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:36.113
could affect the sentence.

00:36:36.196 --> 00:36:37.656
You have to think objectively.

00:36:40.033 --> 00:36:41.702
Okay, why don't we keep

00:36:41.785 --> 00:36:44.663
both possibilities open
and think about it?

00:36:45.455 --> 00:36:47.958
Yeah. Huiji has a point,
and so does Juhyeong.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.213
For now,

00:36:53.881 --> 00:36:56.550
we'll object to the contract
as evidence at trial.

00:36:56.633 --> 00:36:58.343
Once you agree, it sticks.

00:36:58.427 --> 00:37:01.388
I'll handle the evidence admission form,
so let's go with that.

00:37:03.098 --> 00:37:04.099
Okay.

00:37:22.659 --> 00:37:23.702
Hey.

00:37:27.206 --> 00:37:30.250
It's Huiji's father.
Aren't you being too impersonal?

00:37:31.835 --> 00:37:34.254
If that fact changes things,
that's a bigger problem.

00:37:34.338 --> 00:37:36.840
- Still…
- I'm not saying I've made up my mind.

00:37:37.633 --> 00:37:39.468
It's just what the evidence shows so far.

00:38:28.058 --> 00:38:30.394
- Hey.
- Sanggi.

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:34.815
You look really tired. Are you okay?

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.483
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:38:38.402 --> 00:38:40.445
You were working late last night too.

00:38:41.446 --> 00:38:44.074
Yeah. I was trying to finish
all of my backlog of work.

00:38:50.205 --> 00:38:51.707
Hello, Attorney Kang speaking.

00:38:54.126 --> 00:38:55.627
Is this Mr. Lee Sanghoon?

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.631
I'll get that draft to you
by the end of the day.

00:39:00.799 --> 00:39:02.176
Yes, I'm sorry.

00:39:03.218 --> 00:39:04.303
I forgot.

00:39:10.142 --> 00:39:12.144
DEFENDANT'S TABLE

00:39:13.395 --> 00:39:14.438
Should we try again?

00:39:16.648 --> 00:39:18.525
The victims reached out.

00:39:19.151 --> 00:39:20.152
To you directly?

00:39:20.235 --> 00:39:21.236
Yeah.

00:39:21.862 --> 00:39:24.406
They told me to hurry up
and pay the settlement

00:39:25.115 --> 00:39:26.867
if we want a lighter sentence for Dad.

00:39:49.223 --> 00:39:50.224
COURT

00:39:51.517 --> 00:39:55.395
All right, counsel for Mr. Kim,
share your position on the evidence.

00:40:00.984 --> 00:40:02.736
EVIDENCE ADMISSION FORM

00:40:07.241 --> 00:40:10.369
You're objecting to the statements
from Choi Seongmi, the victims…

00:40:11.328 --> 00:40:13.580
And to the contract as well?

00:40:15.666 --> 00:40:16.667
Yes, Your Honor.

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:18.502
All right, we'll note that.

00:40:18.585 --> 00:40:21.797
Prosecutor, please proceed
with the witness request accordingly.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:22.881
Yes, Your Honor.

00:40:22.965 --> 00:40:27.052
Then, the next hearing
will be held on March 18th, 2025

00:40:27.135 --> 00:40:28.595
for witness examination.

00:41:01.879 --> 00:41:05.799
We'll be calling Choi Seongmi to the stand
even though she's a co-defendant.

00:41:06.675 --> 00:41:08.886
The victims will testify next.

00:41:08.969 --> 00:41:11.471
I'd prefer it
if Huiji didn't come to the trial.

00:41:16.143 --> 00:41:19.229
May I ask why?

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:27.696
I'm just wondering if it relates
to the truth of the case.

00:41:27.779 --> 00:41:32.075
If Ms. Choi's story is correct,
please tell me now.

00:41:32.159 --> 00:41:34.661
That way, I can prepare the right defense.

00:41:34.745 --> 00:41:36.413
It's nothing like that.

00:41:39.291 --> 00:41:43.170
Then, why are you trying
to keep Huiji from coming?

00:41:46.173 --> 00:41:48.091
I didn't mean that.
Please I'm begging you.

00:41:49.051 --> 00:41:50.052
Please.

00:41:50.969 --> 00:41:52.054
Mr. Shin.

00:41:59.228 --> 00:42:02.231
Do you know what it feels like
to show a side of yourself

00:42:03.607 --> 00:42:05.359
you never wanted your daughter to see?

00:42:25.921 --> 00:42:28.090
Is my dad okay?

00:42:29.007 --> 00:42:30.759
He's very worried about you.

00:42:31.969 --> 00:42:34.179
He doesn't want you to come to the trial.

00:42:36.348 --> 00:42:37.432
I'm sure he doesn't.

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:40.269
He always only worries about me.

00:42:43.355 --> 00:42:44.815
It was upsetting to hear me

00:42:45.315 --> 00:42:46.316
be so blunt, wasn't it?

00:42:47.818 --> 00:42:48.819
Not at all.

00:42:49.695 --> 00:42:52.114
I know you only did that
for my dad's sake.

00:42:55.617 --> 00:42:58.704
I can't believe something like this
is happening again.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:05.669
It must've been so hard for him
back then on his own.

00:43:07.212 --> 00:43:10.257
People were scared they wouldn't get paid,
so they all hounded him.

00:43:11.133 --> 00:43:14.094
He couldn't take it
and shut the business down in the end.

00:43:16.346 --> 00:43:17.514
Even after that,

00:43:18.015 --> 00:43:20.809
the company itself remained registered.

00:43:20.893 --> 00:43:23.103
He really treasured that company.

00:43:24.188 --> 00:43:26.190
Maybe it's because
it was inspired by my name.

00:43:29.526 --> 00:43:31.486
So later on, when he started over,

00:43:32.154 --> 00:43:34.781
he just reused the same corporation.

00:43:37.159 --> 00:43:38.577
After becoming a lawyer,

00:43:39.119 --> 00:43:40.537
did you go back to that case?

00:43:42.915 --> 00:43:45.334
No, I didn't really want to look into it.

00:43:46.543 --> 00:43:49.630
I'd keep thinking
that if I knew then what I know now,

00:43:50.631 --> 00:43:52.424
maybe I could've stopped it.

00:43:53.467 --> 00:43:55.385
That thought would hurt too much.

00:44:03.268 --> 00:44:08.357
It seems your father
often did keep cash at the office.

00:44:09.816 --> 00:44:12.069
I went through a few years
of their bank records,

00:44:12.152 --> 00:44:14.780
and there were a lot
of periodic cash withdrawals.

00:44:14.863 --> 00:44:18.033
So the claim
that he lent money in cash checks out.

00:44:18.116 --> 00:44:19.826
It wasn't investment money he received.

00:44:20.494 --> 00:44:22.663
It was just a loan repayment.

00:44:27.751 --> 00:44:31.046
- Hello?
- <i>Damn it. Do you know what time it is now?</i>

00:44:31.588 --> 00:44:33.674
CLIENT LEE SANGHOON
WH EMBEZZLEMENT CASE

00:44:34.716 --> 00:44:36.009
Is this Mr. Lee?

00:44:36.093 --> 00:44:41.139
<i>You keep saying you'll send it by today.
Damn it, you've said that for days.</i>

00:44:41.223 --> 00:44:44.309
I'm sorry. By today... I mean,
I'll send it now as soon as it's ready.

00:44:44.393 --> 00:44:46.436
I'm so sorry. Okay, bye. I'm sorry.

00:44:48.355 --> 00:44:49.356
What's wrong?

00:44:49.439 --> 00:44:52.276
There's something urgent I need to do.
I'll head in first.

00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.987
- Huiji!
- You should eat first…

00:44:58.907 --> 00:45:01.076
I don't think she even took a bite.

00:45:13.422 --> 00:45:14.423
Yes?

00:45:15.257 --> 00:45:16.508
Are you really busy?

00:45:16.592 --> 00:45:18.051
Hey, Sanggi. What's up?

00:45:19.261 --> 00:45:20.971
Nothing much.

00:45:27.477 --> 00:45:28.604
An embezzlement case?

00:45:29.521 --> 00:45:31.899
- Yeah.
- I see. Scoot.

00:45:32.649 --> 00:45:33.692
What?

00:45:34.276 --> 00:45:36.195
Let's see.

00:45:37.738 --> 00:45:41.116
So I just sort the table
and submit it with the statement?

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.368
- Yeah, that's right.
- Scoot.

00:45:44.203 --> 00:45:45.621
Hurry up and scoot.

00:45:45.704 --> 00:45:47.289
What? Wait.

00:45:49.416 --> 00:45:50.417
I can do it myself.

00:45:50.501 --> 00:45:51.960
Just leave it to me.

00:45:53.253 --> 00:45:56.256
You should go and discuss
your father's case with them instead.

00:45:58.467 --> 00:45:59.468
Go on, now.

00:46:00.719 --> 00:46:01.887
Thanks, Sanggi.

00:46:15.734 --> 00:46:17.277
Let's go over each one.

00:46:17.778 --> 00:46:20.656
One if Choi Seongmi is right,
and one if Huiji's father is right.

00:46:20.739 --> 00:46:22.032
If Choi Seongmi is right,

00:46:22.115 --> 00:46:25.202
that means they tried to prepare
a similar business before.

00:46:25.285 --> 00:46:27.037
This time, Choi urged investment

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:30.249
and her father explained
the business structure to the victims.

00:46:30.749 --> 00:46:32.876
The old contract backs that up.

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.878
The victims' statements are evidence too.

00:46:34.962 --> 00:46:36.672
They're consistent with Choi's story.

00:46:37.756 --> 00:46:40.259
You're right.
Their testimonies are the issue.

00:46:40.843 --> 00:46:44.263
If Huiji's father is telling the truth,
what happens to the victims' stories?

00:46:44.346 --> 00:46:46.265
They're not really victims then.

00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:48.350
What?

00:46:48.433 --> 00:46:51.603
If Dad's telling the truth,
then those statements are false.

00:46:52.479 --> 00:46:54.898
The victims aren't just victims anymore.

00:47:08.495 --> 00:47:09.997
Let's meet them.

00:47:10.998 --> 00:47:12.332
- Now?
- Yeah.

00:47:17.171 --> 00:47:19.590
Where did you first meet Mr. Kim Myeongho?

00:47:19.673 --> 00:47:21.717
We met while doing volunteer work.

00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:25.053
So you both have businesses as well?

00:47:25.137 --> 00:47:28.140
No, we're just office workers.

00:47:31.101 --> 00:47:35.731
The volunteer group Mr. Kim chairs
is usually for businesspeople.

00:47:37.733 --> 00:47:42.196
The group he chairs was made recently.

00:47:42.279 --> 00:47:44.573
We met through
a different volunteer program.

00:47:45.157 --> 00:47:46.450
- All right?
- I see.

00:47:48.327 --> 00:47:50.037
He said it'd be really profitable

00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:52.289
and told us to send the money
through Ms. Choi.

00:47:52.873 --> 00:47:54.458
Ms. Choi used that as an excuse

00:47:55.751 --> 00:47:58.045
to make us give her kickbacks.

00:47:59.630 --> 00:48:02.341
Then, you could've transferred the money
directly to Mr. Kim.

00:48:02.424 --> 00:48:04.384
You barely knew Ms. Choi,

00:48:04.968 --> 00:48:07.888
but she asked for kickbacks,
and you just went along with that?

00:48:10.182 --> 00:48:11.475
What do you think you're doing?

00:48:12.351 --> 00:48:15.938
We came here today
thinking we'd discuss a settlement.

00:48:19.233 --> 00:48:22.611
If her father's telling the truth,

00:48:22.694 --> 00:48:24.196
then what on earth

00:48:24.988 --> 00:48:26.156
was that 2019 contract?

00:48:27.950 --> 00:48:31.328
It must've been so hard for him
back then on his own.

00:48:31.411 --> 00:48:33.830
He couldn't take it
and shut the business down in the end.

00:48:34.915 --> 00:48:38.377
According to Huiji, he was scammed
and had to close his business.

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:41.213
Then, four or five years ago,
he started over.

00:48:41.296 --> 00:48:45.217
When he shut down,
what contract would he have signed then?

00:48:45.801 --> 00:48:47.970
How long have you known Ms. Choi?

00:48:48.053 --> 00:48:49.805
Maybe about two years?

00:48:49.888 --> 00:48:54.101
Just as her father said,
if he had just recently met Choi,

00:48:55.227 --> 00:48:57.563
would she know
his business failed once before?

00:48:58.564 --> 00:49:02.025
Right. If she met him recently,
she wouldn't know about that.

00:49:04.236 --> 00:49:06.071
Choi Seongmi is lying.

00:49:07.447 --> 00:49:10.117
But why would the victims lie too?

00:49:10.784 --> 00:49:12.244
That's what I don't get.

00:49:16.039 --> 00:49:18.375
Who told you we were lying?

00:49:18.458 --> 00:49:21.920
Did she say you'd get your money back
if you painted Kim Myeongho as a fraud?

00:49:22.004 --> 00:49:24.715
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:49:24.798 --> 00:49:26.633
Even if you get your money back that way,

00:49:26.717 --> 00:49:28.886
that won't ease your conscience.

00:49:28.969 --> 00:49:31.388
You would become the frauds,
not the victim.

00:49:34.224 --> 00:49:37.269
How I feel doesn't matter at all.

00:49:38.812 --> 00:49:40.272
Right now, money is what matters.

00:49:42.774 --> 00:49:43.775
Let's go.

00:49:46.945 --> 00:49:48.071
Please.

00:49:48.155 --> 00:49:49.740
Tell us the truth.

00:49:52.492 --> 00:49:53.535
I'm sorry.

00:50:09.801 --> 00:50:10.802
Are you okay?

00:50:11.762 --> 00:50:12.763
Yeah.

00:50:14.681 --> 00:50:15.766
What's wrong?

00:50:18.018 --> 00:50:19.019
It's just…

00:50:19.561 --> 00:50:21.563
It reminded me of how my family was.

00:50:22.773 --> 00:50:28.445
I've seen up close how the swindled
suffer more than the swindler.

00:50:30.155 --> 00:50:33.909
Not to mention the grief
from losing your life savings all at once.

00:50:35.953 --> 00:50:37.162
At that point,

00:50:37.996 --> 00:50:43.418
you'd rather just get your money back
than see the scammer get punished.

00:50:44.795 --> 00:50:46.004
Gosh.

00:50:46.547 --> 00:50:48.382
You've worked so hard, Huiji.

00:50:51.093 --> 00:50:54.388
Everyone's probably waiting.
Want to buy some late-night snacks?

00:50:55.639 --> 00:50:57.975
- Sure.
- Sure. It's on me.

00:50:58.559 --> 00:50:59.560
What do you want?

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.562
What do you want, Munjeong?

00:51:02.145 --> 00:51:04.273
Hey, look at what I underlined.

00:51:05.315 --> 00:51:06.316
Over here.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:08.527
- Hey, Changwon.
- Yeah?

00:51:08.610 --> 00:51:10.070
Look at the one from two years ago.

00:51:10.153 --> 00:51:11.154
- Hold on.
- Okay.

00:51:11.238 --> 00:51:12.239
Juhyeong, look.

00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:14.491
Look at this ruling…

00:51:16.159 --> 00:51:17.911
They're hard to piece together.

00:51:19.621 --> 00:51:22.457
Yeah, the data from then might help us.

00:51:24.626 --> 00:51:27.462
Make sure you check these.

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:29.798
- Let's go in.
- Okay.

00:51:29.882 --> 00:51:32.009
- Eat this first.
- Hey, you're back.

00:51:41.476 --> 00:51:43.562
Attorney Cho.

00:51:44.563 --> 00:51:45.564
What is it?

00:51:45.647 --> 00:51:47.065
Do I just mark it like this?

00:51:47.983 --> 00:51:49.776
This one and this one…

00:51:50.527 --> 00:51:52.321
They're the same.

00:51:52.404 --> 00:51:53.697
These are right.

00:52:12.090 --> 00:52:13.217
No further questions.

00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:14.343
WITNESS STAND

00:52:14.426 --> 00:52:17.513
Okay. Counsel for Mr. Kim, please proceed
with your cross-examination.

00:52:17.596 --> 00:52:18.597
Yes, Your Honor.

00:52:22.935 --> 00:52:25.062
You agreed to launch a crypto business

00:52:25.145 --> 00:52:26.438
with the defendant in 2019.

00:52:26.522 --> 00:52:30.984
And this time, he asked you
to start it up again. Is that correct?

00:52:31.735 --> 00:52:32.945
Yes, that's correct.

00:52:38.116 --> 00:52:40.536
On the left is the contract
you said you two signed then.

00:52:40.619 --> 00:52:43.413
On the right is a recent tax invoice
from Mr. Kim's company.

00:52:43.497 --> 00:52:44.957
Same registration numbers, right?

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.042
Yes, I'm sure they are.

00:52:47.125 --> 00:52:49.503
Are you aware

00:52:49.586 --> 00:52:52.339
Mr. Kim's company shut down
around July 2019?

00:52:54.883 --> 00:52:56.260
Shut down?

00:53:01.515 --> 00:53:05.686
This is a tax invoice
dated January 11th, 2019.

00:53:05.769 --> 00:53:08.146
That number was voided
when the company closed.

00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:11.149
From October 2020 onwards,
a new number was used.

00:53:11.233 --> 00:53:13.777
But how is it that a contract
supposedly written in 2019

00:53:13.861 --> 00:53:16.822
contain a number
that didn't exist until 2020?

00:53:27.291 --> 00:53:30.544
You also borrowed 900 million won
from Mr. Kim's company, correct?

00:53:31.128 --> 00:53:34.006
You needed to repay that money
to regain the collateral you put up.

00:53:34.089 --> 00:53:35.340
But you didn't have the money,

00:53:35.424 --> 00:53:38.802
so you scammed 900 million won
from victims as investment, correct?

00:53:40.179 --> 00:53:43.223
- That's not true.
- You received a promissory note

00:53:43.307 --> 00:53:45.475
from Mr. Kim after repaying him,
didn't you?

00:53:46.476 --> 00:53:48.729
Didn't you copy the seal
from that promissory note

00:53:48.812 --> 00:53:50.480
to forge this contract?

00:53:50.564 --> 00:53:53.108
Wasn't it intended to frame Mr. Kim?

00:53:53.192 --> 00:53:54.443
That's not true!

00:53:59.072 --> 00:54:02.951
At this point, we question how credible
Ms. Choi's testimony is.

00:54:03.035 --> 00:54:04.036
No further questions.

00:54:16.548 --> 00:54:18.884
You told the police
during their investigation

00:54:18.967 --> 00:54:20.928
that Mr. Kim asked you to invest

00:54:21.011 --> 00:54:22.638
in his crypto business, correct?

00:54:22.721 --> 00:54:23.847
Yes.

00:54:24.973 --> 00:54:25.974
And just now,

00:54:26.767 --> 00:54:29.645
you saw how Ms. Choi
was caught lying, didn't you?

00:54:31.146 --> 00:54:33.440
Is what you told the police true?

00:54:36.193 --> 00:54:39.321
The credibility of Ms. Choi's testimony
has been completely dismantled.

00:54:39.404 --> 00:54:40.489
Think carefully.

00:54:40.572 --> 00:54:42.324
Don't add perjury on top of this.

00:54:52.501 --> 00:54:53.877
I'll ask you one more time.

00:54:54.628 --> 00:54:55.879
Is it true?

00:55:01.426 --> 00:55:02.594
Ma'am!

00:55:02.678 --> 00:55:04.096
Why did you lie?

00:55:04.972 --> 00:55:07.641
- Counsel.
- Because that way, I'd get my money back!

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:17.442
She said if I went along,
I'd get my money back first.

00:55:18.527 --> 00:55:21.321
So you framed Mr. Kim,

00:55:21.947 --> 00:55:23.782
knowing Ms. Choi was the real culprit?

00:55:23.866 --> 00:55:25.075
I didn't know at first.

00:55:25.158 --> 00:55:28.036
At first, I really thought
I was investing with Mr. Kim.

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:29.329
But thinking back,

00:55:29.413 --> 00:55:33.166
Mr. Kim never even mentioned
cryptocurrencies.

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:36.378
All he did was just back up
what Ms. Choi said.

00:55:36.461 --> 00:55:38.255
So when you confronted Ms. Choi,

00:55:38.338 --> 00:55:40.257
did she suggest framing Mr. Kim?

00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:42.384
I asked what happened,

00:55:42.467 --> 00:55:44.052
and she said she had no money to give.

00:55:44.970 --> 00:55:48.182
She said if she went to jail,
we wouldn't get it back.

00:55:48.265 --> 00:55:50.767
Our only chance was to go along with her.

00:55:52.019 --> 00:55:56.106
I didn't know it would go this far either.

00:55:56.815 --> 00:55:57.816
I'm sorry.

00:56:39.066 --> 00:56:43.195
LAW GROUP HYUNGMIN

00:56:55.832 --> 00:56:57.292
Stop it, you two.

00:56:58.919 --> 00:56:59.920
Hi.

00:57:01.463 --> 00:57:02.923
- What's going on?
- Get in.

00:57:03.006 --> 00:57:05.425
- Today was the end of your troubles.
- Hurry and get in.

00:57:06.301 --> 00:57:09.805
Hey, the wrong lawyer came in earlier.
And it was super awkward.

00:57:09.888 --> 00:57:11.723
We've gone up and down
a few times already.

00:57:11.807 --> 00:57:14.101
- We were holding the elevator.
- Really?

00:57:15.394 --> 00:57:17.020
We'll begin with the sentencing.

00:57:17.104 --> 00:57:22.860
Criminal case number 2025-194.

00:57:23.569 --> 00:57:26.822
Defendants Kim Myeongho and Choi Seongmi.

00:57:27.322 --> 00:57:28.323
The verdict.

00:57:28.407 --> 00:57:32.286
Defendant Choi Seongmi
is sentenced to seven years in prison.

00:57:33.328 --> 00:57:36.456
Defendant Kim Myeongho
is found not guilty.

00:58:16.830 --> 00:58:17.831
Eat up.

00:58:18.999 --> 00:58:20.501
You've been through so much.

00:58:22.419 --> 00:58:24.087
Huiji's the one who went through a lot.

00:58:24.588 --> 00:58:26.507
I'm sorry. I messed up again.

00:58:30.594 --> 00:58:31.637
Dad.

00:58:34.389 --> 00:58:37.351
You've always been a good dad.

00:58:43.857 --> 00:58:45.817
Stop trying so hard.
You can lean on me now.

00:58:49.738 --> 00:58:51.490
Eat up.

00:58:52.824 --> 00:58:53.825
Okay?

00:59:28.318 --> 00:59:29.611
<i>It's on me today!</i>

00:59:30.779 --> 00:59:32.614
- What are these?
- This one's on me.

00:59:32.698 --> 00:59:34.741
- So eat up, everyone!
- I chose the dishes.

00:59:34.825 --> 00:59:37.828
- No, my baby did.
- Geez.

00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:41.456
Thank you all so much.
I couldn't have done it alone.

00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:43.750
Well, you're the one who did a good job.

00:59:43.834 --> 00:59:45.586
In any case, this is nice to see.

00:59:46.879 --> 00:59:47.880
What?

00:59:48.463 --> 00:59:50.007
- Your bowl.
- Sure.

00:59:53.969 --> 00:59:55.345
Thank you.

01:00:09.443 --> 01:00:10.652
Thanks.

01:00:12.362 --> 01:00:13.447
Damn it.

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:15.282
How long do we have to play dumb for?

01:00:15.991 --> 01:00:18.994
Right? We're lawyers. We catch on quick.

01:00:19.077 --> 01:00:21.830
Exactly. So, should we wait
a bit longer or what?

01:00:29.463 --> 01:00:30.464
Well…

01:00:34.426 --> 01:00:36.637
If you all know,
then there's no need to say.

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.557
Instead of food pictures today,

01:00:41.517 --> 01:00:43.227
I better take some photos of you two.

01:00:44.102 --> 01:00:45.729
Can you get closer?

01:00:45.812 --> 01:00:49.399
- Get closer.
- Just for a second. Just like that.

01:00:49.483 --> 01:00:51.318
Okay, two, three…

01:00:51.401 --> 01:00:52.402
Okay.

01:00:52.486 --> 01:00:54.947
Now that you're close,
you two look good together.

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:14.633
- What is it?
- Ta-da!

01:01:14.716 --> 01:01:15.801
- What's this?
- Fruits.

01:01:16.677 --> 01:01:18.136
You wanted some this morning.

01:01:20.055 --> 01:01:22.224
I sliced up a bunch just in case.

01:01:22.307 --> 01:01:24.309
Take some out
and eat them when you want.

01:01:27.312 --> 01:01:29.439
- Thanks.
- I'm off.

01:01:32.693 --> 01:01:34.695
Did they say
when your maternity leave starts?

01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:37.072
- Maternity leave?
- Yeah.

01:01:37.155 --> 01:01:38.782
I have to think about that already?

01:01:38.866 --> 01:01:41.910
No, it just came up
while I was talking to the staff today.

01:01:41.994 --> 01:01:44.997
With our schedule, it's better
to plan and coordinate in advance.

01:01:45.998 --> 01:01:47.249
I haven't thought about it.

01:01:48.709 --> 01:01:51.044
That's okay. Take your time to think.

01:01:51.128 --> 01:01:52.754
- While you eat your fruit.
- Okay.

01:01:52.838 --> 01:01:54.423
- Okay, I'm going.
- See you.

01:01:58.468 --> 01:01:59.553
Press the first floor.

01:01:59.636 --> 01:02:01.221
Right. Bye!

01:02:31.668 --> 01:02:32.753
Maternity leave?

01:02:43.805 --> 01:02:44.806
Yes, come in.

01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:49.853
What is it?

01:02:49.937 --> 01:02:54.274
Sir, how do I apply
for maternity or parental leave?

01:02:55.526 --> 01:02:58.362
I don't know.
I don't think there's ever been one.

01:02:59.321 --> 01:03:00.572
Not even once?

01:03:00.656 --> 01:03:02.991
Yes, people usually just quit.
Why do you ask?

01:03:03.575 --> 01:03:04.576
Are you pregnant?

01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:07.746
Yes. I mean, it's only been a few weeks.

01:03:09.498 --> 01:03:12.709
We still have a little bit of time.
Let's talk about it then, shall we?

01:03:16.213 --> 01:03:18.048
But it's guaranteed by law.

01:03:18.131 --> 01:03:20.342
Do we really have to
discuss it again later?

01:03:23.095 --> 01:03:24.805
Come on, you know the drill.

01:03:26.139 --> 01:03:28.058
How many cases are you handling right now?

01:03:29.351 --> 01:03:30.686
About 50.

01:03:30.769 --> 01:03:31.812
So what do we do?

01:03:31.895 --> 01:03:35.524
Do Attorney Ahn and I each take 25?
We already have 50 each.

01:03:35.607 --> 01:03:38.485
Hiring a temp lawyer
for three or six months isn't easy.

01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:40.279
Plus, I'm not eager to do that.

01:03:41.864 --> 01:03:44.908
You know clients hate it
when their attorneys keep changing.

01:03:44.992 --> 01:03:46.577
That is true.

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:47.995
But it's still my right.

01:03:48.078 --> 01:03:49.788
Yes, I know it is.

01:03:52.875 --> 01:03:54.751
All right,
I'll give it some serious thought.

01:03:54.835 --> 01:03:56.795
We have some time. Let's talk later.

01:03:58.589 --> 01:03:59.756
Hello, this is Na Kyungmin.

01:04:01.967 --> 01:04:02.968
Yes.

01:04:04.303 --> 01:04:05.804
I sent that to you yesterday.

01:04:06.763 --> 01:04:08.015
Yes, I sent you an email.

01:04:12.853 --> 01:04:16.732
Yes, I get it,
but if you say it like that…

01:04:17.399 --> 01:04:18.400
Yes.

01:04:19.484 --> 01:04:20.819
I'm sorry.

01:04:20.903 --> 01:04:24.031
Yes, I think it's best to come in
and coordinate in person.

01:04:24.114 --> 01:04:26.158
Yes, I understand.

01:04:27.034 --> 01:04:28.076
All right, then.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.411
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.

01:04:31.788 --> 01:04:33.665
Hello, this is Law Group Hyungmin.

01:04:33.749 --> 01:04:37.211
He's not here right now. Yes, I'm sorry.

01:04:37.294 --> 01:04:39.254
When dealing with municipal vendors,

01:04:39.338 --> 01:04:42.466
the defendant is usually the one
responsible for payment.

01:05:15.791 --> 01:05:18.377
Law and The City

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:20.170
Hello, this is Law Group Hyungmin.

01:05:48.490 --> 01:05:52.202
Law and The City

01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:56.373
- I'm being considerate of your pregnancy.
- No, I'll do it.

01:05:56.456 --> 01:05:59.251
Your mom wasn't feeling well,
so I swapped shifts with her.

01:05:59.334 --> 01:06:01.920
If it's serious, get it treated.
What are you talking about?

01:06:02.004 --> 01:06:04.882
Is having your own office
at the firm making you a little confused?

01:06:08.177 --> 01:06:11.263
If things are hard, say it.
Don't just say you're fine.

01:06:11.346 --> 01:06:13.182
He even followed him to his new school.

01:06:13.765 --> 01:06:16.226
The bullying and attack was ongoing?

01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:18.145
<i>Where did you get the knife?</i>

01:06:19.521 --> 01:06:20.981
Why haven't I been arrested?

01:06:31.325 --> 01:06:33.327
