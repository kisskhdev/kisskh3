WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:45.451

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:56.920
Help!

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:00.320
The puppet is killing, help!

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.480
It is all Miss Meigui's fault.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.560
Just watch how I deal with you.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.719
Sun Laoban is not the killer.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.879
Why?

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.400
This motive for murder does not hold up.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.079
We originally thought once Wu Laoban died,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.400
Sun Laoban would become the biggest beneficiary.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But this song and dance hall is losing money.

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:54.879
They were just waiting for the puppet show to open

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.040
so they could make a big profit.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.400
At that moment,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.920
if Sun Laoban killed Wu Laoban,

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:00.439
would that not be a losing bargain?

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.560
What do you think?

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:04.359
The timing of the murder does not fit.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.000
The killer committed a locked room murder.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.319
He controlled the puppet

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:09.800
and hid in the crowd after the killing.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.280
But that day Sun Laoban

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.039
was the last one to arrive.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.439
He has an alibi.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.560
Then who is the killer?

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.080
If we analyze by motive for murder,

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.719
Miss Meigui

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.159
is actually very suspicious.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.319
Think about it.

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:30.280
Once Wu Laoban dies,

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:31.840
no one will be promoting Wen Qing.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:33.199
Then the Star Dancer spot

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.960
will naturally go to Miss Meigui.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.039
Then I will go investigate Miss Meigui.

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:38.759
No need.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.719
Darn it, I will go.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.080
You go look for other evidence.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.039
No, I...

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.199
Why will you not let me go?

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.840
Look, we

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.159
can follow Miss Su's plan first.

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:51.960
Let us all listen to her for now.

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:53.879
Move out immediately.

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:00.319
I am begging you.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.719
I will never talk back again.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.840
Wen Qing's arm is so badly hurt.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.280
Do you know how much I am losing?

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.120
Can you even afford to pay for it?

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.960
I was wrong.

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.719
I really know I was wrong.

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.199
I have all sorts of ways to deal with you.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.080
From now on, I will sing whenever you tell me to.

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.639
I will sing whatever you tell me to sing.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.120
I was waiting for you to say that.

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:33.159
Work hard for me from now on.

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:35.800
I will not treat you badly.

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:08.000
You came to laugh at me, did you not?

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.520
I never laugh at anyone

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.240
who has to bow to life.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.039
Wipe it off.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.279
Get up first.

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:33.360
You are a cop, right?

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:35.560
No.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.759
I am a forensic doctor.

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:41.160
I told Sun Laoban that there was something off about you.

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:42.600
I made him drive you away.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.519
How did you figure it out?

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.639
The song and dance hall is a real mixed crowd.

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:50.879
All sorts of people from all walks of life.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.279
You smell too proper,

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:54.959
and that actually gave you away.

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.720
Ask whatever you want.

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:58.839
I have nothing to hide anyway.

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.759
There was a murder in the song and dance hall.

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:04.000
Why did you not leave?

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.800
To earn money for my father’s medical bills.

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:10.319
The dance hall pays quickly,

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.959
so I became a dance girl.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.399
Sadly, my father still was not cured.

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:16.480
He passed away.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.040
I have also been in this dance hall for over ten years.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.079
I am used to it.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.959
If I leave here,

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.800
I do not even know where I could go.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.680
Are you the killer?

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:29.160
No.

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:30.759
I heard

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:33.040
Sun Laoban is really good at taking photos.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.399
If there is a chance,

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.800
take a few pictures for me.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.480
My skills are nothing but petty tricks.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.519
If you like,

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:40.879
I will take some for you then.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.600
We are here.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.639
Please come in.

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:45.519
Come on, come on.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.800
Please, please, please.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.120
Just treat Boss Zhou like you would Wu Laoban

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.959
After your arm has healed

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:03.360
Miss Wen

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:05.720
As long as you behave

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.600
You can get anything you want

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:32.319
Baby

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.199
Wu Laoban, Wu Laoban is here

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.959
Is that you

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.480
I have no grudge against you

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:38.800
Please, do not come after me

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:40.079
Wu Laoban, I am begging you

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.399
I beg you, I beg you

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.439
I do not want your wages

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.040
Wu Laoban, I do not want your wages

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.720
I will give up my wages, Wu Laoban

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.639
I really do not want the wages

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.160
No

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:50.959
No more, no more, no more

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:52.560
I really do not want it

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:56.399
How is it you

00:06:56.839 --> 00:06:57.879
Do you realize

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.360
You scared me half to death

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.839
You are here pretending to be a ghost

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.120
I was not pretending to be a ghost

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.519
That scary sound

00:07:03.959 --> 00:07:06.120
came from the phonograph

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:08.480
Besides, the one faking ghosts is not me

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.279
It is under that stage

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:12.360
The person who set up this phonograph

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:13.920
Do not be scared

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.959
Important clue, let me say it first

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:22.079
Look

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:24.160
Someone actually put one under the stage

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:25.360
They placed a phonograph there

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:27.319
to play the sound of screams

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:29.079
That must be Sun Laoban

00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:31.040
To make the puppet show go smoothly

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:33.079
he bribed the master to put on an act

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:35.480
This clue you mentioned is very helpful

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.160
But

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:38.959
the police station is calling us back now

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.399
They say the case is closed

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.360
The killer is not even found, how can it be closed

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.199
The killer turned himself in

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.839
It is Wen Qing's old flame

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:46.800
Liu Dazhu

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.800
I am the one who killed Wu Laoban

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:55.680
Liu Dazhu, I am telling you

00:07:56.079 --> 00:07:57.720
This is called intentional homicide

00:07:57.879 --> 00:07:59.120
You will be sentenced to death for it

00:07:59.279 --> 00:08:00.040
I know

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.360
Then why did you kill him

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.160
Wen Qing and I

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:07.800
were childhood sweethearts

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.879
We were in love with each other

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:12.639
Wen Qing loved to sing and dance

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:15.399
I came with her to try our luck in the big city

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:18.040
We found work at Wucheng Song and Dance Hall

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:19.839
Wen Qing

00:08:20.319 --> 00:08:22.199
soon became the hall's Star Dancer

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.639
Wu Laoban took a fancy to Wen Qing

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.279
He picked a fight and had me kicked out

00:08:28.319 --> 00:08:29.800
I went back to see Wen Qing several times

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:30.879
but I was stopped every time

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.759
No matter what job I tried to get

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.840
Wu Laoban would secretly ruin it

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.799
I ended up begging on the streets

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:42.279
Hurry up and get out of here

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.480
Wen Qing gave me money several times

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.200
She wanted me to leave Wucheng

00:08:53.879 --> 00:08:54.879
And go back to the countryside

00:08:55.879 --> 00:08:56.759
But I flat-out refused

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.440
Wu Laoban stole Wen Qing from me

00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:00.720
He drove me into a desperate corner

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:01.759
I hate him

00:09:02.159 --> 00:09:03.039
So I waited for the right chance

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.519
And killed him in one go

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.639
How did you kill him

00:09:11.639 --> 00:09:13.600
And how did you get out of the sealed

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:14.480
Changing room and escape

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.320
First I killed him

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:20.840
Then I set up the puppet properly

00:09:21.799 --> 00:09:23.159
To make it look like the puppet killed him

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.240
And scared them all away

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.720
After that I used the cover of night

00:09:27.879 --> 00:09:29.000
Threw away the black clothes

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.559
And slipped out disguised as a waiter

00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:33.120
Without the gods knowing

00:09:33.919 --> 00:09:34.879
Or the ghosts noticing

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.919
Since this whole matter

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:39.159
Has already been cleared up

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:41.480
I say we can close this case

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.879
Congratulations, you have kept your job

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.320
He is not the killer

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.759
His leg is injured

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.799
So he could not pose as a waiter

00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:53.000
And slip away in the chaos

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.960
Even less act while disguised as a puppet

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.679
This case is closed when I say it is

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.159
Stop investigating it

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.840
Stop creating trouble for the station

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:04.360
Take him away

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:09.360
You picked a good room

00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:11.519
Very well hidden

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:16.320
Boss Zhou

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:18.799
We agreed on this

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.039
From now on

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.320
We will be relying on you

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:24.559
Of course

00:10:25.519 --> 00:10:26.879
I will agree to anything

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.519
As long as you

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:30.240
Do as you are told

00:10:33.639 --> 00:10:34.799
It hurts

00:10:37.399 --> 00:10:39.000
When your injury is healed

00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:46.279
Wu Laoban

00:10:48.279 --> 00:10:49.240
Wu Laoban

00:11:09.559 --> 00:11:10.639
Didn not he say no puppets were allowed

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:11.480
In the changing room

00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:12.559
Why is there still one here

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:14.279
Such bad luck

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:19.440
Why

00:11:19.919 --> 00:11:20.840
Why

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:22.039
The song and dance hall case was closed

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.080
So why are puppet murders still happening

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:25.840
Chief

00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:26.799
It is possible

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.120
Maybe this is a new case

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.039
The killer

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:31.799
Wants to frame the hall puppets

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.080
Closing the case before it is clear

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.879
Will make the public think

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.039
We are a bunch of useless gluttons

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:44.759
Yang Zong

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.440
I am assigning you to keep investigating

00:11:46.919 --> 00:11:48.000
You must wrap it up quickly

00:11:48.639 --> 00:11:49.080
All right

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:49.919
No

00:11:50.799 --> 00:11:51.879
What is your objection

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.240
You stop or resume the case as you like

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.759
You really do not take us seriously

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.320
If you want us to investigate

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:59.039
You must meet my three conditions

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.000
Let us hear them

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:02.679
First

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.000
Zhao Wei

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.279
Is not allowed to meddle in this case

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.519
Second

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.399
Yang Zong was demoted before

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.639
Now he must be reinstated

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.759
Third

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.879
Once this case is solved

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:13.879
The bonus

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.039
Must be tripled

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.279
Those three conditions

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.679
I accept them all

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.360
Restoring the stations reputation

00:12:21.559 --> 00:12:22.480
Is our top priority

00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.600
Solve it quickly, do not fail

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.159
Thank you, Chief

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:31.919
Thank you, Chief

00:12:36.159 --> 00:12:36.840
Yang Zong

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:42.559
You must protect Su Qingyun for me

00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:44.879
Yes sir

00:12:52.039 --> 00:12:53.279
We have not solved the case yet

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.519
This money really burns in my hands

00:12:57.759 --> 00:12:58.600
All right, Old Li

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.080
You are actually paying me back

00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:02.159
No need

00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:04.120
I just negotiated it, we are back on the case

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.840
If we solve it, the bonus

00:13:06.159 --> 00:13:06.960
will be tripled

00:13:07.679 --> 00:13:08.320
Really

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.759
Really

00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:12.840
Well, since you put it that way

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.919
If you are saying it like that

00:13:16.039 --> 00:13:17.639
I do have a new idea

00:13:29.799 --> 00:13:30.879
Officer Yang, look

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:38.519
How did you find it

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.399
The dancers found it while they were changing
