1
00:00:22,335 --> 00:00:24,212
Hey, can you keep it down?

2
00:00:29,467 --> 00:00:31,553
I told you to keep it down.

3
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:35,807
-Hey.
-Keep it down, okay?

4
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:38,184
Your sister has homework.

5
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:44,399
Making progress?

6
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:46,276
-Yeah.
-Mom.

7
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:47,944
-It's written really well.
-Really?

8
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:49,946
Yeah, it's very neat.

9
00:00:51,322 --> 00:00:54,784
My parents always sided
with my elder sister.

10
00:00:57,162 --> 00:00:58,329
I'm home.

11
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:06,921
They're not the biggest agency,

12
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:10,133
but many of their talents
are in dramas and magazines.

13
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:14,012
They said I could be on TV
if I worked hard and took lessons.

14
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:15,722
Are you being serious?

15
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:19,475
I am. I'm going to quit school
and move to Tokyo soon.

16
00:01:19,559 --> 00:01:21,477
Don't be foolish.

17
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:23,730
It's not going to be that easy.

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,107
What do you mean, "foolish?"

19
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:29,736
At least go to college first.

20
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:35,909
Riko.

21
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,411
I'm not the same as you.

22
00:01:38,494 --> 00:01:42,081
I'll live my life my own way!

23
00:01:42,916 --> 00:01:44,751
Hey, wait. Riko!

24
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,847
I wanted to make my family accept me.

25
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:06,481
After defying my parents' wishes,
I found myself breathing the Tokyo air,

26
00:02:07,357 --> 00:02:09,859
which was murky and full of exhaust fumes.

27
00:02:10,777 --> 00:02:14,155
But to me, it was the smell of freedom.

28
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:16,783
A smell I didn't have back home.

29
00:02:18,618 --> 00:02:20,245
Here we are.

30
00:02:20,745 --> 00:02:22,664
Feel free to use the slippers.

31
00:02:23,665 --> 00:02:26,709
This one was built 50 years ago.

32
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:31,381
And it's far from the station
with no automatic lock on the door,

33
00:02:31,464 --> 00:02:34,467
so it's not the best place
for a woman to live alone.

34
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,429
But considering your budget,
this is about what you can get.

35
00:02:41,432 --> 00:02:44,560
Everything related to water usage
should be relatively new, though.

36
00:02:47,188 --> 00:02:53,111
But if I recall, the water heater
for the bath is an older model.

37
00:02:58,741 --> 00:02:59,993
I'll take it.

38
00:03:00,785 --> 00:03:02,245
MK PROMOTION

39
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:03,871
This will be your stage name.

40
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:05,790
Risa Hirayama.

41
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:08,501
You'll have to pass
the trial period first, though.

42
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:10,795
Your lessons will cost 30,000 yen monthly.

43
00:03:11,546 --> 00:03:16,551
Whether you get officially signed on
with us will depend on your performance.

44
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:21,180
Sorry, I was told my lesson fees
would be covered for me.

45
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:24,517
Oh, that's only
after you are officially signed on.

46
00:03:28,021 --> 00:03:28,813
Is that okay?

47
00:03:30,023 --> 00:03:31,607
Yes, I understand.

48
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:32,775
Good.

49
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,992
I started part-time work
to cover my lesson fees.

50
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:44,037
Ms. Hirata, restock the drinks after that.

51
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,038
Okay.

52
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:48,499
I genuinely believed
what my manager told me.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,460
Ready? Start.

54
00:03:51,878 --> 00:03:53,963
Don't you get why Yuu feels so sad?

55
00:03:54,047 --> 00:03:56,507
Stop. You don't have to fight over this.

56
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:57,467
This is important.

57
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:00,595
How would I get it?
She just randomly started crying.

58
00:04:00,678 --> 00:04:01,471
That's why you--

59
00:04:01,554 --> 00:04:04,015
-Ms. Hirayama, put more emotion in it.
-Okay.

60
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:08,603
Unfortunately, we will not be
signing you on this time either.

61
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:10,938
I see.

62
00:04:11,606 --> 00:04:13,149
But you're really close.

63
00:04:13,232 --> 00:04:16,152
How about you keep
taking lessons a little longer?

64
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:20,239
Look, it's not just me.

65
00:04:20,323 --> 00:04:23,534
Others in the agency agree
there's something special about you!

66
00:04:26,204 --> 00:04:27,622
Let's keep trying.

67
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,168
Okay, I will.

68
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:36,214
Also, the lesson fees will go up
by 5,000 to 35,000 yen from this month.

69
00:04:36,964 --> 00:04:38,800
-Sorry?
-Hope it's not an issue.

70
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:40,259
Please sign here.

71
00:04:42,136 --> 00:04:43,137
Right here.

72
00:04:45,723 --> 00:04:46,599
Okay.

73
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:53,272
Thinking back on it now,

74
00:04:53,356 --> 00:04:58,111
I'm sure he must have said the same thing
to dozens or even hundreds of people.

75
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:02,740
Hey, can you man the register?

76
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:03,658
Coming.

77
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:06,828
And yet,
all I could do was trust his words.

78
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:08,121
Sorry for the wait.

79
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:11,874
-Stay away!
-Stop.

80
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:13,251
Don't do it!

81
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:14,836
This doesn't concern you two.

82
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:17,672
Do you have any idea how I feel?
How could you?

83
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:20,925
-Let's switch now.
-Okay.

84
00:05:27,723 --> 00:05:30,852
Stay away. This doesn't concern you two.

85
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:31,769
RIKO HIRATA

86
00:05:38,818 --> 00:05:41,821
Before I knew it, three years had gone by.

87
00:05:50,121 --> 00:05:51,330
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS?

88
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:56,169
NEXT STAR AUDITION 2020

89
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:04,051
CEO, YOKO KODAMA
WE WANT TO UNCOVER YOUR UNIQUE TALENT

90
00:06:06,512 --> 00:06:08,514
I decided to bet everything on it.

91
00:06:09,932 --> 00:06:14,562
The Kodama Productions
Next Star Audition 2020.

92
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:18,816
The winner of this
tournament-style audition

93
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,445
will be officially signed on
with Kodama Productions,

94
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:27,241
and be awarded a lead role in a movie.

95
00:06:27,325 --> 00:06:30,119
I thought of it as my last chance.

96
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,331
One, and two, and three, and four.

97
00:06:33,414 --> 00:06:35,791
Five, six, seven, eight.

98
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,919
One, two, three, four.

99
00:06:38,002 --> 00:06:39,837
Looking good, Ms. Hara!

100
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:42,590
Ms. Hirasawa, you're falling behind.

101
00:06:42,673 --> 00:06:48,638
Four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, and four, and five.

102
00:06:49,263 --> 00:06:51,474
-Hello there.
-Oh, hello.

103
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:54,185
Hi there.

104
00:06:56,354 --> 00:06:57,438
Hello.

105
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:02,068
-Thank you. Good luck.
-Thank you.

106
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:04,153
Ms. Hirayama?

107
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:05,947
-Yes?
-I'd like a comment.

108
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,448
What is it that drives you?

109
00:07:08,074 --> 00:07:08,908
Right.

110
00:07:10,034 --> 00:07:13,663
I left my home against my parents' wishes.

111
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:16,457
I know they must be worried,

112
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:19,710
so I want to put them at ease
by showing some results.

113
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:31,764
"Say something."

114
00:07:31,847 --> 00:07:34,225
"Do you know how precious it was to me?"

115
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:37,770
"It's a treasure from…"

116
00:07:37,853 --> 00:07:40,815
"It's a treasure I received
from someone dear to me."

117
00:07:41,524 --> 00:07:44,360
"It's a treasure I received
from someone dear to me."

118
00:07:47,863 --> 00:07:50,700
"What's with that attitude?
Say something."

119
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,868
"Do you know how precious it was to me?"

120
00:07:53,452 --> 00:07:55,496
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

121
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:00,376
I wanted more time to practice,
so I started work as a hostess.

122
00:08:00,459 --> 00:08:02,628
You're a heavy drinker, huh?

123
00:08:02,712 --> 00:08:03,629
Go for one more?

124
00:08:03,713 --> 00:08:05,548
-Sure.
-I'd love to.

125
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,801
We've kept you waiting long enough.

126
00:08:08,884 --> 00:08:13,264
Now, we'll announce the winner
who passed the final review.

127
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:23,232
The winner of the Kodama Productions
Next Star Audition 2020 is…

128
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:31,532
Ms. Yuri Hara!

129
00:08:31,616 --> 00:08:33,034
Congratulations!

130
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:38,372
Come to the center of the stage.

131
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:44,337
It was my last chance.

132
00:08:45,463 --> 00:08:46,714
-Did you hear?
-What?

133
00:08:46,797 --> 00:08:48,382
That the audition was rigged.

134
00:08:48,466 --> 00:08:49,383
Seriously?

135
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:53,888
Apparently, the agency did it
to get publicity for their talent's debut.

136
00:08:53,971 --> 00:08:56,682
I guess it's all about who you know, huh?

137
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,499
And it was then of all times…

138
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,125
LANTERN FOR THE DEPARTED

139
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:24,418
He was still so young.

140
00:09:26,128 --> 00:09:27,838
I feel sorry for the wife.

141
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:22,184
Why didn't you come?

142
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:54,675
HEY, IT'S MARIKA

143
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,636
WANT TO GET DRINKS WITH
HIDETA ASO FROM KODAMA PRODUCTIONS?

144
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,888
GOOD NETWORKING CHANCE!

145
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:04,935
Try it sometime.

146
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:07,980
-Can you keep going?
-Of course. We just got started.

147
00:11:09,398 --> 00:11:11,400
You're good with your drinks, I see.

148
00:11:11,484 --> 00:11:12,693
I like that.

149
00:11:12,776 --> 00:11:14,737
-So, where are you from?
-Kyoto.

150
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,113
Wait, me too!

151
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:17,698
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

152
00:11:17,781 --> 00:11:21,327
-Not just trying to hit on her?
-No, I'm being for real right now.

153
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:34,423
SORRY, SOMETHING CAME UP,
SO I CAN'T MAKE IT.

154
00:11:45,017 --> 00:11:46,060
Enjoying yourself?

155
00:11:47,061 --> 00:11:47,895
Mr. Aso.

156
00:11:48,646 --> 00:11:49,522
Are you alone?

157
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:51,190
Care to join me?

158
00:11:52,525 --> 00:11:53,442
Yes.

159
00:11:56,737 --> 00:12:00,032
So you quit high school
and moved to Tokyo alone?

160
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,867
Yes.

161
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,580
My parents opposed it,
so I basically ran away from home.

162
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:10,918
But things haven't gone well since then.

163
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,051
I actually took an audition
for your agency recently.

164
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:20,386
For us?

165
00:12:20,469 --> 00:12:21,387
Yes.

166
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:25,224
But I didn't make it past the final stage.

167
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:31,647
I decided to come here today
because I thought I could get to meet you,

168
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,984
and ask what you think I'm lacking.

169
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:39,905
Maybe the judges just lacked taste.

170
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:44,702
You have a lot of charm, if you ask me.

171
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:50,249
I can hear you out if you want.

172
00:12:52,334 --> 00:12:53,794
Will you really?

173
00:12:53,877 --> 00:12:57,214
Mr. Aso, we'll be leaving first then.

174
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:00,092
Thank you.

175
00:13:00,175 --> 00:13:01,385
Take care.

176
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:02,636
See you again.

177
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:08,350
How about another drink?

178
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:10,227
What?

179
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:11,895
Or will you go home?

180
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:14,690
I'm fine either way.

181
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:18,611
How about it?

182
00:13:20,904 --> 00:13:23,949
I'll stay. I want to talk more with you.

183
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:26,201
Come with me then.

184
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:58,067
Thank you.

185
00:13:58,150 --> 00:13:59,068
Cheers.

186
00:13:59,151 --> 00:14:00,027
Cheers.

187
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:11,664
Here.

188
00:14:11,747 --> 00:14:13,123
Thank you.

189
00:14:38,023 --> 00:14:40,818
Sorry, I think I drank too much.

190
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:51,620
Wait. Stop it!

191
00:14:51,704 --> 00:14:53,372
That hurt.

192
00:14:54,415 --> 00:14:57,584
I'm sorry. But that's not why I…

193
00:14:57,668 --> 00:14:58,877
Just leave then.

194
00:15:01,588 --> 00:15:04,008
If that's the extent of your resolve.

195
00:15:11,056 --> 00:15:12,349
Just kidding.

196
00:15:13,392 --> 00:15:16,228
I'm willing to help you out, you know.

197
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:19,273
I can connect you to the right people.

198
00:15:55,726 --> 00:15:57,895
I'm leaving first, okay?

199
00:15:57,978 --> 00:15:59,438
Have a shoot to get to.

200
00:16:01,065 --> 00:16:02,733
Here's your taxi fare.

201
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:04,485
Bye.

202
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:10,449
Goodbye.

203
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:19,792
"Goodbye"?

204
00:17:04,711 --> 00:17:05,963
I'm fine.

205
00:17:09,967 --> 00:17:10,926
I'm fine.

206
00:17:15,347 --> 00:17:16,473
I'm fine.

207
00:17:20,727 --> 00:17:21,770
I'm fine…

208
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:25,774
I'm fine.

209
00:17:30,904 --> 00:17:34,199
Over and over, I tried to convince myself.

210
00:17:34,283 --> 00:17:35,242
I'm fine.

211
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:37,327
I'm fine.

212
00:17:39,037 --> 00:17:42,499
If I didn't do so, I thought I might snap.

213
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:48,672
In the end, neither Aso nor
Kodama Productions ever contacted me.

214
00:17:50,048 --> 00:17:51,758
I had to face the reality.

215
00:17:55,721 --> 00:17:56,722
I was…

216
00:17:58,056 --> 00:18:02,269
My dream was taken advantage of.

217
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:06,982
I was just used by him…

218
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:11,236
as an outlet for his sexual desires.

219
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:16,408
That was five years ago.

220
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:21,413
Let's take a break.

221
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:24,124
Please let me continue.

222
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,627
-But--
-I want to tell you.

223
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:28,337
All of it.

224
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:32,799
Tell me if it gets too much.

225
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:38,722
Did you ask anyone for help?

226
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:44,811
I told my agency about it,
and they let me go the next day.

227
00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:46,313
What?

228
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:48,190
My manager said,

229
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:52,945
"Don't drag us into this. We don't want
any issues with Kodama Productions."

230
00:18:53,028 --> 00:18:54,321
As he yelled at me.

231
00:18:56,156 --> 00:19:00,410
"Sexual assault? You just tried
to seduce him and failed, didn't you?"

232
00:19:02,287 --> 00:19:04,873
I thought, "Oh, I see."

233
00:19:05,582 --> 00:19:07,626
"I guess that wasn't sexual assault."

234
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,380
"It's just an excuse
that I couldn't fight back."

235
00:19:11,463 --> 00:19:14,174
"It was my fault for going to the party

236
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:18,971
and trying to get close to him,
so I could get more work."

237
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:22,140
"It was all my fault."

238
00:19:22,224 --> 00:19:23,392
"I deserved it."

239
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,478
"So there was nothing to be done."

240
00:19:28,522 --> 00:19:29,898
Did you try the police?

241
00:19:32,818 --> 00:19:33,777
I couldn't.

242
00:19:34,945 --> 00:19:36,738
I thought they wouldn't bother.

243
00:19:40,075 --> 00:19:46,248
But as time went on,
I started to feel detached from it.

244
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:51,044
It started to feel less real,
almost like it was a bad dream.

245
00:19:52,921 --> 00:19:54,381
What was I fussing over?

246
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,883
I'm totally fine now.

247
00:20:00,095 --> 00:20:03,056
I probably looked normal to others.

248
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:08,395
But for that entire period,

249
00:20:09,229 --> 00:20:13,442
I wasn't even sure
whether I was alive or dead.

250
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,530
Everything felt so dull,
no matter what I did.

251
00:20:18,613 --> 00:20:20,824
-That'll be 2,700 yen.
-Okay.

252
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:27,456
I tried to maintain
a sense of normalcy on the outside.

253
00:20:28,957 --> 00:20:32,461
I would remember
that day less and less often.

254
00:20:33,462 --> 00:20:35,088
To a secure future.

255
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,341
However…

256
00:20:39,426 --> 00:20:43,805
I hadn't gotten over it even a little bit.

257
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,397
We want to protect your smile
and the smiles of those dear to you.

258
00:20:54,107 --> 00:20:56,526
Japan Sanwa Insurance.

259
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:03,658
Why did I, the victim, have to suffer,
while he, the assailant, gets to smile?

260
00:21:05,911 --> 00:21:10,290
At that moment,
I felt immense rage for the first time.

261
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:13,919
I can't forgive him.

262
00:21:14,002 --> 00:21:15,337
I refuse to.

263
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,051
As long as he stays in the limelight,

264
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:25,222
until he is judged for his sins
and forced out of this industry,

265
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,770
I will never be able
to regain control of my life.

266
00:21:35,148 --> 00:21:36,691
That's why you went to Buncho?

267
00:21:37,651 --> 00:21:41,321
Weekly Buncho covered many scandals
in the entertainment industry,

268
00:21:41,405 --> 00:21:43,573
so I thought they'd publish it.

269
00:21:45,242 --> 00:21:48,370
Though I didn't know
you were a reporter for them.

270
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:54,042
But that article
was ultimately suppressed.

271
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:56,336
After that,

272
00:21:57,003 --> 00:22:01,216
someone from Kodama Productions
strongly urged me to settle.

273
00:22:02,926 --> 00:22:09,182
But now, after meeting you
and hearing what you had to say,

274
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,189
I've decided I don't want this
to be settled with money.

275
00:22:19,484 --> 00:22:20,902
I want him to atone.

276
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:23,572
I want him to apologize.

277
00:22:23,655 --> 00:22:26,199
I want to expose all his wrongdoings!

278
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,665
Is that strange of me?
After all this time?

279
00:22:36,209 --> 00:22:37,460
It's not.

280
00:22:40,088 --> 00:22:41,464
It's not strange at all.

281
00:22:47,304 --> 00:22:49,806
Have you ever heard of dissociation?

282
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:53,101
Victims of sexual assault
distance themselves

283
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:58,398
from what happened to them in order
to protect themselves from the trauma.

284
00:22:59,941 --> 00:23:04,529
I think you did so as well.
To keep yourself sane all this time.

285
00:23:06,114 --> 00:23:10,160
And after spending a long time
coming to terms with the facts,

286
00:23:10,243 --> 00:23:14,539
you finally recognized the anger
that was inside you all along.

287
00:23:15,373 --> 00:23:18,418
But I'm the one who made the choice to go.

288
00:23:19,628 --> 00:23:21,588
It was absolutely not your fault.

289
00:23:22,631 --> 00:23:26,968
Aso abused his superior status
in the entertainment industry

290
00:23:27,052 --> 00:23:29,930
and took advantage of your aspiration.

291
00:23:30,013 --> 00:23:32,682
And you were alone
with him in a private room.

292
00:23:33,391 --> 00:23:35,268
It would've been tough to resist.

293
00:23:38,355 --> 00:23:40,815
When he said, "Just leave then,"

294
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:44,152
I thought if I defied him,

295
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:48,156
I wouldn't be able
to stay in the industry anymore.

296
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:51,826
I couldn't go against him
when I thought of that.

297
00:23:53,662 --> 00:23:57,749
What Aso did
was undeniably sexual assault.

298
00:23:59,334 --> 00:24:01,962
There's no need for you to blame yourself.

299
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,466
No one's ever…

300
00:24:07,717 --> 00:24:09,594
said that to me before.

301
00:24:13,765 --> 00:24:17,143
I'll try one more time
to make this into an article.

302
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:21,815
The problem is,

303
00:24:22,524 --> 00:24:28,071
even if we keep your identity hidden,
people will likely slander you anyway.

304
00:24:28,154 --> 00:24:32,784
Of course, we'll do our utmost
to ensure you can't be identified.

305
00:24:33,702 --> 00:24:34,953
I understand.

306
00:24:35,036 --> 00:24:39,332
Also, I can't write an article based
on just the information you've provided.

307
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:41,918
I need other sources.

308
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:45,171
Why? Do you think I'm lying too?

309
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:47,007
I trust you, Riko.

310
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:54,055
But the public won't
just take your word for it.

311
00:24:55,598 --> 00:24:58,810
"Where's the proof?
Did she just fabricate it?"

312
00:24:59,686 --> 00:25:02,022
They'll be sure to respond with scrutiny.

313
00:25:03,023 --> 00:25:07,569
Not to mention, Kodama Productions
and Aso will most likely respond too.

314
00:25:09,988 --> 00:25:13,450
So we have to get the accounts
of the other people at the party,

315
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:15,910
and build our case
with supporting evidence.

316
00:25:17,787 --> 00:25:19,622
It'll take some time.

317
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:25,128
So I need you to be patient
and keep all this a secret.

318
00:25:26,463 --> 00:25:27,297
Okay.

319
00:25:34,637 --> 00:25:35,889
I'm grateful…

320
00:25:38,224 --> 00:25:39,267
that you told me.

321
00:26:14,552 --> 00:26:16,137
I'll see her home.

322
00:26:17,514 --> 00:26:20,725
Let me know when you pin down
the participants of that party

323
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:22,644
and need to get in touch with them.

324
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:24,979
I'll help as much as I'm able.

325
00:26:25,063 --> 00:26:26,523
I appreciate it.

326
00:26:27,107 --> 00:26:27,941
Bye then.

327
00:26:39,577 --> 00:26:40,620
Ms. Saki!

328
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,040
Can you come with me?

329
00:26:44,124 --> 00:26:44,999
Sure.

330
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:04,227
Over here.

331
00:27:05,061 --> 00:27:07,730
-Good work.
-Hello.

332
00:27:10,984 --> 00:27:16,364
About that online drama, Mr. Fujiwara
is now officially a part of it!

333
00:27:17,449 --> 00:27:18,783
Really?

334
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:20,160
That's great.

335
00:27:23,621 --> 00:27:26,624
Chief, you don't look very excited.

336
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,501
You can look a little happier.

337
00:27:28,585 --> 00:27:30,545
Mori worked hard for this.

338
00:27:31,921 --> 00:27:32,922
You're right.

339
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:34,424
Good job, Mori.

340
00:27:35,508 --> 00:27:36,509
Thank you.

341
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:42,182
Ms. Yoko won't try to sabotage me again,
will she?

342
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,310
It'll be fine.

343
00:27:46,728 --> 00:27:49,355
I won't let Kodama Pro do as they please.

344
00:27:50,273 --> 00:27:54,444
Let's put a stop to this absurd injustice.

345
00:27:57,071 --> 00:28:00,450
It's just as Hashimoto,
the editor-in-chief, told us.

346
00:28:01,451 --> 00:28:03,244
I hardly believed it at first.

347
00:28:06,956 --> 00:28:10,793
You mean Ioka is also involved in this?

348
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:13,338
What shall we do?

349
00:28:14,088 --> 00:28:17,342
Given that she's in contact
with Ioka and the reporter from Buncho,

350
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:19,677
she likely won't agree to settle.

351
00:28:21,554 --> 00:28:26,017
As long as Mr. Hashimoto is on our side,
Weekly Buncho won't publish their article.

352
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,855
However, we should make
our move sooner rather than later.

353
00:28:44,035 --> 00:28:45,328
Mr. Kondo?

354
00:28:46,454 --> 00:28:49,833
I need your help with something.

355
00:29:13,731 --> 00:29:14,858
Ninomiya.

356
00:29:18,152 --> 00:29:19,237
Can we talk?

357
00:29:26,995 --> 00:29:31,082
I talked to the victim
in the Aso sexual assault story.

358
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:36,546
I plan to write an article on it.

359
00:29:36,629 --> 00:29:38,131
You're still on that?

360
00:29:38,214 --> 00:29:40,675
You'll never get it published
in Weekly Buncho.

361
00:29:40,758 --> 00:29:43,261
That's why I need your help.

362
00:29:43,928 --> 00:29:47,181
Find a publisher that won't bow to
Kodama Productions.

363
00:29:47,265 --> 00:29:49,726
You have more connections
in the industry than me.

364
00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:52,395
Don't be ridiculous.
What about my standing?

365
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:56,524
What about your standing as a journalist?

366
00:29:57,233 --> 00:30:02,238
The perpetrator's crimes are covered up,
while the victim is forced to stay quiet.

367
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:04,657
Do you really find that acceptable?

368
00:30:04,741 --> 00:30:06,451
Why are you so invested in this?

369
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:13,249
If you're going to get this invested
in strangers, this job's not for you.

370
00:30:17,503 --> 00:30:19,505
The victim is my little sister.

371
00:30:24,802 --> 00:30:28,348
I didn't know that
until I actually met her.

372
00:30:29,682 --> 00:30:32,602
You're saying that girl is…

373
00:30:38,608 --> 00:30:42,403
You want to write the article
for your sister's sake?

374
00:30:43,154 --> 00:30:44,030
Yes.

375
00:30:45,031 --> 00:30:46,616
But that's not all.

376
00:30:48,618 --> 00:30:53,414
When I learned that she was the victim,
I finally understood.

377
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:57,126
The people in news stories
aren't just strangers.

378
00:30:58,586 --> 00:31:01,798
People dear to us
could become victims at any time.

379
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:09,389
That's why we, as reporters,
have to uncover and publicize the facts.

380
00:31:12,433 --> 00:31:15,228
I should've realized that sooner, huh?

381
00:32:05,069 --> 00:32:06,612
What's this?

382
00:32:07,488 --> 00:32:08,406
Can you tell?

383
00:32:09,657 --> 00:32:11,200
It's a cloud!

384
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:14,370
I see that smile.

385
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:16,581
-Mirei.
-You're so cute.

386
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:20,918
Don't get the wrong idea.

387
00:32:21,627 --> 00:32:22,754
I haven't forgiven you.

388
00:32:25,757 --> 00:32:28,843
I just don't want to be known
as the woman who got cheated on

389
00:32:28,926 --> 00:32:31,429
and had her marriage collapse.

390
00:32:34,307 --> 00:32:35,433
What is it?

391
00:32:36,392 --> 00:32:37,810
You're so cute.

392
00:32:38,436 --> 00:32:40,271
I'll get your food ready, okay?

393
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:14,931
Ms. Mori contacted me.

394
00:33:16,432 --> 00:33:18,726
Said you got a role in an online drama.

395
00:33:20,686 --> 00:33:21,604
Yeah.

396
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:28,236
Work your ass off.

397
00:33:40,873 --> 00:33:41,874
Also, this.

398
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:45,336
It's still a prototype.

399
00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:49,465
But I'm thinking of starting a new brand
and selling anti-cheating underwear.

400
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,718
You'll model for it, okay?

401
00:33:56,806 --> 00:33:58,599
You lost me there.

402
00:34:05,606 --> 00:34:07,275
What's wrong, sweetie?

403
00:34:07,358 --> 00:34:08,526
What?

404
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:11,070
You hungry? Let's get some food.

405
00:34:28,004 --> 00:34:30,256
Are you Riko Hirata?

406
00:34:32,884 --> 00:34:35,178
I'm Kondo, a freelance journalist.

407
00:34:38,264 --> 00:34:40,766
You're trying to get
an article published, right?

408
00:34:42,435 --> 00:34:44,645
About a big-name actor's sexual assault.

409
00:34:45,605 --> 00:34:48,149
A bunch of people have been
making false accusations,

410
00:34:48,232 --> 00:34:50,401
trying to get publicity
or settlement money

411
00:34:50,484 --> 00:34:53,905
by taking advantage of
the recent MeToo Movement.

412
00:34:53,988 --> 00:34:57,658
I'm writing a special feature
on such cases, which brings me here.

413
00:34:58,492 --> 00:35:01,370
Are you accusing me of lying?

414
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:08,628
There are people who saw you arguing
with a member of a major talent agency.

415
00:35:08,711 --> 00:35:10,379
Over settlement money, they said.

416
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:11,964
That's not--

417
00:35:12,048 --> 00:35:15,593
You made a false accusation
and demanded settlement money, didn't you?

418
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:20,514
But they ignored your demands, so now
you're trying to get an article out.

419
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:22,016
Am I wrong?

420
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:23,643
That's not true! I'm not--

421
00:35:23,726 --> 00:35:25,686
You're short on cash, aren't you?

422
00:35:26,938 --> 00:35:29,482
And you work as a hostess, right?

423
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,490
Don't record without my permission!

424
00:35:37,573 --> 00:35:39,033
Come on now.

425
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:43,162
I'll include this in the article, okay?

426
00:36:09,313 --> 00:36:10,189
Riko?

427
00:36:19,156 --> 00:36:22,994
A reporter visited me. Said I'm lying
for publicity and settlement money.

428
00:36:23,077 --> 00:36:23,911
What?

429
00:36:23,995 --> 00:36:27,290
If he writes that in an article,
no one will believe me!

430
00:36:27,373 --> 00:36:30,835
I only told you guys about it.
How did he know?

431
00:36:30,918 --> 00:36:31,919
Did you tell him?

432
00:36:32,003 --> 00:36:34,297
Of course not. Calm down.

433
00:36:35,298 --> 00:36:37,967
I promise I'll find out how this happened.

434
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:39,010
Okay?

435
00:36:50,229 --> 00:36:51,939
How's Ms. Riko?

436
00:36:52,023 --> 00:36:54,608
I told her not to go outside for now.

437
00:36:54,692 --> 00:36:56,610
She was pretty shaken last night.

438
00:36:58,029 --> 00:37:00,489
How do you think
they found out about this?

439
00:37:01,324 --> 00:37:04,035
Only one person knows
I'm investigating this story.

440
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:11,459
What do you want?

441
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:14,170
Did you tell anyone about my sister?

442
00:37:15,546 --> 00:37:16,589
What's that about?

443
00:37:17,256 --> 00:37:19,550
A reporter came to my sister's place.

444
00:37:20,176 --> 00:37:21,510
Said he'd write an article,

445
00:37:21,594 --> 00:37:24,889
claiming she's lying about
the assault to get publicity and money.

446
00:37:25,473 --> 00:37:26,474
-It wasn't me.
-But--

447
00:37:26,557 --> 00:37:27,433
I swear.

448
00:37:29,101 --> 00:37:30,144
And also…

449
00:37:38,444 --> 00:37:41,113
That article's already out.

450
00:37:41,197 --> 00:37:42,073
What?

451
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:46,619
"A former talent, now a hostess,

452
00:37:46,702 --> 00:37:50,247
falsely accused a famous actor
of sexual assault for settlement money."

453
00:37:51,582 --> 00:37:53,167
But how…?

454
00:38:02,843 --> 00:38:04,845
YASUO KONDO, FREELANCE JOURNALIST

455
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:17,441
Ma'am!

456
00:38:19,235 --> 00:38:21,112
IS RISA HIRAYAMA THE MENTIONED TALENT?

457
00:38:21,946 --> 00:38:23,823
SERIOUSLY? IT'S RISA HIRAYAMA?

458
00:38:23,906 --> 00:38:25,533
They got us.

459
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:30,329
Even if Ms. Riko's article comes out now,
people won't take it at face value.

460
00:38:30,413 --> 00:38:33,457
You think Kodama Productions
is behind this?

461
00:38:43,801 --> 00:38:45,219
-Hello.
-Riko?

462
00:38:46,554 --> 00:38:47,471
What?

463
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,391
You didn't answer my calls. I was worried.

464
00:38:51,767 --> 00:38:56,021
About that article,
I'm sorry I couldn't stop it.

465
00:38:57,356 --> 00:38:59,483
Are you at home? I'll come over.

466
00:39:00,234 --> 00:39:01,152
Don't.

467
00:39:01,902 --> 00:39:02,820
But…

468
00:39:03,571 --> 00:39:05,281
Just don't.

469
00:39:05,364 --> 00:39:06,699
I'm fine.

470
00:39:08,284 --> 00:39:10,161
Get some rest, okay?

471
00:39:10,244 --> 00:39:12,621
We'll think of a countermeasure.

472
00:39:12,705 --> 00:39:14,123
Call me if anything happens.

473
00:39:14,707 --> 00:39:15,541
Okay.

474
00:39:16,792 --> 00:39:17,668
Riko?

475
00:39:33,517 --> 00:39:34,560
See you tomorrow.

476
00:39:36,061 --> 00:39:39,106
Hirata, finish the article
for the web edition by tomorrow.

477
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,649
-Okay.
-Thanks.

478
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:43,194
Good night.

479
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,760
Good morning.

480
00:40:08,928 --> 00:40:09,970
Hello.

481
00:40:12,348 --> 00:40:13,307
Morning.

482
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:18,979
Hello?

483
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:21,482
This is Ioka. Did you see it?

484
00:40:22,149 --> 00:40:22,983
What?

485
00:40:35,037 --> 00:40:36,664
To Sengawa, please.

486
00:41:01,564 --> 00:41:03,941
Ms. Riko's post
is getting heavy criticism.

487
00:41:05,234 --> 00:41:07,528
You should go to her immediately.

488
00:41:08,445 --> 00:41:09,655
Okay.

489
00:41:13,993 --> 00:41:20,583
Five years ago,
I was sexually assaulted by Hideta Aso.

490
00:41:21,875 --> 00:41:26,922
That night, I went to a drinking party
attended by people in the industry.

491
00:41:27,506 --> 00:41:34,179
In the end, I was left alone with Aso,
and he then assaulted me.

492
00:41:36,098 --> 00:41:39,018
I've tried to speak out
about it several times,

493
00:41:39,101 --> 00:41:41,437
but I was silenced every time.

494
00:41:42,938 --> 00:41:45,983
I was even betrayed
by the people I trusted.

495
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:51,780
Everything written
in that article is a complete lie.

496
00:41:51,864 --> 00:41:53,073
TRASH HUMAN BEING

497
00:41:53,157 --> 00:41:54,450
Please believe me.

498
00:41:54,533 --> 00:41:57,244
WHAT A VULGAR WOMAN
I'M DISGUSTED

499
00:42:01,665 --> 00:42:02,791
Please hurry.

500
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,052
Thank you.

501
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,106
Riko?

502
00:42:26,774 --> 00:42:27,816
Riko?

503
00:42:28,734 --> 00:42:29,985
Riko!

504
00:42:44,208 --> 00:42:45,834
Riko!

505
00:42:46,335 --> 00:42:47,169
Riko!

506
00:42:55,552 --> 00:42:56,512
Riko!

507
00:42:57,554 --> 00:42:58,639
Riko!

508
00:43:30,212 --> 00:43:33,757
I'm curious what choice he'll make.
Aren't you?

509
00:43:34,341 --> 00:43:35,551
PREVIEW

510
00:43:35,634 --> 00:43:37,261
THE FINAL EPISODE

511
00:43:37,344 --> 00:43:39,722
I haven't changed a bit since then.

512
00:43:39,805 --> 00:43:42,391
IOKA'S PAST WITH KODAMA BECOMES KNOWN

513
00:43:42,474 --> 00:43:46,729
Do you really think you can antagonize
Kodama Pro and still get by?

514
00:43:46,812 --> 00:43:48,147
You monster!

515
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,773
Give my Yuri back!

516
00:43:49,857 --> 00:43:51,233
THE MYSTERIOUS GIRL YURI HARA

517
00:43:52,234 --> 00:43:53,569
We need to talk.

518
00:43:53,652 --> 00:43:56,280
SCATTERED MYSTERIES ARE ALL CONNECTED

519
00:43:56,363 --> 00:43:58,407
What have you been digging into?

520
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,159
You wrote that article.

521
00:44:00,242 --> 00:44:02,953
As if you haven't done
the same thing as well.

522
00:44:03,537 --> 00:44:05,164
Absolutely unbelievable.

523
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,957
So it's finally time.

524
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,584
I'm counting on you, okay?

525
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:10,961
AND THEN, THE FINAL FACE-OFF

526
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:12,796
What are you plotting now?

527
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,508
You've made the wrong decision.
But I'll give you a chance.

528
00:44:16,592 --> 00:44:19,136
They'll attack her again
with baseless speculations.

529
00:44:19,219 --> 00:44:20,471
I thought about dying.

530
00:44:21,096 --> 00:44:22,639
Looks like it went well.

531
00:44:22,723 --> 00:44:23,932
TO COVER IT UP?

532
00:44:24,016 --> 00:44:25,893
You think that's acceptable?

533
00:44:25,976 --> 00:44:29,021
They lost their future
because they were involved with you.

534
00:44:29,104 --> 00:44:30,314
OR TO EXPOSE?

535
00:44:30,397 --> 00:44:33,525
We can't let this injustice continue.

536
00:44:33,609 --> 00:44:37,237
THE FINAL STAGE OF THE OPPOSING SCANDALS

537
00:44:37,321 --> 00:44:42,993
IOKA AND HIRATA ENTER A FINAL FIGHT
TO BRING THE TRUTH TO LIGHT

538
00:44:44,661 --> 00:44:48,123
