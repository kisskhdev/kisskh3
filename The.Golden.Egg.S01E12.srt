FINAL EPISODE

2
00:00:11,716 --> 00:00:16,888
<i>A long day for the </i>Sengoku Weekly
<i>Incident Team was about to begin.</i>

3
00:00:26,598 --> 00:00:32,003
<i>An exclusive interview with</i>
<i>the wanted fugitive Kota Kubozuka.</i>

4
00:00:32,504 --> 00:00:33,371
This way.

5
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,442
Nice to meet you, I'm Kitahama
of the Incident Team.

6
00:00:41,146 --> 00:00:42,046
Please.

7
00:00:47,852 --> 00:00:48,686
What's wrong?

8
00:00:51,122 --> 00:00:53,124
Mr. Watanabe told me

9
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:56,861
there was a woman
who didn't seem to belong at a tabloid.

10
00:00:56,928 --> 00:01:00,798
That she had clear eyes,
and I could trust her.

11
00:01:01,633 --> 00:01:03,067
Is she not here today?

12
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:08,640
I think you mean Shinoda, but she's out
looking for Madoka Hashimoto.

13
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:10,675
What?

14
00:01:10,742 --> 00:01:14,045
She was with you
while you were evading the police, right?

15
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,415
How much do you know?

16
00:01:18,016 --> 00:01:19,751
She won't get arrested, right?

17
00:01:19,817 --> 00:01:22,420
-Don't write about Madoka.
-Don't worry.

18
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:24,856
She won't be in the article.

19
00:01:25,823 --> 00:01:28,893
We won't be contacting
or handing you over to the police.

20
00:01:29,394 --> 00:01:35,166
While there are only old men
with jaded eyes here,

21
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:39,170
in our hearts we just want to help you.

22
00:01:40,705 --> 00:01:43,041
Please, you have nothing to worry about.

23
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:11,869
Will she show up?

24
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:15,139
I'm sure she will.

25
00:02:19,777 --> 00:02:24,182
The first time I met Madoka
was at Seiya Aoshiro's apartment.

26
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:30,588
Mr. Aoshiro looked after me
when I first came to Tokyo from Niigata.

27
00:02:31,256 --> 00:02:35,760
But one day, some fangirl showed up
wanting a look at Mr. Aoshiro.

28
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:38,496
That was Madoka.

29
00:02:40,064 --> 00:02:41,566
You exchanged numbers?

30
00:02:41,633 --> 00:02:42,667
Yes.

31
00:02:42,734 --> 00:02:45,236
She came all by herself
so she caught my interest.

32
00:02:45,303 --> 00:02:46,271
By herself?

33
00:02:47,005 --> 00:02:49,140
How did that come to be?

34
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:51,809
Well.

35
00:02:53,544 --> 00:02:57,715
Madoka was attending a seminar
for aspiring models.

36
00:02:57,782 --> 00:03:02,287
It seems she was close to Harue Komiyama
who she met there.

37
00:03:02,353 --> 00:03:04,722
And Ms. Komiyama invited her.

38
00:03:05,323 --> 00:03:08,459
Have you ever met Ms. Komiyama--

39
00:03:08,526 --> 00:03:09,761
No, I haven't.

40
00:03:09,827 --> 00:03:12,330
So, I'm not acquainted with her at all.

41
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:16,000
The day before Ms. Komiyama's body
was discovered in the park,

42
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:18,303
I had plans to meet with Mr. Aoshiro

43
00:03:18,369 --> 00:03:21,506
and went to the cave bar in Akasaka.

44
00:03:21,572 --> 00:03:25,610
But then I got a message saying
he couldn't make it.

45
00:03:25,677 --> 00:03:27,312
Mr. Aoshiro picked the bar?

46
00:03:27,378 --> 00:03:28,212
Yes.

47
00:03:28,913 --> 00:03:31,749
That's when a pretty woman approached me.

48
00:03:32,483 --> 00:03:36,187
But I suddenly got sleepy
after drinking with her.

49
00:03:37,055 --> 00:03:40,358
Next thing I know, I'm waking up
in a public men's room in the park.

50
00:03:41,826 --> 00:03:46,998
I had no idea Ms. Komiyama was lying dead
just a few feet away in the women's stall.

51
00:03:47,065 --> 00:03:48,633
It wasn't me who killed her!

52
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,534
We know.

53
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:52,003
Mr. Watanabe said the same.

54
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:56,007
We found out a lot of information.

55
00:03:57,442 --> 00:04:03,014
Just between us, I think we can
clear your name.

56
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,989
Please tell us everything you know.

57
00:04:15,693 --> 00:04:16,527
Okay.

58
00:04:19,597 --> 00:04:21,265
Hey, isn't that her?

59
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:23,801
-Madoka!
-Let's go.

60
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:28,406
Hello!

61
00:04:31,576 --> 00:04:33,444
I'm sorry for ambushing you.

62
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:35,279
What?

63
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:37,782
You're Madoka Hashimoto, right?

64
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,084
Who are you?

65
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:44,088
I'm Hinako Shinoda
from the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i>.

66
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:45,890
And I'm Daisuke Tsubaki.

67
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,327
What do you want?

68
00:04:50,228 --> 00:04:52,230
Could we take you home?

69
00:04:53,264 --> 00:04:55,533
I'm sure Kubozuka told you,

70
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,636
but he's sharing his side of the story
at our office.

71
00:04:58,703 --> 00:05:01,639
Don't worry, he's in good hands.

72
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:03,608
Let's go home.

73
00:05:07,412 --> 00:05:08,613
I don't want to.

74
00:05:15,653 --> 00:05:16,721
The doll house!

75
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:24,128
I liked doll houses too.

76
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:30,968
The little bear was waiting for you.

77
00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:33,104
You went to my house?

78
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:34,639
I met your mom.

79
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:37,809
She's really worried about you,
so please go home.

80
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,010
Don't lie.

81
00:05:39,076 --> 00:05:41,479
Your mom mentioned your modeling.

82
00:05:44,849 --> 00:05:45,883
I talked to her.

83
00:05:48,986 --> 00:05:50,054
What's this?

84
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:52,457
TO MADOKA HASHIMOTO

85
00:05:57,962 --> 00:05:59,564
Did something happen?

86
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:04,302
Maybe it was my fault.

87
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:09,407
Madoka dreams of being a model.

88
00:06:11,075 --> 00:06:14,479
When she said she was attending
a seminar for aspiring models,

89
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:17,448
I was absolutely against it.

90
00:06:19,183 --> 00:06:22,086
I told her not to attend
such a shady seminar.

91
00:06:23,221 --> 00:06:24,055
Then

92
00:06:25,456 --> 00:06:30,194
she accused me of being prejudiced,
and got in a huge fight.

93
00:06:32,563 --> 00:06:33,998
I should've

94
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:37,168
been more open

95
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:40,404
and listened to what she had to say.

96
00:06:44,275 --> 00:06:46,110
Your mom regretted her actions.

97
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:48,779
So let's go home.

98
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,887
A little after the first incident,

99
00:06:56,387 --> 00:06:59,223
Mr. Aoshiro asked me for romantic advice.

100
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:05,997
There's this girl I can't get rid of.

101
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:07,965
That's tough.

102
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:10,701
She asks for money every time
we go on a date.

103
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:12,770
Can't you just break up?

104
00:07:15,506 --> 00:07:17,241
It's not that easy.

105
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,480
Could you go get dinner with her
next time I'm abroad?

106
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:24,782
I'll pay for it.

107
00:07:25,616 --> 00:07:26,450
Here.

108
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,086
What?

109
00:07:32,123 --> 00:07:34,225
I'll come up with an excuse.

110
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:35,726
Okay?

111
00:07:36,494 --> 00:07:37,361
Thanks, man.

112
00:07:39,463 --> 00:07:42,199
I couldn't say no after taking the money.

113
00:07:42,266 --> 00:07:47,305
I later met up with her, Ms. Kizaki,
and went back home with her.

114
00:07:49,574 --> 00:07:51,776
I didn't plan to go,

115
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:56,514
but some weird guy with sunglasses
hassled us while we were drinking.

116
00:07:56,581 --> 00:07:57,748
-Huh?
-What?

117
00:07:57,815 --> 00:07:59,250
He spilled alcohol on me.

118
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:03,154
Then Ms. Kizaki offered
to wash them at her place.

119
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,056
That's why you went to her place.

120
00:08:05,122 --> 00:08:06,857
I thought about saying no,

121
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:08,993
but I suddenly got sleepy

122
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,962
and ended up going to her place.

123
00:08:12,363 --> 00:08:14,332
When I woke up, I was in bed,

124
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:17,401
and Ms. Kizaki was lying dead next to me.

125
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,905
The second incident…

126
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:23,341
YUKO KIZAKI

127
00:08:23,908 --> 00:08:25,977
I had no idea what was going on.

128
00:08:26,043 --> 00:08:28,512
I called Mr. Aoshiro right away
'cause I panicked.

129
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:30,815
I swear I didn't do anything!

130
00:08:30,881 --> 00:08:34,885
<i>I know that,</i>
<i>but it doesn't look good for you.</i>

131
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:36,887
<i>You have a prior offense, right?</i>

132
00:08:36,954 --> 00:08:41,092
<i>So even if you're innocent,</i>
<i>maybe you're better off running away?</i>

133
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:42,159
For real?

134
00:08:44,996 --> 00:08:49,100
<i>I'd been living in fear every day</i>
<i>after that.</i>

135
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:52,603
After a while Mr. Aoshiro called me,
asking me to hand a letter

136
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,407
to a woman in Shizuoka
named Makiko Tanioka.

137
00:08:57,241 --> 00:09:00,011
A few days after delivering it,
not suspecting anything,

138
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:02,413
the third death occurred.

139
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:08,786
When I read in news that the footprints
at the scene matched the second case,

140
00:09:09,353 --> 00:09:10,821
<i>I got a bad feeling.</i>

141
00:09:10,888 --> 00:09:13,324
WANTED
KOTA KUBOZUKA (27)

142
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:16,260
<i>Next thing I knew,</i>
<i>I was a wanted fugitive.</i>

143
00:09:18,129 --> 00:09:21,632
<i>Madoka was with me at the time,</i>
<i>and she encouraged me.</i>

144
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:22,700
What's wrong?

145
00:09:23,234 --> 00:09:25,703
I swear I didn't--

146
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,771
Don't worry.

147
00:09:27,538 --> 00:09:29,874
I know it looks bad now,

148
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:32,343
but you'll be cleared.

149
00:09:33,344 --> 00:09:36,080
I mean, you need to clear your name
if it wasn't you!

150
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,389
<i>I knew I shouldn't have depended on her,</i>

151
00:09:45,456 --> 00:09:47,091
<i>but I got her involved in this.</i>

152
00:09:51,595 --> 00:09:54,632
I'd like to apologize to Madoka's family.

153
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,570
<i>When Madoka called her mother once,</i>

154
00:09:59,637 --> 00:10:03,808
<i>she told her she was with me</i>
<i>and not to tell the police.</i>

155
00:10:04,675 --> 00:10:06,911
<i>I feel terrible for worrying her.</i>

156
00:10:17,421 --> 00:10:18,355
Madoka.

157
00:10:37,074 --> 00:10:37,942
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:41,712
I was wrong.

159
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:49,420
Me, too.

160
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,457
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:57,962 --> 00:10:59,096
Welcome home.

162
00:11:10,641 --> 00:11:13,677
Thank you for sharing your side.

163
00:11:15,546 --> 00:11:18,215
What do you want to do now?

164
00:11:21,652 --> 00:11:23,053
I'll stop running,

165
00:11:24,188 --> 00:11:27,191
and try to prove my innocence.

166
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:30,761
In that case,

167
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:40,671
you have the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i>'s
full support.

168
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:46,677
Thank you.

169
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:54,418
You're okay being photographed then?

170
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:56,587
Of course.

171
00:11:56,654 --> 00:11:57,555
Please.

172
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:00,591
Could you look my way?

173
00:12:00,658 --> 00:12:01,492
Okay.

174
00:12:09,099 --> 00:12:11,502
I'm so glad how that worked out.

175
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:12,403
Yes.

176
00:12:23,314 --> 00:12:25,816
-I'll wait for you in the car.
-Thanks.

177
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:29,887
Hello?

178
00:12:29,954 --> 00:12:31,822
<i>Hinako, is now a good time?</i>

179
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:33,490
Sure. What's up?

180
00:12:34,258 --> 00:12:37,494
<i>How about next Sunday</i>
<i>for my visit to Tokyo?</i>

181
00:12:38,863 --> 00:12:40,698
Sure, I'll take some time off.

182
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:43,067
<i>Okay, great.</i>

183
00:12:46,036 --> 00:12:47,137
Hey, Mom.

184
00:12:47,204 --> 00:12:48,138
<i>What, dear?</i>

185
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:54,845
I’ve decided to keep working
as a tabloid reporter.

186
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,681
<i>I see.</i>

187
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,986
<i>If that's what you decided,</i>
<i>you have my support.</i>

188
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:04,488
<i>Just watch your health.</i>

189
00:13:05,122 --> 00:13:08,726
<i>Also, don't do anything</i>
<i>that will make people dislike you.</i>

190
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,529
That might be hard to do,

191
00:13:13,797 --> 00:13:16,600
but I promise not to lie to myself.

192
00:13:17,368 --> 00:13:18,435
So don't worry.

193
00:13:19,503 --> 00:13:20,504
<i>Okay.</i>

194
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:21,906
<i>What are you doing now?</i>

195
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:26,610
I just finished delivering a missing girl
back to her mother.

196
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:30,581
<i>You can't surprise me anymore.</i>

197
00:13:31,148 --> 00:13:33,918
<i>Not after the stakeouts</i>
<i>and undercover work.</i>

198
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:37,755
<i>But let me just say one thing.</i>

199
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:39,156
<i>What?</i>

200
00:13:40,891 --> 00:13:44,261
Does the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i> not have
a Columbo?

201
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:46,096
<i>Here we go again.</i>

202
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:48,232
If you keep doing that kind of work,

203
00:13:48,299 --> 00:13:51,969
you're gonna end up in a gun fight
or having to defuse a bomb.

204
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:55,306
If that happens,

205
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:57,975
I'll go in and help you resign.

206
00:13:58,042 --> 00:13:59,143
Got it?

207
00:14:00,844 --> 00:14:02,146
<i>Starting that night,</i>

208
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:04,848
<i>work really ramped up.</i>

209
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:06,083
Sorry about this, Yamabuki.

210
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:08,986
The more information we have, the better.

211
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:12,556
How's the article coming, Murai?

212
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:14,358
-We got the food.
-Thanks!

213
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:15,426
Keep it up, everyone.

214
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:18,128
Which picture do we go with?

215
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,132
I'd like this first picture somewhere.

216
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:24,101
Doesn't this one look better?

217
00:14:24,168 --> 00:14:29,139
Yes, but this is the moment right after
he prepares himself for what's to come.

218
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:31,508
I see.

219
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:35,879
Okay! We'll put the headline
over this picture.

220
00:14:36,413 --> 00:14:38,449
What's the headline? Let's see…

221
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,484
How about this?

222
00:14:41,585 --> 00:14:46,357
"Framed Fugitive: Firsthand Account
of the Nightmarish Truth."

223
00:14:47,758 --> 00:14:50,561
Mr. Murai, that's perfect. We'll use that.

224
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:51,829
Copy that.

225
00:14:53,197 --> 00:14:54,565
Let's eat, everyone.

226
00:14:54,631 --> 00:14:57,601
Okay, we'll eat and give it one more push.

227
00:14:57,668 --> 00:15:01,138
<i>And so, the latest issue hit the stands.</i>

228
00:15:01,205 --> 00:15:02,039
SENGOKU WEEKLY

229
00:15:05,075 --> 00:15:08,112
FRAMED FUGITIVE: FIRSTHAND ACCOUNT
OF THE NIGHTMARISH TRUTH

230
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:18,522
Hello.

231
00:15:19,223 --> 00:15:20,991
-Good morning.
-Man.

232
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,227
What a reaction.

233
00:15:23,293 --> 00:15:25,329
The phones won't stop ringing.

234
00:15:25,396 --> 00:15:26,897
It's making the rounds online.

235
00:15:26,964 --> 00:15:28,332
Okay, great!

236
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:32,036
Stay vigilant. Let's get to work
on the follow-up.

237
00:15:32,102 --> 00:15:33,037
Yes, sir.

238
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:36,707
Mr. Kitahama, breaking news!

239
00:15:43,514 --> 00:15:48,685
<i>That day, Seiya Aoshiro and</i>
<i>Atsuhiro Imamura were arrested.</i>

240
00:15:51,221 --> 00:15:54,825
You met both of them in person,
didn't you?

241
00:15:55,692 --> 00:15:58,362
I'm glad nothing happened to you!

242
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:00,464
Both arrested for murder.

243
00:16:01,398 --> 00:16:03,233
I'm so curious about what happened!

244
00:16:03,801 --> 00:16:07,438
We'll be covering the motives
in our next issue.

245
00:16:07,504 --> 00:16:08,505
That's amazing.

246
00:16:08,572 --> 00:16:10,007
I have to know.

247
00:16:10,574 --> 00:16:11,408
Tell me!

248
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:15,212
Well, basically what happened is,

249
00:16:15,846 --> 00:16:18,782
Aoshiro and Imamura
both had people to kill.

250
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:22,586
But they knew they'd be the first ones
to be suspected.

251
00:16:23,187 --> 00:16:26,690
So they made a deal to kill
each other's targets and secure alibis.

252
00:16:26,757 --> 00:16:29,593
In other words, a murder swap!

253
00:16:30,194 --> 00:16:34,264
Yes, the serial mysterious deaths case
all began

254
00:16:37,334 --> 00:16:43,107
when Aoshiro's relationship broke down
with the second victim, Yuko Kizaki.

255
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,879
Aoshiro expanded his business after
receiving funds from the rich Ms. Kizaki.

256
00:16:49,546 --> 00:16:52,082
They were also in a sexual relationship.

257
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:56,086
To Aoshiro, Ms. Kizaki was just
a convenient means.

258
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,157
He ended things when he no longer
needed funding,

259
00:17:00,224 --> 00:17:02,793
but she couldn't accept it.

260
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,432
She became a nuisance when
she started pressuring him for marriage.

261
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:14,638
Around that time, he met Imamura
at an industry party.

262
00:17:14,705 --> 00:17:19,543
Imamura's aunt, Ms. Komiyama,
stopped giving him work,

263
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,712
and his company was in danger.

264
00:17:22,312 --> 00:17:24,715
He resented her for it.

265
00:17:25,415 --> 00:17:27,451
Learning of this,

266
00:17:27,518 --> 00:17:30,254
Aoshiro proposed a murder swap

267
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,022
and Imamura agreed.

268
00:17:32,623 --> 00:17:34,091
That was the first murder.

269
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:38,328
Next, Aoshiro went overseas
to create an alibi,

270
00:17:38,395 --> 00:17:41,465
and Imamura went to kill Ms. Kizaki.

271
00:17:41,532 --> 00:17:43,834
That was the second murder.

272
00:17:44,401 --> 00:17:47,304
The third victim, Makiko Tanioka,

273
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:52,442
knew Imamura and Ms. Komiyama and
found Ms. Komiyama's death suspicious.

274
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:57,981
That's when she happened to take
a picture of Imamura and Aoshiro meeting.

275
00:17:58,048 --> 00:18:00,083
She used that to blackmail Aoshiro.

276
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,921
Then, Aoshiro instructed Imamura
to kill Ms. Tanioka

277
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:05,889
and make it look like an accident.

278
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:08,325
That was the third murder.

279
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:12,563
Those are the bullet points
for the serial mysterious deaths story.

280
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:18,135
Ms. Shinoda.

281
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:20,237
You really worked hard!

282
00:18:20,304 --> 00:18:21,371
Good job!

283
00:18:21,438 --> 00:18:23,340
No need to applaud me for it!

284
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:24,508
It's not a big deal.

285
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:26,476
I'm still a rookie.

286
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:27,811
A baby reporter.

287
00:18:28,812 --> 00:18:30,447
Maybe not even a baby.

288
00:18:30,514 --> 00:18:32,316
That'd make you an egg!

289
00:18:33,317 --> 00:18:35,953
I'm trying to incubate something too.

290
00:18:36,587 --> 00:18:37,688
So actually,

291
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:40,591
I'm being transferred this spring.

292
00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:44,828
To the editorial department
of a sports magazine.

293
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:46,230
-What?
-For real?

294
00:18:46,296 --> 00:18:48,932
I'm so worried!

295
00:18:48,999 --> 00:18:50,734
My heart's about to burst.

296
00:18:51,335 --> 00:18:52,903
Help me!

297
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,607
-What do I do?
-Asuka, don't worry!

298
00:18:56,673 --> 00:18:57,741
You poor thing!

299
00:19:05,515 --> 00:19:08,218
<i>People are still buying</i>
<i>the </i>Sengoku Weekly<i>.</i>

300
00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:11,021
SENGOKU WEEKLY

301
00:19:17,794 --> 00:19:21,865
<i>Are my eyes still clear?</i>

302
00:19:26,837 --> 00:19:29,072
This is Shinoda from the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i>.

303
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:31,908
Thank you!

304
00:19:31,975 --> 00:19:33,477
I'll head right over!

305
00:19:33,543 --> 00:19:35,112
Got it. Goodbye.

306
00:19:38,682 --> 00:19:39,516
Okay!

307
00:19:51,028 --> 00:19:52,462
THE END
