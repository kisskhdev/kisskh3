=Episode 4=

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:35.879
I will

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:37.240
take her away now.

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:39.520
Let Boss come to me.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.599
I've already given you chances.
You don't want it.

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:43.199
Get him!

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:47.319
Hold me tight

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:48.199
and close your eyes.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.960
Why standing there?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.840
All go get him!

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:28.199
K,

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.719
you will regret this.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.880
You're awake.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:48.760
Don't worry.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.879
I had a cleaning lady
change your clothes.

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.599
I didn't tell them anything.

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:02.159
Can you untie this for me?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.040
I don't want to be like a prisoner.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.800
You...

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:17.879
What are you doing?

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:22.240
This is a tracker.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:23.520
You lied to me?

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:25.319
Kun won't

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:26.560
give up easily.

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:28.479
If you're in danger,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.879
just press it.

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:30.719
I'll go to save you.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.439
(A tracker?)

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.639
(Then how can I escape?)

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:36.479
Forget about escaping.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.400
If you don't escape,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.680
I can keep you safe.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.680
If you run,

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.319
you'll very likely die.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.920
Understand?

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.520
What if I'm willing to take my chances?

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.240
No one can escape from this island,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.199
including myself.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.919
(It seems I need
to rely on him to leave.)

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:25.080
Not this medicine.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.280
Suddenly so nice to me...

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:41.879
What are you planning?

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:43.719
You saved me.

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:45.840
I'm just repaying you.

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:08.599
That's enough.

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:09.520
I haven't finished.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.680
I don't like being touched.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.680
(He's like a brick wall.)

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.439
The wound on your head

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.680
can be fatal

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.879
if it's not handled properly.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.319
We are in the same boat now.

00:04:23.079 --> 00:04:24.759
You should at least trust me.

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.639
I won't run away anymore,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.800
nor will I reveal anything
about you to anyone.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.120
But I hope

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.400
you can protect me.

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:44.720
Don't you fear I'll betray you?

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:50.040
I believe you are different from them.

♪I decide to wander♪

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:57.279

♪I smile to hide the sorrows♪

♪How long must regrets linger♪

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:04.600
You're so afraid of me.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.680
Yet you trust me?

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.760
Well,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.639
I'm not afraid of you.

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:18.119
Why?

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:24.800
At least you haven't hurt me.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.439
Alright, I will give you a chance.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.800
Tonight we leave the island.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.920
I will hold Kun back for you.

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:40.639
You will help me?

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.959
But if you fail to escape,

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.920
I'll definitely deal with you.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.960
Kun,

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.759
Boss will be back soon.

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:56.560
Will we be doomed?

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.959
The ledger is definitely with K.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.199
He saved that woman.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.399
That means he feels guilty.

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:08.799
Go.

00:06:09.399 --> 00:06:10.600
Find me a woman.

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.279
K.

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.079
What?

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:21.160
You seem unhappy to see me.

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:22.679
Well,

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:24.079
I was impulsive today.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.040
It's my fault.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.560
Dr. Gu,

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.600
I apologize to you.

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:32.519
What?

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:34.319
Why be so petty?

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:35.959
We are buddies.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.639
We share good things.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.840
Today,

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:40.040
I've brought you a gift.

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:46.360
The most beautiful woman in Tai City,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.240
Wanida.

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:52.919
Tonight,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.759
have fun with K.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.920
K,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.759
I want to learn to play billiards too.

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.120
How would you like it?

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.959
I want you to teach me personally.

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:11.599
Okay.

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:14.040
Remember, we have plans tonight.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.079
What plans?

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.319
Make some room, okay?

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.159
Don't get in our way.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.320
Where are you going?

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:27.039
Take this?

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:29.599
Me?

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.640
K,

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.240
aren't you going to teach me?

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.520
Watch carefully.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.840
Put your hand here.

00:07:41.839 --> 00:07:42.679
Relax your waist.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.160
And your shoulders.

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:51.560
Then inhale

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.440
and exhale.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.200
Strike.

00:08:14.079 --> 00:08:14.919
Did you learn it?

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.320
Play by yourself.

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:22.920
Your gift is too much.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.480
Keep it for yourself.

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:36.119
Boss.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:37.799
Why did you come back early?

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.560
Boss.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.759
Is she the woman you fancy?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.840
You don't want any
of the women given to you.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.000
So you like this type.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.200
I think I've seen you somewhere.

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:08.519
Sorry.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.600
I need to use the restroom.

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:19.759
(The person I have been looking for)

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.480
(turns out to be a drug dealer.)

00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:24.159
(Why did he kill my mother?)

00:09:28.919 --> 00:09:30.039
I heard you two

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:31.240
had a big fight

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:32.639
over this woman.

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:33.639
Boss,

00:09:33.679 --> 00:09:34.519
we didn't.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.080
We're still buddies.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.160
K,

00:09:40.559 --> 00:09:41.480
have a drink.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.040
Bro,

00:09:44.279 --> 00:09:45.279
drink this glass of wine

00:09:45.279 --> 00:09:46.320
and forget about today.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:50.320
Come on.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.040
Come on.

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:03.039
I don't drink the wine
handed over by others.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.840
Did you handle the matter
I entrusted to you?

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.600
Yes.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.440
I'll kill you

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
if you err again.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.679
Understood.

00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:25.039
(If I stay, he will recognize me
sooner or later.)

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.040
Gu Nian,

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:35.720
you don't need to go.

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.720
My men

00:10:37.879 --> 00:10:39.480
will take good care of K for you.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.919
What do you mean?

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.799
Even if K was on guard,

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:52.320
he wouldn't know
the drug wasn't in the wine

00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:53.960
but on the rim of the glass.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:10:59.879
K,

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:03.080
compared to that woman,
I'll make you happier.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:12.440
I will take good care of you.
