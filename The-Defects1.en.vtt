The Defects

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.667
Year 2011

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.751
- Boss.
- Yeah?

00:01:15.792 --> 00:01:16.999
We're here.

00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:20.709
You can handle it alone, right?

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:22.000
Yes, of course.

00:01:22.042 --> 00:01:23.918
- Hey, Tae-sik.
- Yes?

00:01:23.959 --> 00:01:27.999
What do you think is inside there?

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:33.584
I'm not interested.

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:38.751
If I were you,
I'd be dying to know.

00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:41.709
Should I tell you?

00:01:42.918 --> 00:01:44.959
That thing I always bring...

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:47.334
Which you pour cement over
and dispose of...

00:01:47.876 --> 00:01:49.209
No, I'm good.

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.334
Why? Are you scared?

00:01:52.542 --> 00:01:53.999
Terrified?

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:57.375
It doesn't matter.
It's just good money.

00:01:59.292 --> 00:02:01.999
You said you need cash
for your mom's surgery, right?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.125
Yes.

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:05.542
You're a good son.

00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:08.375
You'll probably go to heaven.

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:55.584
Please save me.

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:57.584
Please... save me.

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.083
Save me...

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:02.999
Please...

00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:05.709
Please save me.

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:07.209
I don't want to die.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.334
Mister, please save me.

00:03:15.834 --> 00:03:18.459
Please, mister...

Bathhouse

00:05:00.999 --> 00:05:02.709
Breakfast!

00:05:02.751 --> 00:05:03.999
Wha..?

00:05:07.667 --> 00:05:10.000
- Come eat.
- Yeah.

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:18.999
Instant noodles again?

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:23.792
Wow, it smells amazing!

00:05:23.834 --> 00:05:24.584
Who made it?

00:05:24.626 --> 00:05:25.250
Just eat already.

00:05:25.626 --> 00:05:28.999
Unit Three, reporting an incident
at Bukhyeon-dong.

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:33.834
Another morning with
a crazy number of traffic accidents...

00:05:36.542 --> 00:05:39.876
What do you know?
They reset the code word again.

00:05:39.918 --> 00:05:41.709
Where's So-mi?
Is she not eating?

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:44.999
Colly-&gt;Collision

00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:47.999
Gosh...

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:56.667
So-mi!

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:58.209
Hey, sis...

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:01.500
I wonder how she's doing,
you know?

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:05.500
After abandoning me
without a hint of guilt...

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.042
Baby, stop!
Take this with you.

00:06:08.083 --> 00:06:11.083
You didn't eat breakfast,
at least have some soy milk!

00:06:11.125 --> 00:06:13.125
- You woke me up late.
- I'm sorry...

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:17.999
I hope she lives a miserable life.

00:06:30.292 --> 00:06:32.876
Ugh, I'm sick of ramen.

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:34.542
I want chicken.

00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:38.626
Then shall we get some chicken?

00:06:38.667 --> 00:06:41.999
Really? No cap?
Yes!

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:43.751
Guys, let's go!

00:06:44.375 --> 00:06:45.792
What kind of chicken should we get?

00:06:46.042 --> 00:06:47.000
Let's go.

00:07:11.918 --> 00:07:14.709
Come on, you said
we're having chicken.

00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:15.999
Do you have money?

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:20.083
Why does she
always pick on me?

00:07:28.751 --> 00:07:29.709
What?

00:07:35.042 --> 00:07:36.292
Speak up already!

00:07:36.334 --> 00:07:38.000
There are way too many in there.

00:07:39.083 --> 00:07:40.167
Let's just go somewhere else.

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:42.959
There are plenty of gambling houses.

00:07:42.999 --> 00:07:43.959
Scared?

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:46.000
He's terrified.

00:07:47.999 --> 00:07:49.667
Are you talking about me?

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:51.999
I never get scared, okay?

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:55.542
Let's just ask the old man
to buy us chicken!

00:07:55.584 --> 00:07:56.542
Hey!

00:07:56.584 --> 00:07:59.876
The old man's broke.
You just keep eating ramen.

00:07:59.918 --> 00:08:01.751
Why are you such an ass?

00:08:01.792 --> 00:08:03.542
Then we're doing it, okay?

00:08:03.999 --> 00:08:07.000
How about we spice it up?
Make a little bet?

00:08:07.042 --> 00:08:08.999
Alright, let's split teams.

00:08:08.999 --> 00:08:10.751
Finders keepers, okay?

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.042
Losers do cleaning,
laundry, and dishes.

00:08:13.083 --> 00:08:14.667
Fine, whatever.

00:08:14.709 --> 00:08:16.542
Heads or tails!

00:08:18.584 --> 00:08:19.834
Good luck.

00:08:26.459 --> 00:08:27.999
Hey, hey, hey!

00:08:29.209 --> 00:08:30.667
Who are you kids?

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:32.250
How'd you get in?

00:08:32.292 --> 00:08:33.792
We came to play.

00:08:33.834 --> 00:08:34.834
Password.

00:08:34.876 --> 00:08:35.834
Password?

00:08:36.834 --> 00:08:38.500
If you're here to play,
say the password.

00:08:40.334 --> 00:08:41.999
I kind of forgot.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.999
Can you give us the first letter?

00:08:45.918 --> 00:08:47.667
We have money and everything.

00:08:47.709 --> 00:08:49.792
'M'.
The first letter is 'M'.

00:09:01.584 --> 00:09:02.459
Hey, what the hell!

00:09:02.999 --> 00:09:03.999
Sorry.

00:09:41.292 --> 00:09:43.417
This place is huge,
I told you!

00:09:43.459 --> 00:09:45.042
I can't see anything.

00:09:45.083 --> 00:09:46.292
Who's he?

00:09:48.584 --> 00:09:50.792
Come on, I need a king...

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.792
Look, isn't that the safe?

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.999
So, what are we gonna do?

00:10:15.999 --> 00:10:19.667
Joo-an, your big sister
has a plan for everything.

00:10:19.709 --> 00:10:22.042
Hey, I'm older than you!

00:10:22.083 --> 00:10:23.459
You don't act like one.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:24.626
What did you just say?

00:10:24.667 --> 00:10:26.999
As long as it works out,
it's all good!

00:10:27.334 --> 00:10:28.999
- Let's go!
- Wait!

00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:30.626
Wait up!

00:10:40.209 --> 00:10:41.459
Come on.

00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:46.417
Hey!

00:11:08.999 --> 00:11:10.500
What are you? Cops?

00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:14.209
Kill 'em!

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:44.459
Joo-an!

00:12:16.999 --> 00:12:17.999
Catch them!

00:12:19.999 --> 00:12:21.125
Get the other side!

00:12:22.792 --> 00:12:23.999
Push!

00:12:41.083 --> 00:12:43.167
- Run for it!
- Run!

00:12:49.167 --> 00:12:50.417
The safe!

00:12:52.334 --> 00:12:53.584
Hey, sis!

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:56.918
Over here!

00:13:00.876 --> 00:13:02.292
We win.

00:13:02.334 --> 00:13:04.375
Let's open our own
fried chicken shop...

00:13:04.417 --> 00:13:06.042
Those idiots...

00:13:06.083 --> 00:13:07.999
Hurry up, I'm hungry!

00:13:07.999 --> 00:13:09.500
Me too, come on.

00:13:10.918 --> 00:13:12.999
Don't forget the cleaning!
No backsies!

00:13:14.999 --> 00:13:18.375
Seriously, they wouldn't notice
if 5 million won went missing!

00:13:18.417 --> 00:13:21.000
You wanted chicken, right?
It's all we need.

00:13:22.876 --> 00:13:25.334
We could've opened
a whole fried chicken place.

00:13:25.375 --> 00:13:27.709
Instead, we can barely buy two...

00:13:28.584 --> 00:13:30.999
Are we seriously
leaving the money like that?

00:13:32.959 --> 00:13:34.167
Someone will come for it.

00:13:35.167 --> 00:13:36.125
Who?

00:13:41.626 --> 00:13:43.125
Let's go eat chicken.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.999
I was serious about
opening a chicken place...

00:13:45.999 --> 00:13:47.959
Chicken
Take-out Available

00:13:50.083 --> 00:13:53.042
Hey, there it is!
There comes our chicken!

00:13:56.876 --> 00:13:57.999
Wow, unbelievable.

00:13:57.999 --> 00:14:00.334
- Should we eat inside?
- Are you crazy?

00:14:00.375 --> 00:14:02.125
What if the old man catches us?

00:14:02.167 --> 00:14:05.000
We can just sit and eat
in the corner.

00:14:05.042 --> 00:14:06.999
No way! I'm starving,
let's just go home.

00:14:08.999 --> 00:14:09.999
Missed Call - Mister

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.042
- Crap, we're screwed.
- Why?

00:14:16.999 --> 00:14:18.250
It's the old man.

00:14:19.709 --> 00:14:20.918
We should go.

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:22.999
Let's hurry. Come on!

00:14:32.167 --> 00:14:34.999
Focus.
You're far from done.

00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:37.834
Don't drop your gun!

00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:41.000
Focus.

00:14:43.292 --> 00:14:44.667
Seok-su.

00:14:44.709 --> 00:14:47.250
You're useless, you hear?

00:14:47.709 --> 00:14:48.584
Dog shit.

00:14:48.626 --> 00:14:50.083
Eat this!

00:15:00.292 --> 00:15:01.292
So-mi.

00:15:06.792 --> 00:15:07.459
Joo-an.

00:15:09.999 --> 00:15:11.999
You crazy bastard!

00:15:13.667 --> 00:15:14.876
Ah-Hyeon.

00:15:27.999 --> 00:15:29.542
Whatever you guys do,

00:15:29.584 --> 00:15:30.999
I don't care at all.

00:15:31.999 --> 00:15:33.999
Breaking the law or going reckless,

00:15:34.667 --> 00:15:36.000
I don't care.

00:15:36.042 --> 00:15:37.792
There's only one thing
I care about.

00:15:40.417 --> 00:15:41.709
Unauthorized outing.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.959
If you want to die,
then leave.

00:15:46.375 --> 00:15:48.918
If you wish for any of us to die,

00:15:50.542 --> 00:15:51.709
go ahead.

00:16:07.999 --> 00:16:09.459
Mister...

00:16:10.375 --> 00:16:12.542
How long do we have to
live like this?

00:16:13.918 --> 00:16:16.375
Wouldn't it be better to just die?

00:16:16.417 --> 00:16:19.751
- So-mi!
- What? It's true.

00:16:20.999 --> 00:16:22.125
Am I wrong?

00:16:23.999 --> 00:16:26.834
We're stuck here forever.
Can't even go outside!

00:16:26.876 --> 00:16:29.792
No one looks for us.
We don't even have names!

00:16:29.834 --> 00:16:30.999
Stop it.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.417
Is this what you call living?

00:16:33.542 --> 00:16:36.999
Why... why do we have to
live like this?

00:16:36.999 --> 00:16:39.375
Isn't it better to just die instead?

00:16:39.417 --> 00:16:41.334
We didn't want to die!

00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:43.209
I don't want to die.

00:16:43.250 --> 00:16:45.584
Please save me, mister.

00:16:45.626 --> 00:16:47.250
I don't want to die...

00:16:48.999 --> 00:16:50.292
Please, save me...

00:16:50.334 --> 00:16:53.250
Please... Save me, please!

00:16:53.959 --> 00:16:57.250
I don't want to die.
Please save me.

00:16:58.459 --> 00:17:02.042
Because we all chose to live.

00:18:35.959 --> 00:18:37.999
We can't go on like this anymore.

00:18:38.542 --> 00:18:40.542
They won't last much longer.

00:18:42.667 --> 00:18:43.626
Ah-hyeon.

00:18:45.292 --> 00:18:46.500
I got us a boat.

00:18:47.459 --> 00:18:50.999
It's a small fishing boat,
so the journey will be rough.

00:18:51.709 --> 00:18:54.999
I want you to take care of them.

00:18:56.334 --> 00:18:57.626
What about you?

00:19:00.667 --> 00:19:01.918
Mister...

00:19:01.959 --> 00:19:03.250
I have something to do.

00:19:04.584 --> 00:19:05.959
When it's all done,

00:19:05.999 --> 00:19:08.876
I'll come right after you.

00:19:09.999 --> 00:19:12.375
Don't worry,
I'll be right behind.

00:19:12.999 --> 00:19:14.751
Can't we just go together?

00:19:16.584 --> 00:19:19.209
We can forget everything
and start fresh.

00:19:19.709 --> 00:19:21.876
What happens to those kids
isn't your fault.

00:19:22.918 --> 00:19:25.709
It's not something
you can handle alone.

00:19:26.209 --> 00:19:27.876
You'll get contacted soon.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.459
I can trust you, right?

00:19:33.999 --> 00:19:34.999
I'm sorry.

00:19:35.459 --> 00:19:37.792
I feel like
I'm asking too much of you.

00:19:39.209 --> 00:19:42.292
I'll talk to the kids separately.

00:19:53.626 --> 00:19:54.999
Yeah, let's go.

00:19:55.292 --> 00:19:57.709
I'll bring plenty of cash today.

00:19:57.751 --> 00:19:59.959
Let's win a fortune.

00:19:59.999 --> 00:20:02.083
Alright, man.
See you later.

00:20:05.042 --> 00:20:08.876
Hey, why do you keep sweeping?
No one's coming.

00:20:09.999 --> 00:20:11.500
Just keeping myself busy.

00:20:11.542 --> 00:20:15.542
I understand.
Things have been slow lately.

00:20:16.083 --> 00:20:17.542
Too slow, in fact.

00:20:17.584 --> 00:20:19.876
We're running out of money.

00:20:19.918 --> 00:20:23.667
No refund customers these days...

00:20:24.751 --> 00:20:28.209
Boss, what if
we expand our operation?

00:20:29.417 --> 00:20:31.999
Won't there be
much more work that way?

00:20:32.542 --> 00:20:33.792
Like what?

00:20:33.834 --> 00:20:35.292
Something like sales...

00:20:35.918 --> 00:20:38.584
It may be more profitable.

00:20:38.999 --> 00:20:43.250
Actually, I tried begging
Director Jeong for work.

00:20:43.667 --> 00:20:44.834
Didn't work.

00:20:45.667 --> 00:20:47.584
Only got cursed at.

00:20:47.626 --> 00:20:51.626
Can't we bypass Director Jeong
and contact the higher-ups?

00:20:51.667 --> 00:20:53.250
You think that's possible?

00:20:54.709 --> 00:20:55.999
Why not?

00:21:04.626 --> 00:21:08.459
Do you know who's at the very top?

00:21:09.792 --> 00:21:13.417
Who?
Have you actually seen him?

00:21:14.999 --> 00:21:15.999
The Lord.

00:21:18.125 --> 00:21:21.167
The Lord is up above.

00:21:21.834 --> 00:21:23.709
He's not in this world,
but he's there.

00:21:23.751 --> 00:21:26.042
Can't be seen,
but he exists.

00:21:28.876 --> 00:21:33.999
♪ Sorry sorry
♪ Sorry sorry

00:21:36.542 --> 00:21:38.751
Thank you so much every time, Doctor.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.792
Don't be.
I do it because I enjoy it.

00:21:41.834 --> 00:21:43.834
You know how much I love kids.

00:21:44.999 --> 00:21:46.667
The director is here!

00:21:46.709 --> 00:21:48.959
Come quickly!

00:21:51.999 --> 00:21:54.999
- Shall we start with a prayer?
- Yes.

00:21:54.999 --> 00:21:59.751
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

00:21:59.792 --> 00:22:04.999
Lord, bless this food you have
graciously given us and bless us.

00:22:04.999 --> 00:22:08.999
Through our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen!

00:22:08.999 --> 00:22:12.375
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit.

00:22:12.417 --> 00:22:13.709
Amen.

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.667
Enjoy the food!

00:22:17.709 --> 00:22:18.999
Looks delicious, right?

00:22:21.083 --> 00:22:23.876
Doctor, you're like my mom.

00:22:24.459 --> 00:22:25.417
Really?

00:22:26.876 --> 00:22:28.751
Then call me 'Mom', okay?

00:22:29.959 --> 00:22:30.999
Mom!

00:22:36.584 --> 00:22:38.042
Help me!

00:22:38.876 --> 00:22:40.999
I'm in here!

00:22:42.167 --> 00:22:43.667
Help me!

00:22:45.709 --> 00:22:47.751
I'm in here!

00:22:51.209 --> 00:22:52.417
Who are you?

00:22:53.792 --> 00:22:54.999
Untie me!

00:22:56.999 --> 00:23:00.125
The Reality of Upper-Class Newborn Trade

00:23:01.626 --> 00:23:02.918
Please...

00:23:03.918 --> 00:23:07.250
I'll make it all go away, really!

00:23:07.292 --> 00:23:09.959
How can you make it
go away, Mr. Reporter?

00:23:12.334 --> 00:23:13.999
You found out...

00:23:15.083 --> 00:23:16.626
...about everything.

00:23:16.999 --> 00:23:18.500
No, no!

00:23:19.417 --> 00:23:22.792
I don't know anything.
Nothing at all!

00:23:23.292 --> 00:23:24.584
Please...

00:23:25.083 --> 00:23:26.999
I have a 7-year-old son,

00:23:27.667 --> 00:23:29.709
and a pregnant wife.

00:23:29.999 --> 00:23:31.999
Please, I beg you.

00:23:32.417 --> 00:23:33.918
Good for them.

00:23:35.834 --> 00:23:36.876
Whole Life Insurance

00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:38.751
They'll receive about 3 billion won
in insurance.

00:23:39.167 --> 00:23:40.999
Your wife will be happy.

00:23:42.334 --> 00:23:43.500
Uh...

00:23:44.792 --> 00:23:48.250
An impossible amount
with a reporter's salary.

00:23:48.292 --> 00:23:49.375
No, no, no.

00:23:49.417 --> 00:23:51.584
She doesn't need this.

00:23:51.626 --> 00:23:53.999
Please... save me!

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.999
She doesn't need this!
Please!

00:24:07.417 --> 00:24:08.959
It's done.

00:24:09.709 --> 00:24:11.667
I don't want to live anymore.
I'm sorry.

00:24:11.709 --> 00:24:13.999
Show love to the children.

00:24:14.709 --> 00:24:17.918
Let them know through your eyes.

00:24:18.209 --> 00:24:22.083
Children who are loved
return it twofold.

00:24:23.709 --> 00:24:24.999
Are you watching this again?

00:24:26.167 --> 00:24:27.999
I love you, my girl.

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.459
Why do you watch this?
It's gross.

00:24:31.209 --> 00:24:32.167
Because it's fun.

00:24:32.209 --> 00:24:34.417
Let's all do it together.

00:24:34.459 --> 00:24:36.792
I love you, my girl.

00:24:36.999 --> 00:24:39.500
Mommy loves you.

00:24:40.417 --> 00:24:42.626
I love you, my girl.

00:24:42.667 --> 00:24:44.959
- Daddy loves you.
- Mommy loves you.

00:24:47.459 --> 00:24:48.417
Good job.

00:26:37.584 --> 00:26:39.834
This can't be...

00:26:39.876 --> 00:26:42.918
Unfortunately, Si-woo doesn't meet

00:26:42.959 --> 00:26:45.250
the requirements for
the Mensa math class.

00:26:45.292 --> 00:26:48.792
There must be an error in the test.

00:26:49.709 --> 00:26:51.083
We'll try again.

00:26:52.417 --> 00:26:54.125
You know, right?

00:26:54.167 --> 00:26:57.209
Si-woo's dad graduated
from Stanford Medical School.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:26:59.083
For Si-woo to walk his path,

00:26:59.709 --> 00:27:02.792
he must take the Mensa math class.

00:27:04.626 --> 00:27:07.167
All the kids here have already joined.

00:27:07.209 --> 00:27:08.999
We'll take it again.

00:27:08.999 --> 00:27:11.626
The results will likely be the same.

00:27:11.667 --> 00:27:12.999
For God's sake!

00:27:14.792 --> 00:27:16.042
There's no way.

00:27:17.584 --> 00:27:20.417
They said Si-woo
had high intelligence...

00:27:22.959 --> 00:27:23.999
Mom!

00:27:27.584 --> 00:27:28.584
Mom!

00:27:29.626 --> 00:27:32.999
I finished early.
Can I skip tuition and go play?

00:27:34.334 --> 00:27:35.125
What did you say?

00:27:36.125 --> 00:27:37.167
Please?

00:27:40.999 --> 00:27:42.876
Are you serious?

00:27:42.918 --> 00:27:44.667
Mom, please?

00:27:47.083 --> 00:27:48.584
You're laughing again.

00:27:56.083 --> 00:27:58.459
Alright, let's go.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:00.209
You're the best, Mom!

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.125
Hello?

00:28:16.167 --> 00:28:17.834
Is this Dr. Kim Se-hee?

00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.709
Yes, who's speaking?

00:28:20.751 --> 00:28:22.834
The lady requests to meet you.

00:28:26.751 --> 00:28:29.999
I've been waiting
so long for your call.

00:28:29.999 --> 00:28:32.626
There are a few things
to keep in mind...

00:28:32.667 --> 00:28:35.999
Sorry, but I'm driving right now.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.999
There's a child with me too.

00:28:37.999 --> 00:28:39.999
I'll call you back soon.

00:28:39.999 --> 00:28:41.125
Excuse me?

00:28:43.626 --> 00:28:46.792
Did I disturb your studies?
Sorry.

00:28:46.834 --> 00:28:48.792
No, I'm fine.

00:28:49.626 --> 00:28:50.918
What a kind girl.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.918
By the way, tell me about Si-woo.
He seems fun.

00:28:56.792 --> 00:29:00.542
Si-woo is very popular
and fun at school.

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:03.584
He's one of my closest friends.

00:29:03.999 --> 00:29:06.584
He's going to the kids' park
with his mom today.

00:29:06.999 --> 00:29:09.999
Really?
Si-woo's very lucky.

00:29:16.459 --> 00:29:17.542
What are you doing?

00:29:17.584 --> 00:29:19.834
Huh?
You got here fast.

00:29:19.876 --> 00:29:22.542
I was doing something nearby.
What's this?

00:29:22.584 --> 00:29:24.584
An emergency disposal.

00:29:24.626 --> 00:29:26.209
I just went and got it myself.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.959
It's damn heavy.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.459
Anyway, I've got a game tonight.

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.999
You can handle this alone, right?

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.834
Sure, it's not like
it's my first time.

00:29:34.876 --> 00:29:38.417
And this is a refund request
that came in.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.250
I want a refund.
The kid isn't 19 yet.

00:29:44.292 --> 00:29:46.459
Yes, ma'am.
Of course.

00:29:46.876 --> 00:29:49.542
Can I confirm a few things first?

00:29:49.584 --> 00:29:50.999
Go ahead.

00:29:50.999 --> 00:29:52.999
You're Park Min-joo, right?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.999
And your husband is Choi Hyun-gyu...

00:29:54.999 --> 00:29:56.999
Yes, that's right.

00:29:56.999 --> 00:29:58.918
Let's get this over with.

00:29:58.959 --> 00:30:00.918
He's nothing but a defect.

00:30:01.042 --> 00:30:04.000
I mean,
how can a kid be so stupid?

00:30:04.042 --> 00:30:06.083
I want a refund fast!

00:30:06.125 --> 00:30:09.626
And some compensation for the error!

00:30:09.667 --> 00:30:10.959
Ma'am...

00:30:10.999 --> 00:30:12.626
Our customer sounds upset.

00:30:12.667 --> 00:30:14.999
Ugh, disgusting people...

00:30:14.999 --> 00:30:15.999
Seriously...

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.999
Even dogs aren't abandoned like this!

00:30:19.999 --> 00:30:20.999
Alright, give me a hand.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.792
One, two...

00:30:35.125 --> 00:30:36.167
Hello?

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.167
Yes, take care of him well.

00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:45.459
With no loose ends.

00:30:45.999 --> 00:30:47.083
Okay.

00:30:47.959 --> 00:30:48.918
Si-woo,

00:30:48.959 --> 00:30:51.334
I'll get some coke.
Wait here, okay?

00:30:51.375 --> 00:30:52.500
Okay.

00:30:53.417 --> 00:30:54.876
See you in a bit.

00:31:02.167 --> 00:31:03.500
What do you mean?

00:31:03.542 --> 00:31:05.292
Why did his level test
come out like that?

00:31:05.334 --> 00:31:06.751
I don't know.

00:31:06.792 --> 00:31:08.999
He was a defect.

00:31:08.999 --> 00:31:10.999
I'm seriously annoyed, honey.

00:31:11.417 --> 00:31:14.834
Still, how could you make
that decision alone?

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.250
It's a big deal!

00:31:16.292 --> 00:31:18.459
Why do you always do
whatever you want?

00:31:18.834 --> 00:31:23.999
And when has doing it your way
ever worked out? Huh?

00:31:23.999 --> 00:31:25.876
You're unbelievable...

00:31:25.918 --> 00:31:29.125
Why did you even bother adopting
in the first place?

00:31:30.999 --> 00:31:33.375
Your mom was all crazy
about having grandkids,

00:31:33.417 --> 00:31:35.000
despite her son being infertile.

00:31:35.626 --> 00:31:37.959
She would've blamed me again.

00:31:38.584 --> 00:31:41.417
You talk like a frickin' villager.

00:31:41.626 --> 00:31:42.918
So what now?

00:31:42.959 --> 00:31:46.417
What if things go south
because of the refund?

00:31:46.459 --> 00:31:48.834
We can just say he went missing.

00:31:48.876 --> 00:31:52.792
And they'll take care of the disposal.
We have to trust them.

00:31:52.834 --> 00:31:56.334
Honestly, he smiles like a weak fool!

00:31:56.375 --> 00:31:58.667
Like an idiot.
Don't you think so?

00:31:58.709 --> 00:32:01.876
Yeah, he didn't look like a kid
with the brains.

00:32:01.999 --> 00:32:03.292
Exactly!

00:32:03.334 --> 00:32:06.167
But still, you raised him
like he was your own.

00:32:06.209 --> 00:32:07.500
Do you have no sympathy?

00:32:07.542 --> 00:32:08.876
Sympathy my butt.

00:32:08.918 --> 00:32:10.876
We don't share a drop of blood.

00:32:11.999 --> 00:32:13.999
What a waste.

00:32:13.999 --> 00:32:16.125
I spent way too much money on him.

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:17.167
Mom?

00:32:17.999 --> 00:32:19.083
Mom...

00:32:19.792 --> 00:32:20.751
Mom!

00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:25.292
What am I going to tell my mother?

00:32:25.334 --> 00:32:27.542
I'm going to adopt a new one.

00:32:27.584 --> 00:32:30.542
We're getting a full refund,
so we'll just use that.

00:32:33.999 --> 00:32:35.626
Honey, I've gotta go now.

00:32:35.667 --> 00:32:39.167
Oh! You have to come and cry too.
To make it look real.

00:32:40.375 --> 00:32:41.417
Bye now.

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:43.375
Hello? Hello?

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:47.709
Why do they need me as well?

00:32:47.751 --> 00:32:49.292
Jeez...

00:33:00.999 --> 00:33:01.999
Mom!

00:33:03.334 --> 00:33:04.999
Mom, where are you?

00:33:13.999 --> 00:33:15.209
You're Si-woo, right?

00:33:18.375 --> 00:33:21.792
Your mom got hurt just now.

00:33:21.834 --> 00:33:22.959
She's at the hospital.

00:33:22.999 --> 00:33:23.999
What?

00:33:24.584 --> 00:33:26.083
She asked me to come get you.

00:33:28.375 --> 00:33:29.667
Let's go.

00:33:35.209 --> 00:33:38.125
Excuse me...

00:33:38.167 --> 00:33:39.167
Please...

00:33:39.209 --> 00:33:40.209
What's going on?

00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:41.459
Help me...

00:33:42.751 --> 00:33:45.167
My son is missing.

00:33:45.209 --> 00:33:47.375
- Calm down.
- Please, find my child.

00:33:47.417 --> 00:33:49.834
Ma'am, calm down.
Where did you last see him?

00:33:49.876 --> 00:33:53.042
He was playing just over there.

00:33:53.083 --> 00:33:55.999
And we were supposed
to meet right here.

00:33:55.999 --> 00:33:57.999
But he disappeared!

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.167
Okay, what's his name and age?

00:34:01.209 --> 00:34:03.999
Choi Si-woo, he's 11.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.292
- It's a boy?
- Yes...

00:34:06.334 --> 00:34:08.292
Si-woo, my baby...

00:34:10.334 --> 00:34:12.584
Ma'am, Ma'am, Ma'am!

00:34:12.626 --> 00:34:14.792
- He must be so hungry...
- Calm down.

00:34:14.834 --> 00:34:15.999
The report has been filed.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.918
He said he wanted coke,
so I went to buy it...

00:34:18.959 --> 00:34:20.709
Please stay calm
and wait a little longer...

00:34:20.751 --> 00:34:21.751
Si-woo!

00:34:21.792 --> 00:34:23.042
Ma'am! Ma'am!

00:34:24.042 --> 00:34:26.209
- Where is he?
- Ma'am, wait!

00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:28.918
We have to find him!

00:34:28.959 --> 00:34:33.083
- Honey, our boy!
- Tell me what happened.

00:34:33.125 --> 00:34:36.542
- Did you find Si-woo?
- No, not yet.

00:34:36.584 --> 00:34:39.292
We're looking for him
at this very moment.

00:34:39.334 --> 00:34:41.375
My poor Si-woo!

00:34:41.417 --> 00:34:43.999
He must be starving...

00:34:44.709 --> 00:34:45.999
Honey...

00:34:46.542 --> 00:34:48.000
- Are you okay?
- Honey, please...

00:34:48.042 --> 00:34:50.709
I can't live without Si-woo!

00:34:50.751 --> 00:34:53.167
- What do we do?
- Si-woo...

00:34:53.209 --> 00:34:55.999
Please, find him.

00:35:19.125 --> 00:35:21.167
Si-woo... Choi Si-woo!

00:35:21.999 --> 00:35:23.209
Wake up.

00:35:24.417 --> 00:35:25.375
Can you hear me?

00:35:26.083 --> 00:35:27.667
Who are you?

00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.709
Where am I?

00:35:30.334 --> 00:35:31.792
Si-woo, just wait.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:33.999
Boss

00:35:34.542 --> 00:35:35.542
Wait a moment.

00:35:36.709 --> 00:35:37.959
Yes, boss.

00:35:37.999 --> 00:35:39.876
Hey, where are you?

00:35:39.999 --> 00:35:41.500
Almost there.

00:35:41.542 --> 00:35:43.584
I totally got busted today gambling.

00:35:43.626 --> 00:35:44.999
Darn it.

00:35:44.999 --> 00:35:45.999
I'll be there soon.

00:35:45.999 --> 00:35:47.125
What?

00:35:47.876 --> 00:35:49.709
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

00:35:49.999 --> 00:35:52.792
It's okay.
Go home and rest.

00:35:52.834 --> 00:35:54.459
I'll finish things up here.

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.417
I've got nothing to do
at home anyway.

00:35:56.459 --> 00:35:57.792
Let's grab a drink after.

00:35:58.667 --> 00:36:01.292
Yes, okay. Got it.

00:36:02.751 --> 00:36:03.876
Mister...

00:36:04.292 --> 00:36:07.792
Where are we?
Who are you?

00:36:08.792 --> 00:36:10.000
Where's my mom?

00:36:10.042 --> 00:36:12.125
Listen carefully, Si-woo.

00:36:12.167 --> 00:36:13.959
You've been kidnapped.

00:36:13.999 --> 00:36:15.999
And the people who ordered
your kidnap...

00:36:15.999 --> 00:36:19.042
...are your parents,
Park Min-joo and Choi Hyun-gyu.

00:36:23.542 --> 00:36:24.959
Yes, hello?

00:36:24.999 --> 00:36:26.334
I've confirmed the location.

00:36:26.999 --> 00:36:28.959
Leave the child for a while.

00:36:29.167 --> 00:36:32.292
Then ask a staff member for help
an hour later.

00:36:32.334 --> 00:36:33.584
Wait, what?

00:36:37.417 --> 00:36:38.999
You want me to put on a show?

00:36:39.792 --> 00:36:42.709
Yes, report it to the police as well.

00:36:42.751 --> 00:36:44.876
I'll lure the child to
a security camera blind spot,

00:36:44.918 --> 00:36:46.667
and take him to the parking lot.

00:36:46.709 --> 00:36:48.876
I'll be there in 30 minutes.

00:36:49.334 --> 00:36:51.292
About the refund...

00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:55.375
And your mom and dad
told me to kill you.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.125
Don't kill me!
Please save me!

00:36:59.667 --> 00:37:01.626
I'm really sorry!

00:37:01.667 --> 00:37:02.959
No, no, Si-woo.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:05.999
I'm going to save you.

00:37:06.292 --> 00:37:08.042
So if you want to live,

00:37:08.083 --> 00:37:11.375
you have to trust everything
I say from now on.

00:37:11.417 --> 00:37:12.626
Can you do that?

00:37:15.375 --> 00:37:17.083
Choi Hyun-gyu and Park Min-joo...

00:37:19.125 --> 00:37:21.125
They never saw you as their child.

00:37:21.167 --> 00:37:24.792
That's not true!
My mom and dad aren't like that!

00:37:24.999 --> 00:37:26.083
Mister, I want to get out.

00:37:26.125 --> 00:37:28.459
No, Si-woo.
You can't go out right now.

00:37:28.999 --> 00:37:31.999
You have to trust me,
can you do that?

00:37:34.834 --> 00:37:36.876
Here, take this.

00:37:37.209 --> 00:37:38.375
Go here.

00:37:38.999 --> 00:37:41.751
There will be kids like you
waiting for you.

00:37:42.751 --> 00:37:44.959
Don't let anyone see you
on the way.

00:38:23.751 --> 00:38:25.083
It's hard to believe, but...

00:38:26.083 --> 00:38:29.959
Your parents are bad people
who buy children with money.

00:38:30.292 --> 00:38:34.209
And if they don't like 'em,
they just trash them.

00:38:42.999 --> 00:38:45.417
If they find out you're still alive...

00:38:45.459 --> 00:38:46.999
What if I just try harder?

00:38:47.876 --> 00:38:49.999
I'll become a better son.

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.999
I'm sorry, mister.

00:38:53.459 --> 00:38:57.250
Please, just let me call
my mom once.

00:38:58.876 --> 00:39:03.667
I'll tell her I'll do better,
that I'm sorry.

00:39:09.417 --> 00:39:12.626
Bathhouse

00:39:23.167 --> 00:39:25.042
A new child will arrive soon.

00:39:25.834 --> 00:39:27.667
Take good care of him, Ah-hyeon.

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:38.083
Okay. Be careful.

00:39:57.999 --> 00:39:58.999
Si-woo...

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:03.876
People who throw away their child
for being 'not good enough'...

00:40:04.792 --> 00:40:06.918
...aren't worthy of being parents.

00:40:15.542 --> 00:40:19.417
You know, I was the one
who made the big decision.

00:40:19.999 --> 00:40:22.999
You usually don't make big decisions.

00:40:22.999 --> 00:40:25.375
He smiled at me and said,

00:40:25.417 --> 00:40:29.125
Hehe, Mom...,
you know?

00:40:29.542 --> 00:40:32.292
Yeah, yeah.
Grinning all stupid.

00:40:32.334 --> 00:40:37.042
At that moment, I realized
I couldn't take him anymore.

00:40:37.083 --> 00:40:38.999
I was done with him.

00:40:39.959 --> 00:40:43.999
Seriously, I even hated
the sound of him walking.

00:40:48.459 --> 00:40:50.042
Honestly, you're something else.

00:40:50.083 --> 00:40:53.751
You'd have done the same.
Try being stuck with him 24/7.

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:55.500
Hold on.

00:40:56.584 --> 00:40:57.792
Hello?

00:40:58.584 --> 00:41:01.542
You're supposed to be sad,
remember?

00:41:04.083 --> 00:41:05.417
Hello?

00:41:08.125 --> 00:41:09.751
Hello?

00:41:11.709 --> 00:41:13.375
Who is it?

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:19.999
Mom...

00:41:23.999 --> 00:41:25.209
Are you...

00:41:26.751 --> 00:41:27.999
Are you Si-woo?

00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:30.584
Impossible, stop fooling around.

00:41:30.876 --> 00:41:33.999
Mom!
Mom, I'm sorry!

00:41:35.626 --> 00:41:36.792
What the hell?

00:41:37.167 --> 00:41:39.125
- What is it?
- What do we do?

00:41:40.751 --> 00:41:42.459
It's him on the phone.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.999
- Who?
- It's his voice...

00:41:45.999 --> 00:41:48.334
I think he's not dead!

00:41:49.334 --> 00:41:51.876
What? Hang up!

00:41:51.918 --> 00:41:53.459
He can't be alive!

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.999
See for yourself.

00:41:56.584 --> 00:41:57.709
Hello?

00:41:58.167 --> 00:41:59.999
We processed the refund, right?

00:41:59.999 --> 00:42:02.125
Then he's supposed to be dead.

00:42:02.167 --> 00:42:03.667
Hello?

00:42:07.209 --> 00:42:09.876
Mom!

00:42:11.125 --> 00:42:13.834
Mom!

00:42:18.751 --> 00:42:21.209
Mom!

00:43:06.167 --> 00:43:08.042
Die! Die! Die!

00:43:16.999 --> 00:43:18.876
It's time to go.

00:44:02.417 --> 00:44:03.667
Choi Si-woo is alive.

00:44:18.334 --> 00:44:19.751
Yes, Director Jeong.

00:44:19.792 --> 00:44:21.000
Where's Choi Si-woo?

00:44:21.042 --> 00:44:22.042
Excuse me?

00:44:22.626 --> 00:44:24.250
If you don't find the damn kid,

00:44:24.999 --> 00:44:25.999
you're dead.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.042
What do you mean...?

00:44:27.584 --> 00:44:28.751
Wait, hello?

00:44:32.876 --> 00:44:35.999
Tae-sik, I think we're screwed.
Don't tell me...

00:44:40.999 --> 00:44:44.292
Bathhouse

00:44:56.709 --> 00:44:57.626
Who's that?

00:44:57.667 --> 00:44:59.250
Is he like a five-year-old?

00:45:02.751 --> 00:45:04.834
It must be a mistake, right?

00:45:05.083 --> 00:45:06.334
He's really small.

00:45:17.667 --> 00:45:18.918
Welcome.

00:45:27.125 --> 00:45:28.125
Tae-sik!

00:45:29.167 --> 00:45:30.375
Woo Tae-sik!

00:45:31.375 --> 00:45:32.334
Woo Tae-sik!

00:45:33.125 --> 00:45:34.334
You're early.

00:45:35.584 --> 00:45:37.125
- Is he here?
- What?

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:39.000
- He's here...
- What's going on?

00:45:39.042 --> 00:45:43.000
He said the kid was gone.
I thought we were done for.

00:45:44.167 --> 00:45:47.751
Why is he on my ass all the time?

00:45:47.999 --> 00:45:48.959
Jackass...

00:45:55.584 --> 00:45:56.751
Director Jeong!

00:45:56.792 --> 00:45:57.999
The kid's here!

00:46:02.999 --> 00:46:05.709
What's going on?
I said the kid's here!

00:46:06.292 --> 00:46:07.999
Fuck you...!

00:46:13.999 --> 00:46:15.042
Open it.

00:46:16.542 --> 00:46:18.584
- What's going on?
- Take him out.

00:46:23.751 --> 00:46:25.709
Have you ever looked into
their eyes?

00:46:25.751 --> 00:46:26.999
The kids that died here...

00:46:27.667 --> 00:46:30.250
You could see hell through their eyes.

00:47:36.626 --> 00:47:37.999
Aren't you going to blow it?

00:47:47.417 --> 00:47:48.792
Hey, kid.

00:47:48.999 --> 00:47:50.626
Listen carefully.

00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:53.209
The day you arrive here
is your new birthday.

00:47:53.918 --> 00:47:55.334
Congrats.
You're born again.

00:47:55.375 --> 00:47:57.834
I'm impressed
he made it here by himself.

00:48:02.334 --> 00:48:03.626
Here.

00:48:21.334 --> 00:48:23.042
So what's your name?

00:48:23.083 --> 00:48:25.209
Why would you ask that?

00:48:25.667 --> 00:48:27.751
Give yourself a new name, okay?

00:48:28.584 --> 00:48:32.042
We didn't like the names they gave us,
so we made our own.

00:48:33.167 --> 00:48:35.876
Their names are
after subway stations.

00:48:36.334 --> 00:48:39.334
Ah-hyeon Station, Seok-su Station,
and Joo-an Station.

00:48:40.542 --> 00:48:41.500
Funny, right?

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.999
She has a K-pop idol's name.
So-mi!

00:48:45.999 --> 00:48:47.834
Is she Jeon So-mi, or what?

00:48:47.876 --> 00:48:49.459
She's out of her mind.

00:48:53.167 --> 00:48:54.250
Not funny?

00:48:54.999 --> 00:48:55.999
Guess not...

00:48:57.459 --> 00:49:00.042
Mister, call me back...

00:49:01.459 --> 00:49:03.209
I'm hungry.

00:49:04.417 --> 00:49:05.959
When is the old man coming?

00:49:06.083 --> 00:49:07.999
He said he'd buy us chicken today.

00:49:07.999 --> 00:49:09.167
Yeah...

00:49:09.209 --> 00:49:11.999
Hey, why didn't you come
with the old man?

00:49:13.959 --> 00:49:17.042
Bluebird one, searching around
the payphone area.

00:49:20.459 --> 00:49:22.125
Ah-hyeon, what's that car?

00:49:29.792 --> 00:49:32.125
Searching near the payphone.

00:49:33.209 --> 00:49:35.626
We're looking for an eleven-year-old boy,

00:49:36.751 --> 00:49:39.292
last seen with a blue shirt
and beige pants.

00:49:39.334 --> 00:49:41.834
Looking for a eleven-year-old boy...

00:49:41.876 --> 00:49:44.167
Police frequency,
but they're not using code words.

00:49:44.209 --> 00:49:45.751
What the hell?

00:49:46.125 --> 00:49:48.999
Hey, did you meet anyone
on the way here?

00:49:50.667 --> 00:49:53.459
Or... did someone see you?

00:49:54.584 --> 00:49:56.999
Maybe you called the police?

00:49:59.667 --> 00:50:02.626
I called my Mom.

00:50:04.999 --> 00:50:05.999
Mister...

00:50:48.709 --> 00:50:50.250
- Get closer to him!
- Shoot!

00:53:22.999 --> 00:53:24.292
Mister...

00:53:26.999 --> 00:53:28.542
Mister!

00:53:34.375 --> 00:53:38.125
The Defects
Epilogue

00:53:55.751 --> 00:53:57.751
Kim Ah-hyeon

00:53:59.751 --> 00:54:02.999
Kim Ah-hyeon

00:54:05.375 --> 00:54:06.999
Kim Ah-hyeon

00:54:10.167 --> 00:54:11.417
Is your name...

00:54:11.999 --> 00:54:13.083
Kim Ah-hyeon?

00:54:25.375 --> 00:54:27.918
Bathhouse

00:54:29.999 --> 00:54:31.334
Is this our home?

00:54:32.292 --> 00:54:33.334
Well...

00:54:34.709 --> 00:54:36.542
Not exactly.

00:54:37.667 --> 00:54:39.083
It's home.

00:54:39.751 --> 00:54:41.000
Let's go inside.

00:54:43.542 --> 00:54:44.709
Yeah.

00:54:47.999 --> 00:54:49.999
Kim Ah-hyeon

00:55:22.334 --> 00:55:23.375
Help yourselves.

00:55:26.167 --> 00:55:28.334
Where's the chicken leg?
Did you eat it?

00:55:28.375 --> 00:55:29.999
- No, I didn't!
- Yes, you did!

00:55:29.999 --> 00:55:31.167
Who ate the chicken leg?

00:55:31.209 --> 00:55:32.999
- The legs are gone!
- Pass me a piece!

00:55:32.999 --> 00:55:35.334
You can have this.

00:55:35.375 --> 00:55:36.542
Don't fight.

00:55:36.584 --> 00:55:38.459
- I wish we ate chicken more often.
- Me too.

00:55:38.500 --> 00:55:40.292
I'm sick of eating ramen every day.

00:55:40.334 --> 00:55:42.167
It's better to have it
once in a while.

00:55:42.209 --> 00:55:45.083
Mister, let's take a picture together!

00:55:45.125 --> 00:55:46.417
Should I take it?

00:55:46.459 --> 00:55:48.250
Who takes pictures while eating?

00:55:48.292 --> 00:55:50.209
Come on, it's been a while.

00:55:52.042 --> 00:55:53.125
Gosh...

00:55:54.417 --> 00:55:55.751
Leave me out of it.

00:55:55.792 --> 00:55:57.209
- I'm taking it.
- No, don't!

00:55:57.250 --> 00:55:58.500
Just pose!

00:55:58.542 --> 00:56:00.500
One, two, three!

00:56:00.999 --> 00:56:03.042
One, two, three!

00:56:31.918 --> 00:56:34.042
Thank you to actor Kim Soo-ro
for the special appearance.

00:56:34.083 --> 00:56:37.042
The Defects

00:56:37.999 --> 00:56:39.999
Nice to meet you, Madam Lady.

00:56:39.999 --> 00:56:42.709
I want to give him
a child worthy of him.

00:56:42.751 --> 00:56:44.792
There's always a way.

00:56:44.834 --> 00:56:46.709
You know, I'm so happy today.

00:56:46.751 --> 00:56:49.292
I feel like my dream
is about to come true.

00:56:49.999 --> 00:56:50.918
My best friend from class...

00:56:50.959 --> 00:56:52.542
He hasn't been coming to school.

00:56:52.584 --> 00:56:53.959
He should be fine, right?

00:56:53.999 --> 00:56:55.125
We were just products to them.

00:56:55.167 --> 00:56:56.667
Something they bought,

00:56:56.709 --> 00:56:58.334
that may be disposed of whenever.

00:56:58.375 --> 00:57:00.167
Where's the membership card?

00:57:00.209 --> 00:57:02.334
Those kids shouldn't even exist.

00:57:02.375 --> 00:57:04.125
Where would they go?

00:57:04.167 --> 00:57:05.542
To a place where no one exists.

00:57:06.334 --> 00:57:07.209
Hurry!

00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:08.918
You're all defective products.

00:57:08.959 --> 00:57:10.959
...trying so hard to kill us.

00:57:10.999 --> 00:57:12.167
The one our old man
couldn't find...

00:57:12.209 --> 00:57:14.083
The monster.
I'm gonna find him.
