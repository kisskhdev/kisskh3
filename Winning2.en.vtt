WEBVTT

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.960
THE WINNING TRY

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.175
What?

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:55.972
HANYANG HIGH

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:13.531
The pig's nose is a rugby ball.

00:01:23.958 --> 00:01:25.210
Ju Ga-ram!

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.090
Vice Principal.

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:32.926
Here's a towel.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:34.969
EPISODE 2

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:39.390
What in the world is this?

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:54.114
Don't you know the importance
of the first opening rite of the semester?

00:01:54.906 --> 00:01:56.199
Why would you do this?

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:58.034
Why!

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:02.330
I did it because the Rugby Team
was left out of such a meaningful rite.

00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:03.706
This is…

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.126
- I'm sorry.
- That really hurt.

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.794
I'm so sorry.

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:09.420
We can't let this slide.

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:12.924
What will you do about the mental toll
it has caused the students?

00:02:13.007 --> 00:02:16.636
These students even wear yellow underwear
in hopes of winning a gold medal.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.888
- And you knock over the rite?
- Technically,

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:21.099
I threw the ball and hit a bullseye.

00:02:22.016 --> 00:02:24.144
Is he serious? What should I do with him?

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:25.395
Gosh.

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:28.940
Do you even know how much money
my team's sponsor paid for that rite?

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.359
How dare he botch it up!

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:33.820
Hold on.

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.490
What are you going to do?

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:41.369
The school is at fault
for leaving out the rugby ball.

00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:45.832
But that doesn't mean
we can just overlook ruining the rite.

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:48.668
I'll come up with
an appropriate course of action.

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:49.586
No.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.463
Let's vote on his dismissal first.

00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:00.930
If the dismissal goes through,
we won't need to take any further action.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:04.100
He'll be leaving anyway.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:13.234
THE WINNING TRY

00:03:15.778 --> 00:03:17.113
How did he hit a bullseye?

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:18.615
- That's crazy.
- Wicked.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.910
Did you see the angle of his throw?
He still has it.

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:24.537
Honestly, isn't he better than the coach
who left us?

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.499
- Hello.
- Captain.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:31.961
As if.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:34.380
Come on, just be honest with me.

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:36.507
You thought that was well deserved, right?

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:40.845
- Hey.
- What?

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.764
Do you think that did us any good?

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.934
Ju-yang, you know I never fight.

00:03:46.017 --> 00:03:47.560
But he always comes at me.

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.812
That's because you always spew nonsense.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:51.564
You and your sharp tongue.

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:53.691
What are you studying today?

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:58.321
I can keep going if you don't put it down.

00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:01.574
Keep fighting. We can't train
without a coach anyway.

00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:02.867
I'm up for community service.

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:06.120
I'm sorry,
but I need a good school report.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.040
You can face the punishment alone.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.876
Are you still going to vote yes?

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:13.878
You're going to vote yes?

00:04:13.962 --> 00:04:15.713
We can't play without a coach.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:18.299
They'll bring in a new coach.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.218
Really? Someone better than Ju Ga-ram?

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:24.305
I mean, he was a great starter
back in his days.

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:28.643
- So?
- What?

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:33.147
I need a coach who can help us
get into colleges and pro teams,

00:04:33.231 --> 00:04:35.608
not a juicer who's been expelled
from the union.

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:41.990
Ga-ram. What are you going to do now?

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:48.746
- You're not quitting, are you?
- As you know, I don't have much decency.

00:04:54.585 --> 00:04:57.880
"Rugby Team's Training Schedule"?
Why are you giving this to me?

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:01.217
I'm suspended from coaching
until the voting, aren't I?

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.218
So?

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.470
"Miss training for one day,
and your body knows it."

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.597
"Two days, the coach knows it."

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:09.767
"Three days, and the opponent knows it."

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.269
It's a famous sports quote.

00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:12.770
So what?

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:15.189
Please train the kids for me.

00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:22.363
One, two, three, four,

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.907
five, six, seven, eight.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.285
Two, two, three, four,

00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:28.661
- five, six…
- Keep your hand up!

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:30.705
One, two, three, four,

00:05:30.788 --> 00:05:33.291
five, six, seven, eight.

00:05:33.374 --> 00:05:35.460
Two, two, three, four,

00:05:35.543 --> 00:05:37.253
- five, six…
- Are you embarrassed?

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:39.714
- Of course. Why do you wear--
- Then get out.

00:05:39.797 --> 00:05:43.217
I don't want to teach someone
who finds our uniforms embarrassing.

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:44.969
We're not here by choice, either.

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:46.804
No!

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:48.264
- Why are you…
- Stretch your legs.

00:05:48.347 --> 00:05:51.768
…letting those Rugby Team beasts
join the training, Ms. Kang?

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:56.773
Due to their coach's suspension,
they're behind on lesson hours.

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.483
Still, you can't put that on us…

00:06:00.193 --> 00:06:01.360
Push harder!

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:11.204
Why are they all spandex?

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:12.413
Hey, bring it on.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:14.540
You're a wrestler? For how long?

00:06:14.624 --> 00:06:16.084
Bring it on.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.753
Are you scared? Come at me.

00:06:18.836 --> 00:06:20.505
Scared? You can't do anything.

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:21.798
Time-out.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.217
Geez.

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.598
Is this balanced or what?

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:34.560
These arrows… are 100,000 won each.

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:36.062
Ma'am, is this how you do it?

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.526
PERFECT SHOT EVERY TIME

00:06:41.609 --> 00:06:43.027
- Sorry.
- Get lost!

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:43.945
I'm sorry.

00:06:47.073 --> 00:06:48.574
En garde.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:49.575
<i>Allongez le bras.</i>

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:50.868
<i>Fente.</i>

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:52.703
En garde.

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:54.997
What are you doing? Hold it properly.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.339
Rugby Team!

00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:04.632
REQUEST FOR JOINT TRAINING

00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:09.053
No. Tell them we can't do it.
They'll ruin our training atmosphere.

00:07:09.137 --> 00:07:12.181
It's the principal's order.
I couldn't say no.

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:16.561
For goodness' sake. What's she thinking?

00:07:16.644 --> 00:07:17.728
COUNSELING OFFICE

00:07:17.812 --> 00:07:19.105
Did you calculate it?

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:21.524
Yes. You and the other coaches
of record-based sports

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:24.152
such as archery, swimming,
and track and field

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:25.653
are expected to agree to it.

00:07:25.736 --> 00:07:28.239
That's not enough.
I need definite answers.

00:07:28.322 --> 00:07:29.323
Yes, sir.

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:31.951
What about the rest?

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:33.244
I'm talking to them right now.

00:07:33.327 --> 00:07:37.039
Everyone with contract renewals
next year will agree to it

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.792
since you'll be the principal by then.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:42.503
Are you done with the evaluation
for your promotion?

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:44.755
The school management skills
are yet to be evaluated.

00:07:45.798 --> 00:07:47.800
That's why I need great results this year.

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:50.553
But the Rugby Team will be of no help.

00:07:50.636 --> 00:07:51.721
Of course not.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:56.184
They'll be dead weight.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:08:01.814
Why don't we disband the team
as soon as Ju Ga-ram gets dismissed?

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:05.401
The faster they get disbanded,
the faster we can use their budget…

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:07.445
- What's holding you?
- Right.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.990
We can use their budget faster.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:12.700
That's how we can…

00:08:13.534 --> 00:08:14.911
Go. You're in the way.

00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:16.954
Okay.

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:22.168
Anyway, that's how we can
simplify the system too.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.961
What do you think?

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:39.393
Guys, gather around.

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.522
Sit down.

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.357
Hey, what are you doing?

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.900
Gather toward the center.

00:08:45.983 --> 00:08:48.027
JU GA-RAM

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:49.195
Look forward.

00:08:49.278 --> 00:08:50.112
BAE I-JI

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:53.032
Everybody, look forward and pose.

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:54.742
One, two, three.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:00.957
HANYANG HIGH WINS!
2005 86TH NATIONAL SPORTS FESTIVAL

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.709
Geez. How long ago was this?

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:05.836
- Hasn't it been 20 years?
- Don't talk to me.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:10.800
Once the petition is passed,
you'll no longer be here.

00:09:10.883 --> 00:09:11.801
I-ji.

00:09:11.884 --> 00:09:14.345
Stay out of my sight
and lay low until you leave.

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.608
<i>Vote nay!</i>

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:30.778
Say no!

00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:35.825
Say nay!

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:45.668
Yang Seung.

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:47.962
- What?
- You'll vote against it, right?

00:09:48.045 --> 00:09:51.215
- Right. Our friendship of 20 years…
- You'll definitely vote yes.

00:09:51.716 --> 00:09:52.758
Right?

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:57.722
I thought we lived in a country
with a secret ballot system.

00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:00.600
HANYANG HIGH BALLOT BOX

00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:02.602
Did everyone vote, then?

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:11.277
- Sorry.
- Hey. Come here. Cast your vote.

00:10:20.119 --> 00:10:21.662
VOTE ON COACH JU'S DISMISSAL

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:29.754
AGREE

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:41.265
It seems like all the votes are in.
We'll open the ballot box.

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:42.850
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:47.021
We'll count the votes now.

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:50.024
"Agree."

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.194
AGREE

00:10:55.529 --> 00:10:56.781
"Agree."

00:11:01.285 --> 00:11:02.286
"Disagree?"

00:11:05.414 --> 00:11:06.248
Okay.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:07.249
DISAGREE

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:10.086
"Agree, disagree, agree,
agree, disagree, disagree,

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:12.463
agree, disagree, agree, agree."

00:11:16.342 --> 00:11:18.010
AGREE 20 : DISAGREE 19

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:19.095
"Disagree."

00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:26.143
- "Agree."
- How many ballots are left?

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:28.938
We have three left.

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:41.117
"Disagree."

00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:43.119
Are you sure?

00:11:43.744 --> 00:11:44.787

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:58.134

AGREE 22 : DISAGREE 21

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:04.473
The last one.

00:12:15.192 --> 00:12:17.153
Sorry. My hands are sweaty.

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:18.320
Okay.

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:24.827
There you go.

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:33.711
What?

00:12:34.378 --> 00:12:36.172
- What is it?
- Well, it's…

00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:39.175
It's…

00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:40.301
Say it.

00:12:41.218 --> 00:12:43.554
Should I just say it?

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:54.940
"Disagree."

00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.575
Wait.

00:13:04.658 --> 00:13:07.870
Did you really understand
what the vote was about?

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:10.998
<i>How was it?</i>

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:12.708
ELEVEN HOURS AGO

00:13:12.791 --> 00:13:14.960
They're too much.
We couldn't practice at all.

00:13:15.044 --> 00:13:17.546
I lost count of how many arrows
got destroyed.

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:19.924
I almost lost my life too.

00:13:21.258 --> 00:13:26.180
Is it their grand plan to dump them on us
once Ju Ga-ram gets fired?

00:13:26.263 --> 00:13:28.599
They won't send them
to Track and Field, right?

00:13:28.682 --> 00:13:30.309
You're most likely to get them.

00:13:30.392 --> 00:13:31.268
They're good runners.

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.646
I can't take them.

00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:36.732
You don't even know how many times
my wig came off because of them.

00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:37.775
Darn it.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:41.403
Once they're disbanded,
the Shooting Team will get all the budget

00:13:41.487 --> 00:13:43.155
while we have to clean up their mess.

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:46.075
You know what?

00:13:46.617 --> 00:13:47.868
What was that?

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:49.411
The voting is anonymous.

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:55.209
Vice Principal.

00:13:55.292 --> 00:13:59.588
Our teachers wouldn't confuse
such a thing.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:00.589
Am I right?

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.347
AGREE 22 : DISAGREE 21

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.141
AGREE 22 : DISAGREE 22

00:14:11.725 --> 00:14:15.521
In case of a tie,
the rule is to keep the status quo.

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:18.566
The dismissal petition
has been voted down.

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:21.151
Yes!

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:25.573
Coach Ju, please take good care
of our Rugby Team.

00:14:25.656 --> 00:14:28.158
Thank you. I'll do my best.

00:14:39.003 --> 00:14:42.715
First, we should find out the traitors

00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:44.425
and cut down their budget.

00:14:44.508 --> 00:14:46.176
How will we find them?

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.386
Exactly.

00:14:47.469 --> 00:14:49.597
It'd be hard because it was anonymous.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.224
I just don't get it.

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:53.642
Are they that stupid?

00:14:54.685 --> 00:14:57.479
We got such a result
because they aren't stupid.

00:14:58.272 --> 00:14:59.940
They were worried the rugby players

00:15:00.816 --> 00:15:03.611
would become their problem
once the team was disbanded.

00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:07.990
You're right. Those pricks!

00:15:15.956 --> 00:15:17.791
What are you going to do now?

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:22.588
I'll find a way.

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:39.563
A shaken mind shakes the barrel.

00:15:40.981 --> 00:15:42.858
Let's just focus on the routine.

00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:03.128
<i>The sweat we shed</i>

00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:06.131
<i>Fills up the Hangang River</i>

00:16:06.882 --> 00:16:13.514
<i>The chant we shout together</i>
<i>Wakes up our passion</i>

00:16:13.597 --> 00:16:17.059
<i>Raise your torch</i>

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:20.312
<i>Until the new day breaks</i>

00:16:20.396 --> 00:16:21.939
<i>We run…</i>

00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:23.565
Come out.

00:16:28.696 --> 00:16:30.072
COACH JU GA-RAM

00:16:30.155 --> 00:16:33.742
<i>We run toward the golden sky</i>

00:16:45.087 --> 00:16:47.047
Hey, are you out of your mind?

00:16:47.131 --> 00:16:49.299
How could an active athlete smoke?

00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:52.594
I started smoking exactly three years ago.

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:57.808
Sorry.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.770
I had a lot of questions for you
when we met again.

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.357
Why'd you do it?

00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:09.153
Why'd you dope? You didn't even drink
or smoke while playing rugby.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.489
You weren't even in a slump.

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:16.201
Why'd you do it
at the peak of your career?

00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:18.162
Why on earth?

00:17:21.081 --> 00:17:23.751
Why'd you have to leave me like that?

00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:28.047
After dating for ten years,
you just vanished without a word.

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:32.593
Did you think
there was no need to say anything?

00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:35.971
Did I mean nothing to you?

00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:37.681
That's not it, I-ji.

00:17:37.765 --> 00:17:40.684
But now, I have nothing to ask you.

00:17:42.936 --> 00:17:44.772
I don't even want to hear it now.

00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:49.985
I had something to tell you
three years ago.

00:17:50.903 --> 00:17:52.988
But I waited, hoping to say it in person.

00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:58.786
Let's break up, Ju Ga-ram.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.842
I-ji.

00:18:23.811 --> 00:18:24.645
Let go.

00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:54.591
DAESANG HIGH SCHOOL

00:18:54.675 --> 00:18:58.929
Daesang High's Rugby Team asked to hold
the last summer practice match with us.

00:18:59.012 --> 00:19:02.850
Why would Daesang High
want to have a practice match with us?

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:05.561
We don't have to worry
about their reasoning.

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:10.232
I think this will be our chance
to evaluate our new coach.

00:19:11.775 --> 00:19:15.362
He's a rookie coach with no experience.
We should see what he's got.

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:40.596
I'll train separately.

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:43.182
HANYANG PARK

00:19:43.265 --> 00:19:44.266
Why?

00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:45.976
Is it too tough for you?

00:19:47.853 --> 00:19:49.688
If this is too much, you can quit.

00:19:50.772 --> 00:19:51.982
Forget it.

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:00.324
Seriously.

00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:03.368
Geez.

00:20:05.996 --> 00:20:09.082
Why won't you guys listen to me?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.793
That's my line.

00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:13.962
Ms. Kang.

00:20:19.885 --> 00:20:20.802
Turn it down.

00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:25.182
We've played them eight times
over the last five years and got 0 points.

00:20:25.265 --> 00:20:27.392
We couldn't even score a single try.

00:20:27.476 --> 00:20:30.437
It was 47 to 0, 55 to 0, and 72 to 0.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.315
We were beaten pretty badly.

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:35.108
They're setting up a match you can't win.

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:38.779
When you lose,
they'll question your ability

00:20:38.862 --> 00:20:40.405
and try to replace you.

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:45.244
Is this the last game
before school starts?

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:46.620
According to the schedule, yes.

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:51.166
All right.

00:20:52.125 --> 00:20:54.169
- Hey, what are you doing?
- You do it too.

00:20:55.837 --> 00:20:57.839
Can you defeat them?

00:20:57.923 --> 00:20:59.549
No, of course not.

00:20:59.633 --> 00:21:02.052
As a coach, shouldn't you at least

00:21:02.135 --> 00:21:04.304
have the decency
to pretend there's a plan?

00:21:04.388 --> 00:21:06.765
Ms. Educator, are you asking me to lie?

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:09.434
Gosh.

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:22.864
SO MYEONG-U

00:21:43.093 --> 00:21:44.761
- What?
- What?

00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:46.471
They're gone.

00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:47.723
What is?

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:50.434
My GoPro and external drive.

00:21:50.517 --> 00:21:52.978
Everything is gone.

00:21:53.061 --> 00:21:54.688
What the hell?

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:57.357
Good gracious.

00:21:57.441 --> 00:21:58.984
- What now?
- Did someone…

00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:03.071
want me? Is that why they took my records?

00:22:04.197 --> 00:22:05.532
Could it be a stalker fan?

00:22:06.241 --> 00:22:08.952
- I swear, something's wrong with him.
- Where'd they go?

00:22:09.036 --> 00:22:12.331
It has all the videos
of our matches and training--

00:22:12.414 --> 00:22:13.915
It does.

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.917
They're all in here.

00:22:20.714 --> 00:22:22.632
FORMATION TRAINING PLAN

00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:28.930
Coach, what is this?

00:22:30.724 --> 00:22:32.350
Attention.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.270
We have a practice match!

00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:41.443
Our opponent is Daesang High School!

00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:44.821
We'll lose again.

00:22:44.905 --> 00:22:46.740
I don't think he knows the reality.

00:22:46.823 --> 00:22:49.326
How can we beat Daesang?
We'll lose for sure.

00:22:50.285 --> 00:22:51.745
What? Aren't you happy?

00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:56.124
Are you trying to discourage us
before the season even starts?

00:22:56.208 --> 00:22:57.334
Are you discouraged?

00:22:58.126 --> 00:22:59.461
Without even trying?

00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:12.891
"Formation training plan."
You can memorize them, right?

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:15.519
Yes, we can.

00:23:15.602 --> 00:23:16.728
Good.

00:23:16.812 --> 00:23:18.146
- Seon-ho.
- Yes?

00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:21.191
Here.

00:23:21.274 --> 00:23:23.068
Ju-yang, Myeong-u.

00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:24.694
Yeong-gwang.

00:23:24.778 --> 00:23:25.737
Here.

00:23:26.571 --> 00:23:28.198
Hyeong-sik.

00:23:28.281 --> 00:23:30.700
Tae-pung, Seong-jun.

00:23:31.827 --> 00:23:34.454
They're weighted balls.
Hold onto them even in your sleep.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:39.501
If anyone steals the ball from them,

00:23:40.794 --> 00:23:42.337
I'll buy you chicken.

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:43.713
Chicken, my foot.

00:23:45.257 --> 00:23:46.633
It's Daesang High…

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.848
Hey.

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:55.851
- Read the room, will you?
- Okay.

00:24:16.454 --> 00:24:17.831
Will this be enough for us to win?

00:24:17.914 --> 00:24:18.957
Of course not.

00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:25.422
They won
the last National Sports Festival.

00:24:25.505 --> 00:24:26.715
It's the top high school team.

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:29.467
Currently, even our best effort
wouldn't be enough.

00:24:30.844 --> 00:24:31.970
So you know.

00:24:35.932 --> 00:24:37.309
Why do you want us to play?

00:24:38.018 --> 00:24:39.769
You have to learn to lose well.

00:24:41.897 --> 00:24:44.232
How can we lose better
after losing for three years?

00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:49.696
I mean losing without giving up.

00:24:49.779 --> 00:24:50.906
We never gave up.

00:24:52.574 --> 00:24:54.242
We gave it our all.

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:56.620
"Learn to lose well"?

00:24:58.538 --> 00:25:01.416
There's no such thing.
Losing is just losing.

00:25:02.375 --> 00:25:04.628
Isn't it a coach's job
to teach us how to win?

00:25:06.004 --> 00:25:07.005
Yes.

00:25:07.881 --> 00:25:08.715
You're right.

00:25:10.133 --> 00:25:12.302
You're right about that. Still,

00:25:12.385 --> 00:25:15.263
an obsession with victory
can cost a player dearly.

00:25:17.307 --> 00:25:21.228
I don't plan to be the kind of coach
who wrecks his players.

00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:29.319
Or maybe we can't win
because you're a loser at life.

00:25:33.114 --> 00:25:33.949
Also…

00:25:35.283 --> 00:25:38.119
I don't need a juicer
teaching me how to lose.

00:25:50.924 --> 00:25:53.510
I guess we can't play
because we're undermanned.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:58.390
Tae-pung.

00:25:58.473 --> 00:25:59.557
Captain.

00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:00.767
- Captain.
- Seong-jun.

00:26:01.726 --> 00:26:02.852
Where are you going?

00:26:13.196 --> 00:26:14.030
Hey.

00:26:14.823 --> 00:26:16.908
Rugby! You need
a permission slip to leave!

00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:40.265
FOR YOUR GLORY
TOGETHER, WE SHINE

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:46.187
VICTORY IS FOR THE PREPARED

00:26:49.816 --> 00:26:51.401
Isn't that Yoon Seok-jun?

00:26:51.484 --> 00:26:53.153
Goodness. He's so handsome.

00:26:53.236 --> 00:26:54.529
This is crazy.

00:26:54.612 --> 00:26:56.031
I'm a huge fan.

00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:57.949
Excuse me, aren't you Yoon Seok-jun?

00:26:58.533 --> 00:27:00.243
You got the wrong guy.

00:27:01.786 --> 00:27:03.288
What is it? Do you know him?

00:27:03.371 --> 00:27:05.040
He's Seok-jun.

00:27:05.123 --> 00:27:06.875
The one who made it
into the Spanish league.

00:27:08.585 --> 00:27:09.502
One,

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:11.254
two,

00:27:12.922 --> 00:27:15.091
three, four…

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:17.635
Five,

00:27:19.387 --> 00:27:20.305
six,

00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:22.307
se…

00:27:25.852 --> 00:27:26.811
Six.

00:27:27.979 --> 00:27:29.356
Seriously.

00:27:29.439 --> 00:27:32.025
Why are you poking them
like you're testing fruit?

00:27:32.942 --> 00:27:34.027
They'll get bruised.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:35.236
What?

00:27:37.072 --> 00:27:38.698
Their body is all they've got.

00:27:38.782 --> 00:27:40.909
If this hurts, they should just quit now.

00:27:40.992 --> 00:27:43.036
I meant their feelings, not literally.

00:27:44.621 --> 00:27:49.250
The captain went AWOL.
Did he hate his coach that much?

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:50.752
- Yes.
- What?

00:27:50.835 --> 00:27:52.504
He left because he hates me.

00:27:52.587 --> 00:27:55.423
I saw him leave, so he didn't go AWOL.
He just left.

00:27:55.507 --> 00:27:57.008
That's some confidence,

00:27:57.717 --> 00:27:59.719
considering the situation.

00:27:59.803 --> 00:28:01.763
I'll be letting the school know tomorrow.

00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:02.931
Got it, sir!

00:28:11.731 --> 00:28:13.233
- You're dismissed.
- Yes, sir.

00:28:36.589 --> 00:28:37.590
Mom.

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:44.347
STAR ROOKIE, YOON SEOK-JUN

00:28:46.641 --> 00:28:47.475
Mom?

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:49.728
AWARD, YOON SEOK-JUN

00:28:57.193 --> 00:28:58.278
<i>Hello?</i>

00:28:58.778 --> 00:29:01.322
Mom, are you in Spain to see Seok-jun?

00:29:01.406 --> 00:29:05.118
<i>Yes, I was worried about how he'd adjust</i>
<i>to the new environment.</i>

00:29:05.201 --> 00:29:07.704
You should have told me.

00:29:07.787 --> 00:29:10.290
<i>You're in the dorm anyway.</i>

00:29:10.373 --> 00:29:12.542
<i>Why are you home?</i>
<i>Is there something wrong?</i>

00:29:12.625 --> 00:29:15.253
- No, it's just--
<i>- Seong-jun, I got to go.</i>

00:29:15.336 --> 00:29:17.464
<i>Seok-jun has to get going.</i>

00:29:17.547 --> 00:29:19.132
<i>Eat well.</i>

00:29:32.061 --> 00:29:33.188
Geez.

00:29:36.608 --> 00:29:37.734
Thanks for the food!

00:29:37.817 --> 00:29:38.777
Thank you. Come again.

00:29:44.908 --> 00:29:46.284
How are your players?

00:29:47.535 --> 00:29:49.537
MA SEOK-BONG
FORMER RUGBY TEAM MEMBER

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:51.748
- The kids hate me.
- The whole country does.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.464
It's not like that.
They won't listen to me.

00:29:59.547 --> 00:30:03.092
Come on. Sure, their senior shamelessly
took some illegal substances,

00:30:03.176 --> 00:30:05.053
but how dare they ignore their coach?

00:30:05.136 --> 00:30:07.138
Should I go teach them a lesson?
Good gracious.

00:30:07.222 --> 00:30:09.140
- Hello, Ms. Kang.
- Yes.

00:30:09.224 --> 00:30:11.810
They'll surely listen to a senior
who runs a chicken store

00:30:11.893 --> 00:30:13.394
when they don't listen to him.

00:30:14.437 --> 00:30:16.231
- Right?
- Yang Seung.

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:21.027
Don't give him any free food.
Make sure he pays.

00:30:25.824 --> 00:30:27.242
- Hey, Seok-bong.
- Yes?

00:30:27.325 --> 00:30:28.952
How long has he been like this?

00:30:29.035 --> 00:30:30.370
About an hour?

00:30:30.954 --> 00:30:32.539
Then pull yourself together.

00:30:32.622 --> 00:30:34.582
- Ms. Kang.
- Go and resolve this.

00:30:35.458 --> 00:30:37.544
"Am I doing okay? Why am I even here?"

00:30:37.627 --> 00:30:39.712
"If it weren't me…" Blah-blah.

00:30:39.796 --> 00:30:41.589
Just how deep do you want to sink?

00:30:41.673 --> 00:30:44.717
Geez, are you a mind reader nowadays?

00:30:48.930 --> 00:30:52.308
Then what's on Seong-jun's mind right now?

00:30:52.392 --> 00:30:54.352
You already know.

00:30:55.144 --> 00:31:00.275
I guess, "I hate Ju Ga-ram so much,
but I still want to play rugby."

00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:13.246
<i>Check. Mic check.</i>

00:31:15.748 --> 00:31:17.917
<i>A coach is here.</i>

00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:23.256
<i>A coach has come to find his player</i>
<i>who ran away without a permission slip.</i>

00:31:23.339 --> 00:31:25.425
<i>A coach is here.</i>

00:31:25.508 --> 00:31:29.971
<i>We're looking for a player</i>
<i>who is six feet tall, weighs 75 kg,</i>

00:31:30.054 --> 00:31:32.307
<i>and is in good condition.</i>

00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:34.309
<i>A coach is here.</i>

00:31:34.851 --> 00:31:36.686
A coach is here

00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:41.357
to find a player
who is six feet tall, weighs 75 kg,

00:31:41.441 --> 00:31:43.818
and is in good condition.

00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:45.820
A coach is here.

00:31:52.452 --> 00:31:54.829
He has found the player.

00:31:54.913 --> 00:31:58.958
He's found the player
with a good body but shitty personality.

00:32:10.929 --> 00:32:13.264
Hurry and follow me.

00:32:13.348 --> 00:32:15.433
This is terribly embarrassing for me too.

00:32:19.729 --> 00:32:20.980
Nice!

00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:22.649
Are you nuts?

00:32:22.732 --> 00:32:23.816
What are you…

00:32:24.525 --> 00:32:26.027
What are you doing?

00:32:32.533 --> 00:32:37.038
Hey, who wears cleats on asphalt?
You'll mess up your ankles.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.208
Put these on.

00:32:54.931 --> 00:32:56.015
Why are you here?

00:32:56.933 --> 00:32:57.767
What?

00:32:58.851 --> 00:33:00.186
I have a question for you.

00:33:08.611 --> 00:33:10.738
Is it me that you hate or rugby?

00:33:14.742 --> 00:33:17.161
If I say it's you,
will you leave the team?

00:33:17.245 --> 00:33:18.621
I can't do that.

00:33:19.455 --> 00:33:23.209
Although it hurts terribly,
I guess I'll have to accept it.

00:33:24.085 --> 00:33:27.296
But are you going to give up rugby
just because you hate me?

00:33:29.173 --> 00:33:33.052
- Does rugby mean nothing to you?
- No, I didn't mean that.

00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:34.012
Then…

00:33:36.222 --> 00:33:38.224
let's play rugby together.

00:33:44.731 --> 00:33:46.065
Yes, well…

00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:47.483
As you said,

00:33:47.567 --> 00:33:50.111
I ruined my career with my own hands.

00:33:53.156 --> 00:33:54.323
With that experience,

00:33:56.117 --> 00:33:58.828
I'll prevent you from ruining yours.

00:34:03.041 --> 00:34:04.250
I don't know…

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.378
what the right path is.

00:34:08.171 --> 00:34:09.589
But since I've walked…

00:34:12.008 --> 00:34:13.301
the wrong one myself,

00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:15.887
I can help you avoid that.

00:34:20.099 --> 00:34:21.726
I'll make sure you won't end up like me.

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.104
I mean it.

00:34:43.831 --> 00:34:45.249
Geez.

00:34:47.043 --> 00:34:50.421
Hey, wear these.
You'll really hurt your ankles.

00:34:52.882 --> 00:34:53.800
Here.

00:34:56.344 --> 00:34:57.678
I'll take these.

00:35:02.975 --> 00:35:04.185
See you at school.

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:27.750
Do you think the school bulletin board
is reserved

00:35:27.834 --> 00:35:30.253
just for announcing
the Rugby Team's punishments?

00:35:30.336 --> 00:35:32.004
No way.

00:35:32.088 --> 00:35:33.631
Sharing is caring.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.468
If this happens again,

00:35:37.552 --> 00:35:41.347
I'll ban your team from participating
in tournaments this year.

00:36:03.369 --> 00:36:05.705
- Well…
- Gosh.

00:36:05.788 --> 00:36:06.873
I mean…

00:36:06.956 --> 00:36:08.291
Well…

00:36:19.427 --> 00:36:21.971
Geez. You scared me.

00:36:22.054 --> 00:36:23.347
- Are you back?
- Yes.

00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:25.183
- Wait.
- Yikes.

00:36:25.266 --> 00:36:27.476
- I thought it was the dorm supervisor.
- I smell puke.

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.270
- What is this smell?
- Go wash yourself.

00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:30.521
Sorry.

00:36:30.605 --> 00:36:33.107
- Ju-yang, did you not wash?
- I was in a hurry.

00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:34.692
Let's get back to where we were.

00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:38.696
For this strategy,
I need to kill their momentum.

00:36:38.779 --> 00:36:40.990
After stealing the ball from them,

00:36:41.073 --> 00:36:43.117
- I pass it to Yeong-gwang right away.
- Yes.

00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:46.871
Then Seon-ho, Ju-yang, and I
spread out to create some space.

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:49.081
I see.

00:36:49.165 --> 00:36:50.082
- What…
- That's it.

00:36:50.166 --> 00:36:52.501
This was the problem.

00:36:52.585 --> 00:36:54.128
- This is it.
- Lights out.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.509
We're past curfew.
We'll get punished again.

00:37:00.593 --> 00:37:02.929
Because of who?

00:37:05.723 --> 00:37:06.849
You're dismissed.

00:37:06.933 --> 00:37:08.017
- Okay.
- Yes.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.769
Yes. We should go.

00:37:10.519 --> 00:37:13.064
- Good night.
- Yeong-gwang. Can I take this?

00:37:53.646 --> 00:37:56.232
HANYANG HIGH ATTACK

00:37:59.402 --> 00:38:00.820
IN A RUCK, FIGHT BACK AND…

00:38:06.659 --> 00:38:07.576
Go back down.

00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:08.995
Hurry.

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:11.872
Go!

00:38:15.084 --> 00:38:16.252
What about me, Coach?

00:38:16.335 --> 00:38:20.881
Seon-ho and Ju-yang will receive the ball
from Tae-pung on the opposite side.

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:21.799
What about me?

00:38:21.882 --> 00:38:24.802
You need to turn all the way
to draw them to this side.

00:38:24.885 --> 00:38:26.387
That makes sense.

00:38:36.439 --> 00:38:37.815
Then Tae-pung will spread out.

00:38:40.443 --> 00:38:43.404
Yes. That's it.

00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:47.158
- Hey! Hey!
- I can do this!

00:38:52.955 --> 00:38:55.166
DAESANG HIGH SCHOOL RUGBY TEAM

00:38:55.249 --> 00:38:58.044
Daesang High,
assemble at the field quickly.

00:38:58.127 --> 00:38:59.462
Yes, sir.

00:39:03.257 --> 00:39:04.175
Hello.

00:39:04.884 --> 00:39:06.385
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:39:07.386 --> 00:39:08.304
Seong-jun.

00:39:20.232 --> 00:39:21.192
Take a seat.

00:39:30.242 --> 00:39:32.495
I didn't expect you to come back with him.

00:39:35.873 --> 00:39:37.833
Don't you want to play college rugby?

00:39:39.085 --> 00:39:40.544
Yes, I do.

00:39:41.504 --> 00:39:44.715
With the team's current performance,
it won't be easy,

00:39:44.799 --> 00:39:46.592
but it's not impossible.

00:39:50.763 --> 00:39:52.348
A principal's recommendation

00:39:52.431 --> 00:39:56.227
can get at least one rugby player
into college.

00:39:57.686 --> 00:40:01.148
PRINCIPAL'S RECOMMENDATION TRACK

00:40:02.024 --> 00:40:04.777
Yoon Seok-jun, the soccer player,
is your twin brother?

00:40:05.694 --> 00:40:06.529
Yes.

00:40:06.612 --> 00:40:07.988
He made it to Europe.

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:10.282
I hear he might become a senior pro.

00:40:10.366 --> 00:40:12.785
Wouldn't it be sad if the other twin
didn't even make it to college?

00:40:16.455 --> 00:40:18.290
Boycott today's match.

00:40:20.918 --> 00:40:22.044
If you do…

00:40:25.881 --> 00:40:28.634
- What is it?
- You were here.

00:40:28.717 --> 00:40:30.636
The match is about to begin.

00:40:30.719 --> 00:40:32.346
So I'm here to pick him up.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:34.682
Can't you see
he's getting college counseling?

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:37.977
What kind of college counseling
happens behind the coach's back?

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.103
Isn't that weird?

00:40:43.107 --> 00:40:44.150
Go get ready.

00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:48.112
ROLLING ADMISSION FOR 2026

00:40:51.657 --> 00:40:54.076
Hey, who wears cleats on asphalt?

00:40:55.578 --> 00:40:56.495
Put these on.

00:41:11.927 --> 00:41:13.679
Enough is enough, Mr. Seong.

00:41:13.762 --> 00:41:14.847
What?

00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:18.100
Don't drag the kids into your plans
by pressuring them.

00:41:19.935 --> 00:41:20.936
If you must,

00:41:21.770 --> 00:41:23.105
do it to me.

00:41:23.189 --> 00:41:25.316
I'm old enough now.

00:41:27.026 --> 00:41:27.943
Well, then.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.951
Back to your positions.

00:41:38.746 --> 00:41:39.622
Faster.

00:41:39.705 --> 00:41:41.457
- Faster.
- Okay.

00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:44.084
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:46.629
What is it? Why are you so late?

00:41:46.712 --> 00:41:47.880
- It's nothing.
- Hey.

00:41:49.423 --> 00:41:52.301
You're an idiot if you got played
by the vice principal again,

00:41:52.384 --> 00:41:55.679
- You should step down as captain.
- Bullshit.

00:41:56.263 --> 00:41:57.723
You should worry about yourself.

00:41:57.806 --> 00:42:01.101
You lost so much muscle from studying,
I bet you can't even tackle anyone.

00:42:05.147 --> 00:42:08.067
So, how are you with your players?

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:12.530
They understand human language
better than dogs' barks.

00:42:15.241 --> 00:42:17.826
- You sound confident.
- Unlike someone, I don't blame kids

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:19.078
and then run away.

00:42:21.288 --> 00:42:25.251
Soon you'll realize
that they're as hopeless as you.

00:42:35.636 --> 00:42:37.471
Geez, who did this?

00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:40.266
Who dares to…

00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:41.517
- Seung-hui.
- You.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.269
Why are you here, not at your restaurant?

00:42:43.352 --> 00:42:47.898
It's a slow time with no customers.
Plus, Ga-ram is making a debut as a coach.

00:42:47.982 --> 00:42:49.441
How could I be frying chicken?

00:42:49.525 --> 00:42:50.442
What?

00:42:50.526 --> 00:42:53.487
I have to give him
the spirit of Hanyang's ace.

00:43:04.623 --> 00:43:06.875
Coach, I'll call it a day.

00:43:06.959 --> 00:43:07.960
Really?

00:43:08.043 --> 00:43:09.503
Are you unwell, Seol-hyeon?

00:43:10.212 --> 00:43:11.088
No.

00:43:11.171 --> 00:43:12.756
I want to see the rugby match.

00:43:13.632 --> 00:43:14.592
The rugby match?

00:43:14.675 --> 00:43:16.760
What for? If you have the time,

00:43:16.844 --> 00:43:18.971
you should get a massage instead.

00:43:19.054 --> 00:43:21.098
I'm actually getting one after the match.

00:43:21.181 --> 00:43:22.474
Dad's picking me up.

00:43:23.058 --> 00:43:25.102
Your dad is? Go ahead, then.

00:43:25.185 --> 00:43:27.104
Never mind. Let's go.

00:43:27.187 --> 00:43:28.439
I'm not ready yet.

00:43:28.522 --> 00:43:32.901
It's all right.
Coach Bae, please clean up her stuff.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.822
- And throw this away. Let's go.
- My bag.

00:43:37.406 --> 00:43:38.324
Give it to me.

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.743
Three or more form a scrum.

00:43:40.826 --> 00:43:42.494
- Then we tackle. Okay?
- Yes, sir!

00:43:42.578 --> 00:43:45.164
When we attack, use Strategy One and Four.

00:43:45.247 --> 00:43:48.334
- When our backs move up…
- Coach, what's our strategy?

00:43:49.918 --> 00:43:52.379
Today, we keep doing
what you've been doing.

00:43:52.463 --> 00:43:53.547
- What?
- What?

00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:55.132
- What?
- Pardon?

00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:57.801
Rugby is all about teamwork.

00:43:57.885 --> 00:44:01.430
Do you think the formations you've jammed
into your head will work now?

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:04.016
We haven't even played as a team yet.

00:44:05.684 --> 00:44:07.478
- Are you ready for war?
- Yes, sir!

00:44:07.561 --> 00:44:08.646
Daesang!

00:44:10.773 --> 00:44:12.107
Let's do this!

00:44:12.191 --> 00:44:13.484
- Let's chant.
- Let's go!

00:44:20.491 --> 00:44:21.325
Hanyang!

00:44:21.408 --> 00:44:23.494
Hanyang!

00:44:23.577 --> 00:44:24.953
- Hanyang!
- Let's go!

00:44:25.037 --> 00:44:26.163
Let's do this!

00:44:27.289 --> 00:44:28.332
Let's go!

00:44:41.136 --> 00:44:42.596
Seong-jun, good luck!

00:45:13.335 --> 00:45:14.169
Coach.

00:45:15.838 --> 00:45:16.672
Are you done?

00:45:18.257 --> 00:45:19.800
You still have 50 shots left.

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:21.677
I'll call it a day.

00:45:26.807 --> 00:45:27.850
Myeong-u.

00:45:34.273 --> 00:45:35.399
Keep going.

00:45:39.194 --> 00:45:41.405
That's it. Pass.

00:45:41.488 --> 00:45:43.449
- Darn it.
- Are you a scarecrow?

00:45:43.532 --> 00:45:44.783
You're no fun to tackle.

00:45:44.867 --> 00:45:46.535
For fuck's sake.

00:45:46.618 --> 00:45:48.036
Steal it.

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:52.124
- Steal it!
- You have to stop him.

00:45:52.708 --> 00:45:54.001
Throw it!

00:45:57.045 --> 00:45:58.589
Yes!

00:45:59.590 --> 00:46:02.426
HANYANG : DAESANG
00 : 05

00:46:05.637 --> 00:46:07.764
Are you going to be satisfied with a try?

00:46:08.515 --> 00:46:09.475
I can't believe them.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:15.022
They lost points in just 50 seconds.
Their defense sucks.

00:46:15.105 --> 00:46:18.942
They're up against opponents
who don't match their size or speed.

00:46:19.026 --> 00:46:21.445
That shows that the opponents
know us well.

00:46:21.528 --> 00:46:22.863
Darn it.

00:46:24.656 --> 00:46:25.908
What is he doing?

00:46:25.991 --> 00:46:29.203
A successful touchdown
over the line is called a try.

00:46:29.286 --> 00:46:32.998
A successful try gives you five points
and a chance to kick.

00:46:35.167 --> 00:46:38.337
If the ball goes through the posts,
you score two more points.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:40.130
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

00:46:40.214 --> 00:46:42.508
HANYANG 00 : 07 DAESANG
FIRST HALF

00:46:46.428 --> 00:46:47.888
We still have plenty of time.

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:49.640
- We got this.
- Those traitors.

00:46:56.688 --> 00:46:58.065
Set!

00:47:05.781 --> 00:47:07.407
- Throw, Seong-jun.
- Run!

00:47:26.051 --> 00:47:27.344
Get him.

00:47:28.387 --> 00:47:29.972
Run faster.

00:47:30.055 --> 00:47:32.224
- Stop him.
- We have to stop him.

00:47:37.479 --> 00:47:39.731
- Captain!
- Here.

00:47:44.611 --> 00:47:46.196
You motherfucker.

00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.698
Hey!

00:47:47.781 --> 00:47:49.658
I'll kill you, piece of shit.

00:47:49.741 --> 00:47:50.909
Fucking son of a bitch.

00:47:50.993 --> 00:47:52.452
- Hyeong-sik.
- You bastard!

00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:55.414
Hanyang's 4 is out for 2 minutes.

00:47:57.082 --> 00:47:58.875
They started it.

00:47:58.959 --> 00:48:01.086
- When they passed…
- Hurry and get out.

00:48:01.169 --> 00:48:02.671
What did you teach them?

00:48:02.754 --> 00:48:05.173
Are they here to fight or to play?

00:48:06.174 --> 00:48:07.843
- Goodness.
- That guy.

00:48:07.926 --> 00:48:09.428
I can't stand him.

00:48:10.887 --> 00:48:12.639
There's nothing to see here.

00:48:15.934 --> 00:48:16.935
Are you leaving?

00:48:21.315 --> 00:48:22.274
Hey, run.

00:48:24.276 --> 00:48:25.444
- Block him.
- Get him.

00:48:26.612 --> 00:48:28.196
Hurry and stop him.

00:48:48.383 --> 00:48:50.093
FIRST HALF

00:48:50.177 --> 00:48:52.888
HANYANG 00 : 28 DAESANG

00:48:55.057 --> 00:48:55.974
Darn it.

00:49:10.322 --> 00:49:13.200
HANYANG 00 : 35 DAESANG

00:49:14.576 --> 00:49:15.410
Are you all right?

00:49:15.494 --> 00:49:16.662
I twisted my ankle.

00:49:18.747 --> 00:49:20.082
Geez.

00:49:22.084 --> 00:49:23.251
They didn't even do much.

00:49:23.335 --> 00:49:27.172
You're so kind to them
when they couldn't even score once.

00:49:27.255 --> 00:49:31.385
You guys spend more time
rolling on the ground than running.

00:49:31.468 --> 00:49:35.555
I'm glad I escaped this hellhole quickly.
Right, Seong-jun?

00:49:40.769 --> 00:49:43.480
How are you feeling?
Are you still confident?

00:49:43.563 --> 00:49:44.815
Of course.

00:49:44.898 --> 00:49:48.735
Then go for a try with these kids.

00:49:50.737 --> 00:49:53.323
Guys, good luck. Hanyang High, let's go!

00:49:59.329 --> 00:50:01.081
- Hanyang.
- Yes.

00:50:03.875 --> 00:50:07.921
From now on, let's play real rugby.

00:50:11.133 --> 00:50:14.010
We'll change the defensive position.
Seong-jun will mark No. 7.

00:50:14.094 --> 00:50:15.470
When No. 6 penetrates,

00:50:15.554 --> 00:50:17.764
Ju-yang will block him and slow him down.

00:50:18.348 --> 00:50:20.058
- Then Tae-pung will do the rest.
- Okay.

00:50:20.142 --> 00:50:21.768
Yeong-gwang, when you get the ball,

00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:24.187
kick it far into the empty space
on their side.

00:50:24.271 --> 00:50:26.189
- Even if my teammates are far away?
- Yes.

00:50:26.273 --> 00:50:28.150
You can never predict a rugby ball.

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.111
There's always a chance to grab it.

00:50:34.239 --> 00:50:35.365
- And Myeong-u.
- Yes.

00:50:35.449 --> 00:50:36.616
- Seon-ho.
- Yes.

00:50:36.700 --> 00:50:38.702
Fight hard against the opponents.

00:50:38.785 --> 00:50:40.203
Push hard and stand strong.

00:50:40.287 --> 00:50:41.538
- Hold your ground.
- Okay.

00:50:42.122 --> 00:50:43.957
- Hyeong-sik.
- Yes.

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.084
More than half of their points

00:50:46.168 --> 00:50:49.504
came while you were off the field
for those two minutes.

00:50:50.172 --> 00:50:52.758
We'll never win if players
lose their cool on the field.

00:50:53.341 --> 00:50:54.176
Yes, sir.

00:50:55.469 --> 00:50:57.971
We lost 35 points in the first half.

00:50:59.181 --> 00:51:00.348
It's okay if we can't score.

00:51:01.224 --> 00:51:03.935
We'll play a defensive game
in the second half.

00:51:04.936 --> 00:51:07.522
- Hanyang High, let's go.
- Let's go.

00:51:07.606 --> 00:51:08.940
- Go get 'em.
- Let's go.

00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:11.318
Let's go.

00:51:11.985 --> 00:51:13.111
- Go.
- There's no defense.

00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:17.240
We have to move up.

00:51:17.324 --> 00:51:18.325
Catch him.

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:23.038
Hurry. Here.

00:51:23.121 --> 00:51:24.623
Hurry and get them.

00:51:24.706 --> 00:51:26.374
Release the ball.

00:51:43.809 --> 00:51:44.810
Sure.

00:51:44.893 --> 00:51:47.646
You can take the extra step.
But you'll just get pushed back.

00:51:47.729 --> 00:51:50.607
Don't give an inch.

00:51:59.324 --> 00:52:00.242
Set!

00:52:06.164 --> 00:52:07.874
Push.

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.016
We did it!

00:52:26.351 --> 00:52:29.312
Hey, Coach Kim. Why…
Why are they suddenly losing ground?

00:52:29.396 --> 00:52:30.438
I'm sorry.

00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:35.235
Here.

00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:36.653
Myeong-u, here!

00:52:37.571 --> 00:52:38.488
Yeong-gwang!

00:52:39.322 --> 00:52:40.740
Yeong-gwang.

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:43.785
That's it. Look forward.

00:52:44.828 --> 00:52:45.996
Hey, Tae-pung.

00:52:46.079 --> 00:52:46.997
Run.

00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:47.998
Run!

00:53:04.222 --> 00:53:06.600
- Hey, Seon-ho.
- Look at me.

00:53:06.683 --> 00:53:08.351
What's wrong?

00:53:08.435 --> 00:53:09.769
His nose is bleeding. Hurry.

00:53:09.853 --> 00:53:11.021
- Nosebleed.
- Time off!

00:53:11.104 --> 00:53:12.105
Hanyang, let's hurry.

00:53:12.188 --> 00:53:13.899
Why is his nose bleeding?

00:53:13.982 --> 00:53:15.275
- Did you elbow him?
- Stop it.

00:53:15.358 --> 00:53:16.484
Hey!

00:53:16.568 --> 00:53:17.986
He's bleeding. What are you doing?

00:53:18.069 --> 00:53:20.322
- Get out.
- Stop it.

00:53:20.405 --> 00:53:21.948
- Seon-ho, are you all right?
- Yes.

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:34.169
I'm sure he elbowed him.

00:53:35.378 --> 00:53:37.130
What the heck are you doing?!

00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:39.299
Are you kidding me?

00:53:39.966 --> 00:53:42.844
How could you not score
against those losers in the second half?

00:53:43.428 --> 00:53:44.429
Are you exhausted?

00:53:44.512 --> 00:53:46.473
Should I replace you, U-jae?

00:53:46.556 --> 00:53:48.183
Geez.

00:53:48.266 --> 00:53:49.309
You're doing well.

00:53:49.392 --> 00:53:50.560
We lost the first half.

00:53:50.644 --> 00:53:52.646
But the second half is still at 0 to 0.

00:53:52.729 --> 00:53:53.688
SECOND HALF 00 : 00

00:53:53.772 --> 00:53:55.440
We have three minutes left.

00:53:55.523 --> 00:53:57.359
We'll score a try every minute.

00:53:58.026 --> 00:53:59.945
If you can't,
you'll have nighttime training.

00:54:00.028 --> 00:54:00.904
Okay?

00:54:00.987 --> 00:54:02.864
- Yes, sir!
- Go on then, you pricks.

00:54:02.948 --> 00:54:03.782
In the second half…

00:54:05.325 --> 00:54:06.952
Is there any way to win?

00:54:21.633 --> 00:54:23.593
The defensive play stops now.

00:54:23.677 --> 00:54:27.055
From now on, we'll play to win.

00:54:36.022 --> 00:54:37.565
- Get it out.
- Nice.

00:54:39.901 --> 00:54:40.902
Go forward.

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.282
Tackle him.

00:54:48.118 --> 00:54:49.452
- Tackle!
- You bastards!

00:54:49.536 --> 00:54:51.496
- Get your head in the game!
- Look ahead.

00:54:52.747 --> 00:54:54.165
- Seon-ho.
- Ju-yang!

00:54:54.249 --> 00:54:56.626
Hey!

00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:58.253
- Pass it.
- Keep running.

00:54:58.878 --> 00:54:59.963
Get it out.

00:55:01.423 --> 00:55:03.299
- Catch it quickly.
- Move forward.

00:55:03.383 --> 00:55:05.593
You want me to pass it
to Yeong-gwang at the back?

00:55:05.677 --> 00:55:06.803
That's right.

00:55:06.886 --> 00:55:09.139
Yeong-gwang will move toward Tae-pung.

00:55:09.222 --> 00:55:10.056
Hey, catch it.

00:55:16.062 --> 00:55:18.314
<i>Seong-jun and Tae-pung will spread out.</i>

00:55:18.898 --> 00:55:19.941
<i>Then their defense…</i>

00:55:20.025 --> 00:55:21.317
Here.

00:55:21.401 --> 00:55:22.902
They'll focus on Tae-pung.

00:55:22.986 --> 00:55:26.823
Then, even if Yeong-gwang kicks the ball,
Tae-pung's going to be blocked.

00:55:27.407 --> 00:55:29.034
- Run!
- Run!

00:55:29.117 --> 00:55:30.827
Nice kick. Run!

00:55:30.910 --> 00:55:31.953
Stop him, morons.

00:55:32.037 --> 00:55:32.871
Run.

00:55:33.788 --> 00:55:34.622
Go.

00:55:34.706 --> 00:55:35.999
Run. Faster.

00:55:36.082 --> 00:55:40.420
<i>Then Yeong-gwang will kick the ball</i>
<i>toward Seong-jun.</i>

00:55:40.503 --> 00:55:41.921
Okay. Let's go.

00:55:50.472 --> 00:55:51.306
Run.

00:55:52.307 --> 00:55:53.975
Think of it as your last sprint.

00:55:54.059 --> 00:55:55.310
Go!

00:55:55.393 --> 00:55:56.728
Run!

00:55:59.606 --> 00:56:04.110
<i>You'd understand if you've ever tried</i>
<i>catching a flying rugby ball.</i>

00:56:05.987 --> 00:56:09.365
<i>Its trajectory is just impossible</i>
<i>to predict.</i>

00:56:11.409 --> 00:56:12.452
<i>That's why</i>

00:56:13.161 --> 00:56:16.998
<i>you score a try, not a goal, in rugby.</i>

00:56:18.166 --> 00:56:21.252
<i>It's a nod to all the attempts and efforts</i>

00:56:21.336 --> 00:56:27.509
<i>made to catch a ball that bounces</i>
<i>in completely unpredictable ways.</i>

00:56:28.843 --> 00:56:32.472
<i>That's why rugby isn't about</i>
<i>the final result.</i>

00:56:33.223 --> 00:56:36.017
<i>It's about the process of pushing</i>
<i>and challenging yourself.</i>

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:40.063
<i>It's about the process of pushing forward,</i>

00:56:41.022 --> 00:56:43.900
<i>no matter how many obstacles</i>
<i>or tackles you face along the way.</i>

00:57:10.385 --> 00:57:11.344
<i>This is why</i>

00:57:12.846 --> 00:57:14.472
<i>we play rugby.</i>

00:57:16.141 --> 00:57:17.809
HANYANG 05 : 00 DAESANG

00:57:23.481 --> 00:57:27.152
NO SIDE: A RUGBY TERM
THAT ANNOUNCES THE END OF A GAME

00:57:27.235 --> 00:57:28.069
Darn it.

00:57:31.197 --> 00:57:34.576
Seong-jun!

00:57:34.659 --> 00:57:36.911
Hanyang High's Rugby Team!

00:57:46.171 --> 00:57:48.214
We did it!

00:58:05.773 --> 00:58:07.942
Coach!

00:58:16.451 --> 00:58:17.827
We won!

00:58:17.911 --> 00:58:19.162
We did it!

00:58:19.245 --> 00:58:21.289
What in the world?

00:58:21.372 --> 00:58:24.083
Captain, how does it feel to lose well?

00:58:25.418 --> 00:58:26.461
Well…

00:58:27.128 --> 00:58:28.046
It's not too bad.

00:58:28.838 --> 00:58:30.048
Come on. Spin.

00:58:48.233 --> 00:58:50.235
EPILOGUE

00:58:51.611 --> 00:58:52.529
Yes, Coach.

00:58:53.530 --> 00:58:56.449
Okay. I'll think about it
and call you back.

00:59:04.165 --> 00:59:04.999
Tae-pung.

00:59:10.129 --> 00:59:12.924
HANYANG PHYSICAL EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL

00:59:14.717 --> 00:59:16.010
I'm going to transfer.

00:59:16.844 --> 00:59:18.846
Coach Kim Min-jung gave me an offer.

00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:27.689
What's your reason?

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:30.525
You already know.

00:59:31.651 --> 00:59:34.028
Hanyang High's Rugby Team is hopeless.

00:59:34.862 --> 00:59:37.407
They got excited over scoring one try.

00:59:37.490 --> 00:59:38.741
There are no bench members.

00:59:38.825 --> 00:59:41.160
And half of them are third-year students.

00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:45.748
Will there even be a team
after they graduate?

00:59:48.126 --> 00:59:51.087
Well, we'll need to recruit new students.

00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:53.047
I was the only new recruit this year.

00:59:53.715 --> 00:59:55.216
Who would apply to a team…

00:59:56.884 --> 00:59:58.886
that couldn't even win once?

01:00:05.351 --> 01:00:06.686
There's no future here.

01:00:18.489 --> 01:00:21.075
Come on. That's just your opinion.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:23.453
It is.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.675
Okay. I got it.

01:00:41.387 --> 01:00:42.555
You did a good job.

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:51.856
Right!

01:00:52.690 --> 01:00:56.736
You tend to overwork your ankles
when you make a turn.

01:00:56.819 --> 01:00:58.655
It's because your ankles aren't balanced.

01:00:58.738 --> 01:00:59.739
Do balance training.

01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:04.494
If you use your ankles like that,
you can't play for a long time. Okay?

01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:02.969
THE WINNING TRY

01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:06.055
<i>As long as Ju Ga-ram is the coach,</i>
<i>they'll never recruit a new player.</i>

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:08.099
This will disband the team for sure.

01:02:08.182 --> 01:02:09.475
<i>- Let's go destroy him.</i>
<i>- Let's go.</i>

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:10.893
Stop right there!

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:12.729
- Are you a boomer?
- That's one of my charms.

01:02:12.812 --> 01:02:15.606
<i>So he's a soon-to-be school coach?</i>

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:18.401
You can't come back
after leaving like that. No way.

01:02:18.484 --> 01:02:20.570
<i>I knew I'd end up like this.</i>

01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:21.612
I think he ran away.

01:02:21.696 --> 01:02:24.157
Last time, your captain went missing.
This time, your coach.

01:02:26.033 --> 01:02:27.910
<i>Don't worry. It's me, Ju Ga-ram.</i>

01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:30.705
<i>If he brings one player</i>
<i>that can pass the skill test,</i>

01:02:30.788 --> 01:02:32.540
<i>it could delay the disbandment.</i>

01:02:32.623 --> 01:02:35.293
It's you. Mun Ung!

01:02:39.672 --> 01:02:41.674
