00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.320
Mr. Lin,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.840
before we begin

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.680
the new show,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.640
I wanna

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.759
settle the cut.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.759
Your terms

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:00.840
are fine with me.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.520
It's in process.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.720
I was planning

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.800
to talk to you

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.800
regarding the new show.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.479
We think

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.680
you need a co-host.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.680
Two hosts?

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.280
Who do you have

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.760
in mind?

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.600
Zhang Ran's been killing it lately.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.720
Getting her involved

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.440
would take the show

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.800
to the next level.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.079
Next level...

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.320
Look,

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:38.920
I've always

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.640
handled these shows

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.920
myself.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.240
Adding someone

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.079
feels like

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.320
you're

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.520
taking my project away.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.560
Plus, you haven't even

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.000
given me a good reason.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.200
Consider this,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.079
her popularity

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:57.800
would

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.560
boost your numbers.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.280
The show would reach

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.520
new heights.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.760
This project

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.360
is my creation,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.600
my own initiative.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.240
You can't

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.560
swoop in and take over.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.320
While it's your creation,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.760
it's also a company asset.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.360
We all want it

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.480
to succeed.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.280
You wanna do things

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.040
your way,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.280
but we need to think about

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.600
what's best

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.560
for the show.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.920
This is ridiculous!

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.440
I've given

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.960
everything to this project!

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.440
My team and I

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.680
have handled everything

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.320
for six months,

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.800
from concept

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.440
to investors

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.200
to sponsors.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.920
You're just stealing it!

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.320
How dare you?

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.800
Trust me,

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.720
I've already

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:59.960
got the investors on board.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.240
Call them if you wanna check.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.880
Don't be upset.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.360
We go way back.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.320
If you're really against it,

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.680
I won't push.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.240
But changing plans

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.600
means a lot of explaining

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.560
to investors.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.200
Who knows if

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.320
they'll stick around.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.720
Here,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.440
take a sip.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.240
People are watching.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.560
Gimme an out.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:02.680
Please.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.280
Smooth move.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.400
We appreciate it!

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.240
Thanks!

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.720
That's our star!

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.440
Let's hear it!

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.760
Alright,

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.480
enough clapping.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.080
We're all working for Mr. Lin.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.600
Whatever he decides,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.960
we follow.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.040
I'm grateful

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.760
for your investment in me.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:41.320
Whatever you say!

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.280
Everyone,

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.880
coffee's on me!

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.920
Thank you all!

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.200
Thanks!

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:49.560
Good luck, Zhang Ran!

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.600
You too...

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.400
Need to talk.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.000
Sure.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.800
Just go.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.080
Why's she getting

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.320
called in?

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.840
What happened?

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.280
Zhang Ran,

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.760
have a sandwich.

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.880
Already ate,

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.800
please, help yourself.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.360
It'll go bad soon.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.120
We're thinking of

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.840
putting you on Lin Anran's show.

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:36.280
Thoughts?

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.000
I appreciate the opportunity,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.520
but I'm concerned.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:40.680
Afterall,

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.159
this show

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:43.440
is her creation.

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:45.760
Joining now

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.520
seems like I'm...

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.680
piggy-backing on her success.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.200
It's important she knows,

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.680
every opportunity comes from the company.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.320
All decisions are about

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.640
what's best for business.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.080
Got it.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.080
But this isn't

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.920
my wheelhouse.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.440
No real experience here.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.560
Don't wanna be dead weight.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.240
Being an influencer

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.640
isn't like your hosting gig.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.480
There's more flexibility.

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.760
Don't see this

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:19.280
as a promotion,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.280
you've earned it.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.080
Truth is,

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.680
I see a brighter future

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.559
in you.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.720
That's a lot of pressure.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.280
Take it easy.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.120
Actually getting hungry now.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:44.560
C'mon.

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:45.600
Thanks.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.080
Better eat it before

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:48.760
it expires.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:51.920
Boss,

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.800
you're so generous.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.160
Really.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:56.640
Thank you!

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.240
Um... maybe

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.880
I'll... eat it in my office?

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:06.960
Thanks, boss.

Mr. Li!

Morning, Mr. Li.

Mr. Li!

Mr. Li.

[Market penetration?]

[Or branding strategy?]

[pushed people away.]

become a figurehead.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:49.000
Got it, Mr. Xing.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:51.320
Whatever you say.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.120
[Yeah,]

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.480
[hit "Follow" up top!]

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:13.920
[Please,]

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.000
[like]

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.800
[and subscribe]

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.400
[if you enjoy the stream!]

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.000
Mr. Lin!

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:20.240
Here.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.440
Everyone!

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.000
Gather around!

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.800
C'mon!

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.160
Guys, here!

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.160
Everyone gather around!

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.040
Take five!

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.240
Come here!

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.240
An announcement.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:45.680
Alright!

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.640
First off,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.320
really big thanks

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.160
to your hard work.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:58.920
We've made the leap

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:01.840
from short videos and streams

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.520
to full-length content.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.280
And major props

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.560
to our star, our ace,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.800
Ms. Lin Anran!

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.320
She's the compass

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.880
guiding our vessel!

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.760
Zhang Ran, come up here.

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.440
Her recent dedication

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:49.080
has made her

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.560
a rising star.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.960
Her go-getter attitude

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.400
sets an example for us.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.600
Long road ahead, folks.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.400
If your stats aren't perfect,

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.040
don't look for excuses.

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.560
Our mission is crucial.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:13.680
We're shaping culture,

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.200
driving the economy.

00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.480
We're

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.440
the industry's pioneers!

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.000
That window

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.960
in my office?

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.440
Every day

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.120
I watch you streaming,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.840
it warms my heart!

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.080
Seeing those numbers light up the screen,

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:33.440
I tear up.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.680
Every one of you

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:37.760
has made

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.040
the company what it is.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.920
We're so grateful.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:52.800
So

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:57.040
the management and Anran

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.880
have decided to

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:01.680
bring Zhang Ran into the new show.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.960
It'll create more buzz,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:07.800
break new ground!

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.480
Bravo!

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.040
The show isn't individual property,

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.560
it's a collective asset.

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.319
Everyone gets their shot!

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:30.080
I'm confident these two

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.880
will create

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:34.560
amazing synergy together.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:35.880
Thanks, Anran.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.160
Let's soar together.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.360
Together!

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:44.720
Hi!

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:52.680
Great effort, folks!

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.520
Appreciate it!

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:53.960
Thanks!

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.720
Thanks!

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.360
More spacious here.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.480
Definitely bigger, right?

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.040
From a cubbyhole to a palace.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.080
Over here.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.200
Suite has a minimum spend of 680.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.440
680?

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.840
680's fine

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.960
for two.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.160
On you anyway.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.400
Suite's overkill for two!

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:37.320
You're buying then!

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.880
C'mon...

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.440
you promised...

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.040
A toast!

00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:41.880
The team has been

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.840
exceptional lately.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.720
Tonight's on me!

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:47.920
Lost my appetite.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:48.400
You?

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.800
One minute he's starving,

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.160
the next he's not!

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.200
Can't figure this guy out!

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.720
Good night.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:12.760
Now what?

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:14.360
Just go, okay?

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.840
Look at us,

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.800
like these lions,

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.520
fancy titles

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:19.760
but

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.280
no substance!

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.520
Like seeks like.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:29.480
Get in!

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:30.560
Not leaving.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.160
Fine, I will.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:32.800
No, you're not.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:33.920
What?

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:34.800
Dinner, of course!

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.240
Why should we

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.120
back down?

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:37.880
In there!

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:38.920
C'mon!

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.320
Sorry, we'll stay.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:43.960
Go!

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:46.560
Why'd you bolt

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.520
if we're staying?

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.320
You bolted!

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.600
That was all you!

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:50.480
You started it!

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.320
You're right here,

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:51.680
waitress there...

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.040
Dude, you totally bolted.

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.160
Then you just...

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.280
Still a suite?

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.600
Main hall's fine.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.160
Alright.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.280
Over here.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.200
Here's the menu,

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:14.960
let me know.

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:15.880
Thanks.

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.080
This is power move.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.600
Eating right here!

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.400
By sitting here,

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:24.760
we've already conceded.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.160
See the big picture!

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:27.760
Us out here

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.120
beats their suite.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:31.800
All part of the plan.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:32.960
How's that?

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.120
Staff in the suite

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.840
while the bosses here?

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.720
Rather awkward

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.120
for them, right?

00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:44.040
Let's order.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.000
That thing's in the way.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.480
Let's move it!

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
Don't make this weirder.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.280
It's stuck.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:00.640
What to order?

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:02.840
Anything goes.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.480
Can't go on.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.080
About to burst.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.520
Bounce?

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.920
We're just warming up.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.240
Notice something?

00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.920
Not one

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.800
bathroom break

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:16.240
from there.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:17.760
They've spotted us

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:19.040
and are too chicken

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.320
to come out.

00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.560
All of them holding it in,

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:22.680
got it?

00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.240
Watch them squirm.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:25.880
What now?

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.000
Keep eating.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.960
So it's either outlast them

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.920
or burst trying?

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.960
They'll break first.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:36.640
C'mon, cheers!

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.160
Excuse me,

00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:38.200
menu!

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:38.800
On it!

00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.240
Order anything you like,

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.120
go wild!

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.200
Cheers,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.680
guys!

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:11.480
Time to go!

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.400
Watch the tipsy ones!

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:16.080
Watch it!

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.400
Check, please.

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.560
Mr. Li, Mr. Fu!

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.640
Hey! Fancy seeing you here.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.040
Small world.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.280
Indeed!

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.040
Mr. Li's here too.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.680
Michael!

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.040
Mr. Li,

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:37.000
Mr. Fu...

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.760
didn't expect to run into you.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.120
Just grabbing a bite.

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.000
Talk about timing!

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.200
Yeah, yeah!

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.360
Everyone's been

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.560
putting in long hours,

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:45.920
so I took the team out.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.480
Would've invited

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.240
you both,

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.280
but didn't wanna put you

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.560
in an awkward spot.

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.720
Right,

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.000
you'd be more relaxed

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.040
without us.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.520
Thank you for your...

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.040
You've been through a lot lately.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.760
You deserve this.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.840
It's on me!

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:04.480
You guys head out.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.400
No! Mr. Li!

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.560
We're still a startup.

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.520
Can't spend company fund.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.200
I got this, really.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:09.920
Not company money,

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:10.960
from my own pocket!

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.240
To show appreciation.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:14.880
Mr. Li and Mr. Fu

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.840
are buying dinner!

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:16.960
Thank you so much!

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:17.560
Don't

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.480
mention it,

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.320
you guys earned it!

00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:19.960
So,

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:20.800
any words from the bosses?

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:22.760
Nah, get going!

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.520
Get some rest!

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:24.600
OK, we're off then.

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:24.840
Sure.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.520
Take care.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.000
Thanks.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:26.480
Later!

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.160
Bye!

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.280
All that waiting

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.360
just to hear them vent?

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.880
They had a blast!

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.280
So much for being embarrassed.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.520
Mere surface pleasantries.

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.200
They're awkward within.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:50.760
You felt

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.760
that tension, right?

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.280
Mission accomplished!

00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.040
Totally...

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:04.280
Wonder what their tab came to.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.400
How bad could it be?

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.600
What happened to

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:18.520
our after-dinner walk?

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:19.520
You're practically running.

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.480
I'm getting cramps.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.480
Keep this up

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.160
and dinner's

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.400
coming back up.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.800
What are we even doing?

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:35.880
The company's turned into

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:36.760
something different from

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.520
what we dreamed up.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:39.600
What choice do we have?

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:40.840
It is what it is.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.440
Gotta roll with it.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:44.880
Damn,

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:46.360
these guys

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.680
racked up almost ten grand!

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:49.560
Wish I'd known they'd pig out

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:50.760
before offering to treat.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:51.800
So pissed!

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:53.680
Bright side,

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.640
you just saved

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.000
ten grand for the company.

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.320
Always Mr. Silver Lining, huh?

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:00.680
How about

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.680
we talk to Xing Kai?

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.480
About what?

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.600
"Dr. Fu" has gone

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.640
completely off the rails.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:05.760
Keep this up,

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:06.880
and I'm done.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:11.000
Not this again.

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:14.200
Listen, I get you,

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.280
but this whole work thing?

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.640
It's all an act.

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:18.880
Everyone's in it.

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:20.880
Xing Kai's playing investor,

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.360
and Michael,

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.760
he's playing a smart dude.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:24.560
It's just about

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.640
picking your role.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:27.840
Plus, we're

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:29.480
strapped into this ride now.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.600
Can't bail

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:32.800
halfway through.

00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.760
Gotta tough it out.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:40.560
Let's go!

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:42.960
Really got a cramp?

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.720
Yeah.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:44.240
Follow me.

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.920
Slow down!

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:49.880
Slowing down

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:50.800
makes it worse.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.160
Just pick up the pace...

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:53.120
Fine, faster!

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.400
C'mon, move it!

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.360
Is that cramp real?

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.000
Totally!

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.320
Dude, you suck!

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.440
Why even sub you in?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:11.920
Should've left you out.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.320
God...

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.280
Oh yeah,

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.400
perfect!

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.160
Nice!

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:29.960
Awesome!

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.440
See.

00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.920
That's how it's done.

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.840
Hey, don't nuke

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.840
everything.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.240
Leave a few, Bo.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.040
Eating like a queen.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:47.840
What about Yudong?

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:48.720
Why didn't you ask him?

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.040
No use trying.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.800
He's all big boss now,

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.920
always tied up.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:54.880
Doing who knows what.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.360
Yeah,

00:27:58.840 --> 00:27:59.400
hey,

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.320
look at this mess.

00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:01.760
What?

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:03.120
They're trash-talking you.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.000
I tried to fight back

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.840
but these move too fast.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.000
Can't keep up.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.120
Just report them!

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:11.560
Don't

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.840
concern yourselves!

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.000
Go on,

00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.440
report them.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:16.320
Outrageous!

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.760
Boss said it today,

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:18.840
you only get haters

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.920
when you're hot.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:22.480
Nobody bothers with nobodies.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.120
I know exactly who it is,

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.320
our competitors.

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.520
Playing dirty.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:31.160
Liu Bo's

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:32.040
handling it for me,

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:32.600
don't sweat it.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.400
Got a team for this.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.960
Liu Bo deals with

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:36.920
the comments, reports,

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.720
all that jazz.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.120
Mom, for real,

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:40.120
I'm blowing up.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.760
This afternoon at work

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.600
was insane, you know.

00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:46.920
My boss had everyone

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:47.560
line up

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:48.600
and clap for me.

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.560
I'm bringing in the big bucks!

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:51.720
Really?

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:53.600
I'm on fire!

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:54.720
Straight

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.880
to the top!

00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.240
I'll be the queen bee in no time!

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.360
Here we go again.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.800
Just stating facts.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.960
Your dad's still in there.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.800
Bet his legs are gonna

00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.200
go dead.

00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.720
He's like a bathroom hermit.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:12.520
Why does

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.000
he camp out in there?

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.200
Get him out!

00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.920
Dad, we're going to bed!

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:22.200
Food's ready!

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.480
Coming!

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.240
Every single day,

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.280
no wonder Mom

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:27.040
gives you grief.

00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:29.200
Even strangers would set you straight.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.520
I'm good.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.240
Spot-on impression

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.160
of that

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.000
crutch salesman.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.440
Just like him.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.120
Gotta change that toilet seat.

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.520
Hard on butt

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.640
and freezing cold.

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.760
Takes forever to warm up.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:53.640
I'll get you a new one.

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:57.880
That heated toilet seat

00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.320
Lady Wan was selling?

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:01.800
Imported!

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:02.640
So nice!

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.080
But your mom shot it down.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:07.480
Listen to you,

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.000
"Lady Wan."

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.080
You don't even

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:10.640
talk that sweet

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.720
to your actual sister.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.760
Such a dinosaur.

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.600
She doesn't know anything.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.320
Oh, you're up on Lady Wan!

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.280
Impressive!

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.320
So what?

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.440
I'm even part of

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.360
her fan community!

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.240
Just eat, will you?

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.600
Stick to

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.600
being Mom's fan.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:29.080
No thanks.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.560
See?

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.960
She kicked me out of

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:33.520
her fan club

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.720
and blocked me!

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.160
You're getting famous,

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.160
I'll be your fan.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:37.760
Sure.

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.200
Some place you picked...

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:21.200
our legs are gonna die.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.720
What's the deal

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.480
with this

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.160
sitting style?

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.320
Just wanna treat you

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.400
like a VIP.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.320
Here,

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.680
a little something!

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:31.400
You laid them?

00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.480
Stress balls.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.560
Get stressed? Just squeeze.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.400
Yeah, I know these.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.360
Spill it, what's up?

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.040
OK.

00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:41.680
Got a tiny favor

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:42.560
to ask.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:43.120
Make it snappy,

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.520
time is money.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.520
You're

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:47.000
a big shot influencer now,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:47.440
right?

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.040
Yup.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.480
You've got connections.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.480
Any way

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.880
you could hook us up

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.920
with Lady Wan?

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.760
Maybe

00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.640
get her contact info?

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.480
If we could

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.000
partner up...

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.560
with our products...

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:02.400
we could really...

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:04.240
That's all?

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:05.520
Please?

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.200
Why didn't Fu Yudong

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.560
just ask me himself?

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.320
You know how he is

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.280
about these...

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:11.760
right?

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.000
Feels like getting special treatment?

00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:15.120
Jeez,

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.520
when's he gonna

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.000
start thinking straight?

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.200
She scared me!

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.480
A ghost, huh?

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.000
Yeah, he's just...

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.440
forget it, let's drop it.

00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.360
Drop it?

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.120
He's my husband, c'mon!

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.200
He's just impossible.

00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:30.480
I just... anyway,

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.120
didn't even bring it up.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.840
Like before,

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.240
I said let's get gifts,

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.600
one for his dad,

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.640
one for your mom.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.880
Asked him to deliver them,

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.440
but no, such a pain.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.560
Had to use delivery

00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:43.280
in the end.

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:45.120
What's the deal?

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:45.960
What's this

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.280
deep grudge about?

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:49.200
They're family.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.400
Stay out of their mess,

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.600
seriously.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.040
It's beyond fixing.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.600
Gotta fix it somehow.

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:56.480
This isn't some

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.480
random person off the street,

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.560
nor is it some neighbor,

00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.920
it's his dad!

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.320
They've been together for ages!

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.600
Mom's not just some neighbor either!

00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.040
Exactly!

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:05.560
Why can't he get over it?

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.440
Death is a part of life.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.040
- Right?
- Yeah.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.160
What's wrong with

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.080
finding new love?

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.280
His mom's spirit

00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.320
would get it.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.800
I've talked myself dry,

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:14.800
but he wouldn't listen.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:16.920
No way around it.

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.320
And honestly,

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:19.680
I'm not just running my mouth.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.640
When I married Cheng Man,

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:22.640
I told her straight up,

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.920
if I ever

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.120
end up like that,

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.240
do what his dad did,

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.040
pull the plug.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:29.040
She'll be at peace,

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.040
plus less burden on the family.

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.720
What plug did Uncle Fu pull?

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.040
You don't know?

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:38.960
No.

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:45.760
Let's pretend I was never here.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.640
C'mon, I need to know.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.320
I'm Fu Yudong's wife,

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.360
this concerns me.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.120
Gimme the eggs.

00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.160
They seem poisoned...

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:10.560
Hang on,

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:11.800
calling ambulance.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:14.120
Hello?

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:15.080
OK,

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:16.880
let's make this quick. Gotta run.

00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:20.400
Miracle recovery, huh?

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:23.360
Long story.

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.760
Then make it short.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:26.280
[Yudong,]

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.080
[that upgrade plan]

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.239
[you sent,]

00:34:28.239 --> 00:34:29.480
[had the factory check it out.]

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:31.080
[But look,]

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.280
[the current samples]

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.639
[are killing it,]

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.920
[and the process works fine.]

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.120
[So maybe]

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.199
[let's put this stuff]

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.199
[on ice,]

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:40.719
[yeah?]

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:42.679
[Daoji told me]

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.520
[you guys don't wanna be figureheads.]

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.360
[Frankly, stay in your lane,]

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.639
[that's key,]

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:50.880
[isn't it?]

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.000
Fu Yudong...

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.560
Sleeping.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:15.960
We're good together,

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.800
aren't we?

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:21.600
Yeah.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.160
If I go before you

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.320
someday,

00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:27.680
what would you do?

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:30.600
Cut it out

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.920
with this crazy talk.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.520
Just sleep.

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.080
Death's just

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.720
part of life, yeah?

00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:37.960
If I

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.360
leave first,

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.880
promise me

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.080
you'll take care of yourself.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:43.800
I mean it.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.080
Won't happen

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.840
on my watch.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:49.880
Even if you

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.320
jumped off a cliff,

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.520
I'd kick you back up.

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:54.960
You're not Superman.

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.320
If I got something

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.280
incurable,

00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:58.960
what could you possibly do?

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.360
What did my dad tell you?

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.680
I was too curious,

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:13.640
asked Li Daoji,

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:15.880
and he told me everything

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:17.480
about you and your dad.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:23.600
Zhang Ran,

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.080
you're a terrible liar, y'know?

00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:29.480
I'm not lying.

00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:34.480
Truth is,

00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.440
before coming back,

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.280
I didn't think

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.280
much of your dad either.

00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.440
Don't wanna talk about it.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.560
After I came back

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:50.840
and met him,

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.760
he seems nice.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.440
Not like what you think

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:56.320
or what you've said.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.640
So I really wanna know

00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.960
what's your trigger,

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.040
what's this thing

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:01.720
you can't get past?

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.760
We're married,

00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:05.480
please open up to me.

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.520
Tell me,

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:08.440
and once I get it,

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.320
I'll stop wondering.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.520
Can we drop this?

00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.280
Let's sleep.

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.200
Don't wanna talk about it.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:21.520
Honey,

00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:24.040
this thing's

00:37:24.040 --> 00:37:25.440
been eating at you

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.440
for years,

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.680
I get why you can't move on.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:29.440
But sometimes

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.440
when I look at your dad...

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.200
When he had to

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:33.680
pull her plug,

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.360
wasn't that...

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:34.960
That's enough!

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.960
A tough call for him?

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:40.400
This isn't your business.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:42.880
You don't get to make peace for me.

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.000
I'm not trying to.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.160
This is just what I think.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:47.640
Is that wrong?

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.480
Why are you being such a coward?

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.800
He's your flesh and blood.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.840
He's your dad!

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.000
Your own father!

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.880
I just want peace

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.880
between you and your dad,

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:58.840
Is that so wrong?

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.320
Don't need peace with him,

00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:00.720
alright?

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:01.640
What do you need then?

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.720
Tell me.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:05.040
You've done this

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:05.840
multiple times.

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:06.760
I've told you,

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.520
this ain't your

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.200
business.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.400
But you keep

00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.480
pushing,

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:13.480
I'll say it one last time,

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.760
anything about my mom

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.160
is off limits, got it!

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:23.640
Alright, Fu Yudong.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.080
I won't bring up your mom.

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:27.600
I've been trying to

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.560
change myself lately,

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.240
and suddenly

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.600
everything just clicked.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.120
You just won't make an effort

00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:33.480
to make a change.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.440
You're scared to face things!

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.280
With your dad,

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.280
your family stuff,

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.360
moving back to Canada,

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:43.600
even your work,

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.760
it's always been this same issue!

00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.640
Life's full of stuff

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.720
we don't wanna

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.040
deal with,

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.760
but you gotta change to make it.

00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:50.480
I know

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:51.760
you hate hearing this,

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.720
but you know

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:53.320
I'm right.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.200
Are you doing this for me?

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:56.200
Aren't I?

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.120
You're trying to show off

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.080
how good you are.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:58.680
Fu Yudong...

00:38:58.680 --> 00:38:59.800
Problems nobody else can fix,

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.000
You just wave your magic wand!

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:01.840
Years of

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.040
deep-rooted issues?

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.480
Poof! Gone!

00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.880
My, aren't you just special?

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.280
But I'm telling you!

00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:09.520
About my own stuff,

00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:10.920
I'm saying this seriously,

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.680
one last time!

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.240
Stay out of it!

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.280
Fu Yudong...

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.360
Fu Yudong!

00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:45.920
Fu Yudong?

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.520
Why are you up so early?

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.320
Don't look,

00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.400
you'll ruin the surprise.

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:51.960
What're you making?

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.280
The surprise is gone!

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:53.720
Just one look,

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.520
come on!

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.360
OK, didn't see a thing.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.760
Who was talking to me?

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:06.560
I love you!

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:42.920
Enjoy.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:56.760
Honey, what're you eating?

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.400
Got my own, yeah.

00:41:59.120 --> 00:41:59.640
Let me see.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:01.160
I'll have that.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:01.800
I want it too.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.440
- C'mon!
- I want this.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.600
Always wanting what others have.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.760
You've got your own.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:06.480
If you don't eat it,

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:07.360
I made it for nothing.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.960
This looks a bit raw.

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.200
I like that better. Here.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:11.480
Raw?

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.280
This is Eggs Benedict!

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:13.960
You have no idea

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:14.960
how many eggs

00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.040
I wasted

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.240
making just this one?

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.680
Was trying to show off

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.160
my cooking skills...

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.440
Thanks, babe.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:30.600
Don't spoil

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:31.560
the romantic vibe.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:41.840
Give it back!

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:43.360
I love Chow Fan.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:43.920
That's mine.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:44.400
I can finish it all.

00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.480
Give it back.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.960
Let go. Don't waste it.

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:47.280
Hey...

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:47.840
my cholesterol

00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:49.320
won't go crazy, right?

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:50.440
Maybe for others,

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.080
but not you.

00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:51.600
How come?

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.880
All that shopping,

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.160
racking up those miles,

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.840
you're actually abusing cholesterol!

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:57.280
And you work hard too,

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:57.880
you burn it too.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:42:59.440
Well then,

00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:00.240
this isn't even enough!

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.560
This feels like a skit.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:03.080
Less talking, more eating!

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:03.680
Got cash to chase!

00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.480
This is yours!

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:09.320
Let go!

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.520
Have some bread.

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:17.280
Don't want it.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:17.600
C'mon!
