Gu Nian!

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.840
Gu Nian!

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.920
Gu Nian!

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.599
Gu Nian,

00:01:16.599 --> 00:01:17.719
you destroyed my eye.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.920
You thought I would let you live?

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:26.920
They're blank bullets.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.840
Do you think I'm stupid enough
to give you a gun?

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.040
Now,

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.040
I want you to watch her

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.680
die in front of you.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.480
What are you waiting for?

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:39.599
Beat him to death.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:40.359
Yes, Kun.

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:41.239
K,

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:42.920
enjoy yourself.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:45.519
Qian!

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:47.519
Stop it, you guys!

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:51.599
Qian!

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.480
Kun?

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:01.480
Kun?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.079
Are you okay?

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:04.200
Are you okay?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.640
Gu Nian.

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.360
I'm going to kill you!

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.159
Kun, the police are here!

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:13.319
Let's go.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.400
Go!

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:18.000
Gu Nian, hang in there.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.240

Gu Nian, don't fall asleep.

No!

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.399
(Don't fall for anyone.)

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:48.360
(Or you and those around you
will be in danger.)

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.600
Nian, you're awake.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.319
Wait. I'll call the doctor.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.079
That's great.

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.079
We finally captured
Kun's gang this time.

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:22.920
I believe you'll be back
on the police force soon.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.279
By the way,

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:28.279
what's the exact relationship
between you and Gu Nian?

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:30.800
Don't forget your mission.

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:33.319
Being too deeply involved

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:35.720
is not good for either of you.

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.399
I understand.

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.720
You need to maintain Wei Qing's trust.

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:48.480
At your wedding,

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.839
the chemist will definitely show up.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.680
I can't wait any longer.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.240
I must take initiative.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.480
Why are you in such a hurry?

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.000
Is it for Gu Nian?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.120
No.

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:09.399
Anyway,

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.319
better be careful.

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:17.319
Let's go see Dr. Gu later.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.519
After all, she got hurt because of you.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.800
Okay.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:26.879
Next.

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:32.480
Dr. Gu,

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.000
we haven't come to see you
since you got hurt.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.720
So now we want to check in on you

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:38.680
and get a check-up.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.839
Who needs it?

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.759
It's me.

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:43.879
I'm about to marry Qian.

00:06:43.879 --> 00:06:46.319
So I'm hoping you can help me get ready.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.240
So we can have a cute baby.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.079
I'm a physician.

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:55.120
Not a gynecologist.

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.399
But you're the doctor we know.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.720
Right, Qian?

00:06:59.079 --> 00:06:59.800
Sorry.

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:00.800
We're not that close.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.240
Since Dr. Gu doesn't want to help me,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.040
let's go, Qian.

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:09.439
Wait.

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.519
Don't forget what you promised me.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.879
If you continue to be indecisive,

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:17.600
I'll hand over the recording.

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:19.120
What recording?

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:23.000
I suggest you ask Mr. Song.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.439
(Song Qian, you're a scoundrel.)

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.120
(You need to maintain Wei Qing's trust.)

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:46.800
(If you continue to be indecisive,)

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.480
(I'll hand over the recording.)

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.240
(Come to this place tonight.)

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:12.720
Are you sure Zhao Yan is here?

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.680
I have an appointment
with Zhao Yan here tonight.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.519
I promised him

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:19.040
if he shows up tonight,

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.439
I can keep him safe.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.040
When will Zhao Yan show up?

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.480
Let's wait.

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:39.919
I don't have time
to waste here with you.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:45.440
Are you so impatient with me now?

00:09:04.039 --> 00:09:04.759
After him.

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:06.120
Zhao Yan is over there.

00:09:07.519 --> 00:09:07.840
Hurry!

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.200
He's been hit!

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.679
It's such a mess!

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.320
Zhao Yan!

00:09:19.519 --> 00:09:20.600
Zhao Yan, you can't die.

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:22.120
Zhao Yan, wake up.

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:25.519
You can't die.

00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:27.159
You can't die.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.600
You haven't told me

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.200
the truth about my mother's death.

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:36.039
Song Qian, call an ambulance. Hurry!

00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:40.039
Gu Nian,

00:09:40.519 --> 00:09:41.279
he's dead.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.519
Impossible. I'm a doctor.

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:43.120
He can't die.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:43.720
I can save him.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.480
Calm down.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.399
Let go of me!

00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:46.519
Gu Nian, calm down!

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:47.960
He's already dead.

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:54.240
Why did this happen?

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:57.039
I was so close to knowing the truth.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.120
You're tired.

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:03.440
I'll take you home.

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:06.200
No need.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:06.840
Gu Nian.

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:08.279
Take it easy.

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:09.720
Nian.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.120
Are you okay?

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:12.919
I'm tired.

00:10:13.919 --> 00:10:14.759
Take me home.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:15.240
Okay.

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:32.320
Nian, let me walk you inside.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.039
No, it's fine.

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:36.080
By the way,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.320
how did you know I was there tonight?

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.720
Weiwei told me you went

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:44.720
looking for someone at the bar again.

00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:47.919
I don't want what happened
last time to repeat.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.200
So I went to find you.

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.679
Did you find anything?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.039
Nothing at all.

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:02.720
Nian,

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.120
you seem stressed lately.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.320
Why not come with me
to the medical seminar tomorrow?

00:11:09.159 --> 00:11:10.120
Think of it as relaxing.

00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:11.399
Okay?

00:11:15.039 --> 00:11:15.639
Okay.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
(Why would Zhao Yan give me a card?)

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.399
(What is that sound?)

00:12:21.664 --> 00:12:22.176
(Gu Nian.)

00:12:34.279 --> 00:12:35.320
I don't care who you are.

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:36.919
Get out of my home right now.

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:48.639
Gu Nian!

00:12:50.639 --> 00:12:51.159
How are you?

00:12:52.039 --> 00:12:52.600
Are you okay?

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.960
Are you hurt anywhere?

00:12:57.679 --> 00:12:59.000
Should I call you K

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:01.639
or Song Qian?
