=Love Lurking=

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.920
=Episode 9=

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:48.359
Oh, no!

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:51.520
Boss, are you okay?

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.200
Kill them!

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:09.519
I killed someone.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.519
It's okay now.

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:18.519
Don't be afraid.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.560
It's okay now.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:23.159
Don't be afraid.

00:01:24.599 --> 00:01:25.519
Don't be afraid.

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:33.879
Gu Nian,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.760
get out of here.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.400
Forget everything here.

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.159
Start your life over.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.159
Can't we leave together?

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.879
No.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.719
Neither of you
can leave here alive today.

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:34.880
(Half a year later)

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.479
Nian.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.360
Aside from the nightmares,

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.840
your recovery has been good.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.039
But whenever I pick up a scalpel now,

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.560
I relive that moment I fired the gun.

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.360
It's a residual effect of your PTSD.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.240
Full recovery will take time.

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:04.960
The drug dealers you encountered
six months ago are all dead.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.400
So you don't have to fear anymore.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.879
Nian,

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.120
let's have dinner together tonight.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.280
Probably not.

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:32.000
The dean wants
to talk about my mother with me.

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.639
I'm off.

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:35.080
Wait.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.520
You said that medication
caused hallucinations.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.120
I've changed your prescription.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.680
It should work better.

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:47.199
Thanks, Senior.

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.199
He is your target tonight.

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.479
The dean of Grace Hospital.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.199
The dean isn't taking calls.

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.280
Is he in his office?

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.240
Alright. I'm heading over now.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.879
Sorry.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:14.680
Are you okay?

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.879
Am I hallucinating again?

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.800
Dean, are you inside?

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:32.720
It's Nian.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.439
Help.

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:41.560
Dean, wake up!

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:52.439
Stop.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.360
Or I'll kill you.

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:04.279
Dean, I have a document
requiring your signature.

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:24.000
Nian, you're awake.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.680
The dean? Where's the dean?

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:31.480
We tried resuscitating him.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.800
But he still passed from a heart attack.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.959
A heart attack?

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:38.959
No. I saw the killer.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.120
The dean was murdered.

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:43.680
Miss Gu,

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:46.240
are you sure
you witnessed someone killed the dean?

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.279
I didn't see him commit the murder.

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:52.319
But he was at the scene.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.920
The surveillance?

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.439
We checked the footage.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.319
No one was seen entering
or leaving the dean's office.

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:06.199
Miss Gu, if there truly is a killer,

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.800
you might be in danger.

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:09.879
Please be careful.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.680
Stop. Or I'll kill you.

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:20.279
(Why did that man
sound so much like him?)

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.439
If I had gone
to see the dean earlier that day,

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:29.839
he might not have been killed.

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:32.959
Maybe there was no killer at all.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.680
It could just be hallucinations
from your medication.

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:38.000
Even you don't believe me?

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.279
Nian, that's not what I meant.

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:41.800
I heard the dean was murdered.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.800
Could it be that the dean
offended someone powerful

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.920
like former Dean Gu?

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.879
Didn't Dean Gu kill herself
over bribery charges?

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:50.240
Who knows?

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.600
Her daughter claimed there was a killer.

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:54.959
It seems this time,

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:56.680
Dr. Gu says there's a killer too.

00:06:57.199 --> 00:06:58.560
But they say she's hallucinating.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.120
So her testimony isn't credible.

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:06.040
Don't mind what they say.

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:09.680
By the way, I retrieved your phone.

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:19.600
(This isn't my phone.)

00:07:20.079 --> 00:07:20.680
Dean?

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:22.000
What's wrong, Dean?

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.160
This is the dean's phone.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.399
What did you say?

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.279
(They must've returned the wrong phone.)

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:31.120
The dean isn't taking calls.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.319
Alright. I'm heading over now.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.120
(The dean's line was busy
the entire time.)

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.360
(He was indeed on a call
before the accident.)

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:44.000
The dean refused
to collaborate with the Wei Group.

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:47.759
Could he have offended
the Wei family's new head?

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:48.920
What's his name?

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:50.839
Song Qian?

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:52.839
It's Song Qian, I think.

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:57.199
I heard he's ruthless and cruel.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.920
He killed many people.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.360
