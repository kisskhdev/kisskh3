(Adapted from the novel
"Counterattack" by Chai Ji Dan)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.920
(Episode 14, Get Rid of Your
Sensitive and Inferior Past)

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.680
Dr. Jiang.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.176
- Ms. Mei Li.
- I brought you a spring couplet.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.256
Thank you, Ms. Mei Li.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.240
- Happy New Year, Ms. Mei Li.
- Happy New Year.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.960
Dr. Jiang, why didn't you
go home for New Year?

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.856
During the New Year, I'm
afraid people can't find a doctor,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.000
so I stayed behind,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.120
and let Chubby to go home.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.440
Dr. Jiang, you're so kindhearted.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.840
It's New Year's Eve.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.120
You have to eat dumplings.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.880
- Do you have them?
- Yes.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.120
Don't worry, Ms. Mei Li.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.280
Okay. I'll get going then.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.400
- Bye.
- Okay.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.480
Bye, Ms. Mei Li.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.840
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.040
(Happy New Year, I wish you
fortune! Business Hours Adjustment)

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.600
(Fortune)

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.520
(Fortune)

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.040
- Mom, I'm done pasting them.
- Okay.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.360
When did you buy these clothes?

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.800
Look at you. Your memory
is worse than mine now.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.120
Didn't you buy this for me last month?

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.440
Last month?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Then

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.080
who gave it to you?

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.880
Xiao Chi.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.360
He did?

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.200
Here.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.920
Try it on.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.080
When did you buy it?

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.080
When I was buying clothes for my mom today,

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.880
I bought one for you too.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.240
That day, Xiao Chi even
brought the doctor here.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.600
He said from now on,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.376
the doctor will come to our
house regularly to examine me.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.000
So I won't need to go to the hospital.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.520
Xiao Chi

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.920
really knows how to treat people well.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:23.920
Da Qiong.

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.120
Have you visited his parents?

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.480
I

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.240
I'm asking you.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.240
There's no need for me to do that.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.616
What do you mean?

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.560
Why are you so insensible?

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.240
He's so nice to us.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.736
If you don't visit his parents,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.737
is that appropriate?

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:49.280
I'll go. I'll definitely go.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.376
Well, they're very busy now.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.000
When they're free, I'll definitely go.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.296
You have to. You have to be polite.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.320
Okay.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.216
This is so rare.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.217
- We're all gathered here.
- Happy New Year!

00:03:59.241 --> 00:04:01.121
- We must eat and drink well.
- Happy New Year!

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.760
Don't be shy. Eat up.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.680
This is the umami flavor.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.840
- Eat more.
- Yes.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.120
Here, my nephew.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.280
Let me toast to you.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.536
Uncle.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.560
Here.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.256
You're not young anymore.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.216
- Thank you, Mom.
- I wonder when I will get

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.520
to attend your wedding.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:31.440
What are you talking about?

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.880
Chi Cheng is very popular with the ladies.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.360
So many girls are after him.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.760
Of course he must carefully take his pick.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.160
Am I right?

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.760
Yes.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.040
Me and my big mouth.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.560
Seriously.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.800
Chi Cheng.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.256
Your cousin just bought a new house.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.400
He's about to renovate it.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.800
I heard your friend opened
an art installation company.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.840
I'll have to trouble you
to help decorate it then.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Okay.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.296
Discuss the price among yourselves.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.640
What price?

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.336
He invested in the company.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.360
It's on the house.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.856
You're brilliant.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:10.880
Here.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.800
- Here.
- Here's to you.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.680
All right, on behalf of my family,

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.840
I wish everyone good health
and safety in the new year.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.096
- Here. Let's drink.
- Here.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.960
I wish you good health,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.280
- and beauty!
- And beauty!

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.400
Yuan Duan, may your business prosper,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.960
- and may more money roll in.
- And may more money roll in.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.120
Today,

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.520
I can't even chat for a minute with them.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.520
Da Qiong, how's it going?

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.776
I'm kneading the noodles.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.360
Want to give all my love.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.336
Mrs. Wu.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.360
Happy New Year.

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.280
We were just talking
about you and here you are.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.440
Da Qiong, come on.

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.640
You look so handsome today.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.600
Da Qiong, Xiao Chi is here.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.240
You guys talk. We'll be
eating dumplings soon.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.080
Why are you at my house on New Year's?

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.320
Can I stay now?

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.120
Have a seat.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.680
Here are the dumplings.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.200
Dig in.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.320
Let's eat.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.320
Here, Xiao Chi.

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.120
Thank you, Mrs. Wu.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.456
It's New Year's Eve, if you
don't go home for dinner,

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.200
is your family okay with it?

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.320
There are so many of them.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.640
They don't need me.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.440
In the future, come eat at our house often.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.296
Da Qiong always praises you.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.960
He says you're really nice to him.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:52.680
Okay.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.200
Come on.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.320
Let's drink.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.256
Mom. Don't pour it for
him. He has to drive later.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.536
Call a designated driver.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.200
He rarely comes to our house.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.320
And it's New Year.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.840
How can you not drink a bit?

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.440
At worst,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.600
stay overnight at our house again.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.376
The bed in Da Qiong's room is really big.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.640
You two can roll around
as much as you want.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.840
Thank you, Mrs. Wu.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.377
Slow down.

00:07:17.401 --> 00:07:19.441
- How can you choke while eating?
- Here. Eat this.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.640
We'll roll on the bed later.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.120
Hold it.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.400
Here.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:29.520
Throw it.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.440
That's so exciting.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.480
Here.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
You light one.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.280
Me?

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.040
I don't want to.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.800
It's like a landmine.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.320
It makes this exploding sound.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.120
The kind of fireworks you
play with are for little girls.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.760
This one is so darn manly.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.520
You do it.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:57.376
I'll light it.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.400
Here.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.880
What are you doing?

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.480
- No.
- Don't move.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.376
Don't! Mr. Chi!

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.216
- Throw it.
- Don't panic.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.960
One, two, three, go.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.080
This is exciting.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:15.760
Who is it?

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.320
Food delivery.

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:20.520
I didn't order any food.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.016
What do you think? Are you surprised?

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.080
Is this unexpected?

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.080
Why are you here?

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.760
I'm here to deliver warmth to you.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.760
Otherwise, you'd be
lonely by yourself at home.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:43.920
Right?

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.360
I'm here now.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.096
Are you happy to see me?

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.160
Hey, fox.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.720
Come in for the new year.

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.560
All right, goose.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.816
Let me show you what I can do.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.840
Come on.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.240
Try it.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.960
This was all you had today?

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.736
You're amazing.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:31.760
I'm good, right?

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:49.800
(Mom)

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.760
Since we started cooking,

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.640
your phone has been ringing.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.120
Why don't you go back
to do what you need to do?

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:03.240
All right.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:04.880
I'll get going then.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:05.920
Go.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.736
You don't have to see me out.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:08.760
I'll get going.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.480
I really won't see you out.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.640
All right.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.656
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,
- Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:01.400
- five, four, three, two, one!
- Three, two, one.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.840
Surprise!

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.440
What do you think? You
were surprised, right?

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.560
Actually, I didn't leave at all.

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:12.040
You're an adult.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:13.560
Why do you still do these things?

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.200
Isn't this trick

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.520
used to pacify children?

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:19.920
Come on.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.097
Hurry up.

00:12:21.121 --> 00:12:22.160
Make a wish.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.040
Come on.

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.600
I hope

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:31.640
everything will go smoothly for us.

00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.120
Us?

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.240
Can't you see the meaning?

00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.440
Then tell me.

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.537
What's the meaning?

00:12:44.561 --> 00:12:47.040
Of course it's for things to go well.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:48.720
For things

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.040
to go well.

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:53.120
Eat more then.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.320
You ambushed me.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.320
Eat more.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.040
You.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.200
I'm sorry.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.760
(Darn it, Xiao Shuai.
(Take a look! It's his karma.)

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.560
Yes!

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.240
The exposé at school before

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.960
is all true.

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.640
I don't deserve to be a teacher.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:56.640
For years, I've been
dating many male students

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.920
using my identity as a teacher.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.280
Under the pretext of discussing projects,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.600
I lured them to the office.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.000
I manipulated them.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:09.440
I emotionally abused them.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:12.096
When I got bored, I drugged them,

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.840
and framed them for promiscuity.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.640
After dumping them, I
moved on to the next one.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.680
I'm a jerk.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:19.960
I'm trash.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.280
I, Meng Tao, am not human.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.416
I deserve to go to hell!

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.776
I deserve to go to hell.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.000
I deserve to go to hell.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.640
I deserve to go to hell.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.520
I deserve to go to hell.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.480
I deserve to go to hell.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.400
- I deserve it.
- Come on, Xiao Shuai.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.320
Let's go eat.

00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.560
I deserve to go to hell.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.880
I was wrong.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.600
Darn it. Wasn't he.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.400
I'm a jerk.

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.376
It was him.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.400
It was him.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.280
It was him.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.320
He was my scumbag ex-boyfriend.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:07.600
You can go now.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.320
Come to me if you have any questions.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:10.777
Go on.

00:15:10.801 --> 00:15:12.136
- Bye, Mr. Meng.
- Bye, Mr. Meng.

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.160
Let's go.

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:15.696
- Xiao Shuai.
- Xiao Shuai.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.720
Bye.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.056
How many times have I told you?

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.880
I'm undergoing a
promotion assessment lately.

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:27.640
We have to be careful in school.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.960
Why can't you remember?

00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:31.840
I don't see people here.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.280
So

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.177
Jiang Xiao Shuai.

00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:37.800
I remember when I first met you,

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:40.400
you weren't this careless
and you didn't talk back to me.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.920
What happened to you?

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.760
Meng Tao.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.160
Meng Tao, I didn't do it on purpose.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.360
I'm sorry.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.640
Jiang Xiao Shuai.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.040
Listen, this week is very crucial for me.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:58.520
Let's not see each
other for now, all right?

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:06.720
Meng Tao.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.000
I'm sorry, Meng Tao. I...

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.200
Xiao Shuai, what's wrong?

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.736
You're looking for Jiang Xiao Shuai?

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.096
Jiang Xiao Shuai, right?

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:15.160
Yes.

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.400
Stop drinking.

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.280
No. We're out to have
fun, so we must drink.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:25.280
Yes. One more sip.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:29.480
- Drink mine.
- No.

00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:31.816
That's right.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.896
I can't drink anymore.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:34.520
A two-pronged attack.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.480
Are you drunk?

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.680
Tell me.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:00.080
How do you explain this?

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.480
I really don't remember anymore.

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:08.000
After we had a fight that day,

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.496
I was in a bad mood, so I
went drinking with my friends.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.920
A few more friends came. I
was already drunk at that time.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.680
Liar.

00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.080
Keep making it up.

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.040
Meng Tao, we've been together for so long.

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.320
Please believe me. I didn't betray you.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.440
Don't touch me.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.320
You're so dirty. Do you know that?

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.520
Jiang Xiao Shuai.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.400
Get out of my life.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.320
I really felt so dirty back then,

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.560
and that I wasn't good enough for him.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.857
That's him.

00:17:53.881 --> 00:17:55.096
Jiang Xiao Shuai joined
that disgusting thing.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.416
There are photos of it too.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.400
Him? He looks decent. His
personal life is such a mess.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.200
Most importantly, they're all men.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.040
- Darn it.
- Look at this photo.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.720
It was like I grew thorns.

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.216
Back then, I felt like
everyone passing me by

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.040
was pointing fingers at me.

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:11.736
- How exciting.
- Don't show it to me.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:14.960
Later on, he also married another woman.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.920
I clearly remember

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.160
putting my phone on silent mode.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.960
But for some reason,

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.280
the phone still rang.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.600
I didn't know how the
phone could ring for so long.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.640
It rang for so long as if I
had to pick up the phone.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.520
(Lin Lin's mom)

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.736
Hello, Dr. Jiang?

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:57.216
Dr. Jiang, Lin Lin fainted again.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.440
What should I do?

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.576
Your house is right next door.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.480
Can you please come and check now?

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.240
Thanks to your emergency
treatment last time,

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.736
when Lin Lin was sent to the hospital,

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.680
she was saved from the brink of death.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.160
If anything happens to Lin
Lin, what will happen to me?

00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.440
Dr. Jiang, please.

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.920
Back then, I just hated him.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.160
I hated him for spreading my photos.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.440
I hated him for making me want to die.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.560
But I didn't know

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.400
he was such a ruthless scumbag.

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.040
Xiao Shuai.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.200
Why didn't you tell me
something so important?

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:46.360
If you did, I would have confronted him.

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.721
A scumbag like him deserves
to die a thousand times over.

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.560
I'm sorry. We're closed for the day.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.160
It's okay, Xiao Shuai.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.536
The heavens is fair.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.600
He's getting what he deserves now.

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.880
Meng Tao!

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.680
How dare you come here?

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:13.440
Xiao Shuai.

00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.520
I'm sorry.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.560
I was wrong.

00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.600
Xiao Shuai.

00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:19.697
Xiao Shuai.

00:20:19.721 --> 00:20:20.776
I was wrong back then.

00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.480
- Let go of me.
- Xiao Shuai, I was wrong.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:25.040
- Let go of me!
- I was wrong.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.680
I deserve to die. I'm sorry, Xiao Shuai.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.680
I shouldn't have dumped you
just to marry my boss' daughter.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.376
I shouldn't have resorted
to such despicable means

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.040
just to dump you, all the more.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:35.800
I was wrong.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.720
I admit it.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.080
I was the one

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.600
who planned everything.

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.000
Those men.

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.200
I hired those men.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:49.536
Actually, you never slept with them.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:50.560
Xiao Shuai.

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.856
I knew it.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.880
You piece of trash!

00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.320
Xiao Shuai.

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.560
Xiao Shuai.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.176
Didn't you want to know the truth?

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.000
This is the whole truth.
I've told you everything.

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.440
I recorded the video too.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.457
I've also apologized.

00:21:09.481 --> 00:21:10.880
I swear. I promise.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.336
I won't do it again.

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.336
I swear I won't do it again.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.880
Xiao Shuai, can...

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.040
Xiao Shuai, can you ask
your friend to spare me?

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.856
Okay? Talk to him for me.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.120
Spare me. Okay?

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:23.720
Spare my worthless life.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:25.497
Xiao Shuai.

00:21:25.521 --> 00:21:26.960
I'm a jerk! I'm not human.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:29.520
I'm a jerk!

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:30.960
Xiao Shuai.

00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:32.960
Ask your friend to spare me.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:34.720
What are you talking about?

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.880
What friend? Don't touch me!

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:38.600
It's your friend with the surname Guo.

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.960
He said only if you forgive me,

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.280
then will he spare me.

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:45.040
My worthless life is not worth mentioning.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.400
Xiao Shuai, how about this?

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:49.296
For the sake

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.640
of our past relationship,

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:52.240
can you ask him to spare me?

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.456
Ask him to let me off. Xiao Shuai, please.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.040
- Darn it.
- Please spare me.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.600
Meng Tao.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.840
Are you even human?

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:02.080
You're just a piece of trash!

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.760
When you slandered me before,
didn't you think today will come?

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.496
When you hurt others before,

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.440
didn't you think this will happen today?

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.520
We all have to pay for what we did.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.376
You can apologize,

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.480
but I have a reason not to accept it.

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.840
Yes, you're right.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.400
Dr. Xiao Shuai, it's my fault.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.896
I'm not human. I'm trash.

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.976
I'm not human. I'm trash.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.040
- Spare me.
- Scram.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Get lost!

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:28.440
Darn it, he said get
lost. Didn't you hear it?

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:30.456
- Leave.
- Xiao Shuai, I'm sorry.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:32.760
Young Master Guo, I
already apologized. Spare me.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.960
Let me off. I already apologized.

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.576
You said you were going on a business trip.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.920
This was what you were busy with?

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.320
Thank you.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.680
It's nothing.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:04.720
What did you say?

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.800
"Thank you"?

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:08.960
You can say something nice?

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.280
Then say it again for me. Say it again.

00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.160
Do you want

00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:18.080
to kill me with that punch?

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:20.800
Luckily, I work out.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.440
Goodness.

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.600
When...

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.800
When did you find out?

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.360
Well,

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:32.200
I think

00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.680
since the day I followed you.

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.136
Can you stop pretending to be innocent?

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.680
It doesn't suit you.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.680
At first, I thought you
were quite interesting.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.520
I always wanted to come and tease you.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.360
"Jiang..."

00:23:58.560 --> 00:23:59.560
"Xiao..."

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:00.920
"Shuai."

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.160
I'll remember you.

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.040
- Okay.
- All right.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.200
- Ma'am, just take this.
- Dr. Xiao Shuai.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:12.280
Help me check why there's
no sound on this phone.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.616
Click here. Here.

00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:15.760
Thank you, Dr. Xiao Shuai.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:18.080
Later on,

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:20.760
I found out that you're
a warm and kind person.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.736
Li Wang.

00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:35.760
Look into someone for me.

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:36.800
His name is Meng Tao.

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.296
Jiang Xiao Shuai almost
committed suicide because of this.

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.960
Then he left his hometown and moved here.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.440
When I found out that
you were hurt so badly,

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.120
yet you can still embrace the world warmly,

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.480
I've decided

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.440
to help you get rid of your sensitive,

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.800
and inferior self.

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.000
It's not my fault.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.280
Apologize.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.800
Make him apologize to me.

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.320
Make him apologize to me.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.440
Go to sleep.

00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:15.760
Don't worry.

00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.360
I'll make sure

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.120
he pays back

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:23.720
what he owes you piece by piece.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.760
Do you admit it? Were you wrong or not?

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.456
I was wrong.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.520
That's enough.

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:31.360
Don't kill him yet.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:33.416
Drag him here.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.440
Get up!

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.720
Do you know why we're beating you up?

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.160
Speak up!

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.400
I know.

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.880
This has dragged on for so long.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.000
It's time to put closure to this.

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.600
Mr. Guo.

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.497
Mr. Guo.

00:25:53.521 --> 00:25:54.936
Mr. Guo, I know I was wrong.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.760
Please let me go. I'll be a
good person from now on.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.896
I won't do it again.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.456
I've gotten my karma.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.680
I'm begging you.

00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.360
Karma?

00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.000
After this video is recorded,

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.960
remember to find Jiang Xiao Shuai.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.800
Tell him everything you did back then.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.536
Yes.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.600
Record it!

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.400
You have no right to make demands.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.360
Do as I say.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.480
Otherwise,

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.080
I'll be the one to take your life.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:40.360
Go ahead.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.160
Raise your head.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.880
The exposé at school before

00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:46.720
is all true.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.360
I don't deserve to be a teacher.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:54.440
For years, I've been
dating many male students

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:56.680
using my identity as a teacher.

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.216
If this gets out, he's done for.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.000
Under the pretext of discussing projects,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.360
I lured them to the office.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:06.320
Make a wish.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.600
I wish

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:12.560
everything will go smoothly for us.

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.040
I'll make sure you get what you want.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.417
It's tiring to scold people, right?

00:27:27.441 --> 00:27:28.720
Let's go. I'll take you to eat.

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.456
For the Cantonese cuisine
you mentioned, let me tell you,

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:33.000
most Cantonese restaurants

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:34.760
focus on their dim sum.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.080
But for this place,

00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.280
their stir-fried dishes are the best.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.600
- Stir-fried dishes.
- You can taste the wok's flavor.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.080
Especially

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.000
their signature boneless carp.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.680
It's superb.

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.760
It melts in your mouth.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.160
It's so fresh

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.720
that you'd wish to swallow

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.840
your tongue too.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.680
Let's go, Xiao Shuai.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.160
I'll take you there.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.040
- Xiao Shuai.
- What's wrong?

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.480
Wait for me.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.160
Wang Shuo.

00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.720
Cheng Yu.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.760
You actually came back.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.240
You actually recognized me in one glance.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.760
You're good.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.720
All these years,

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.440
you've always put on airs.

00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:44.680
You walk as if you don't have legs.

00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:46.280
After having too many snakes,

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.600
I can naturally

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.680
tell you apart from normal people.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:53.920
Cheng Yu.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:55.880
Who is he?

00:28:57.840 --> 00:28:58.840
Hello.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.440
I'm Wang Shuo.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.560
Wang Shuo?

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.040
Jiang Xiao Shuai is good.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:26.960
He knows I want to talk to you,

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.080
so he left early.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.337
I like him.

00:29:29.361 --> 00:29:30.696
(There are snakes in the
garden, don't enter unless invited)

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.840
He's mine. I don't need you to like him.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.200
He's yours?

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.520
You're so protective of him.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.280
Back then,

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.200
I was half yours too, right?

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.160
I've never seen you so protective of me.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.600
I realized that after so many years,

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.600
your wickedness hasn't changed at all.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:54.496
In the blink of an eye,

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:55.760
I've been back for half a year.

00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.920
You've hidden for quite some time.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.520
What do you mean?

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.480
I have a home here too. Can't I come back?

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:06.040
Someone untied the horse you've tethered,

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.600
for six years.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.320
If you hadn't come back soon,

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.400
someone will take it away.

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.200
By then, it'll be too late
even if you want to chase it.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.200
If I chased after it a few months ago,

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.880
it would've been a matter
of just taking the rope.

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.880
If I chase after it now,

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:29.720
even if I take the rope,

00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:31.960
the horse might not necessarily follow me.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:34.640
Don't you

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.760
like adventurous games?

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.920
I'm leaving in a couple of days.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.480
Aren't you planning to see Chi Cheng?

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.240
It doesn't matter if I meet him or not.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.200
You won't leave.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.560
How do you know?

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.520
I just do.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.720
Guo Cheng Yu.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:07.720
You're too smart

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.960
to be likable.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.880
(Cheng Yu Snake Garden)

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.280
(Guo Cheng Yu: Sunny day)

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:10.200
It's nothing.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.880
(Guo Cheng Yu: Did you see the photo?)

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:37.616
(What's going on?)

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.960
I bumped into him on the street.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:40.400
He came to see you.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.496
(Didn't he come to see you?)

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.760
He said

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.520
he wants to meet up with you.

00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:57.640
(Jiang Xiao Shuai)

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.920
Why did he come back?

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.760
He's probably here to snatch him away.

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.920
You have to keep an eye on Chi Cheng.

00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.280
The lethality of the
return of one's first love

00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.400
is not something ordinary
people can handle.

00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.800
Do you want some water?

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.440
You

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.600
saw it?

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.720
See what?

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.600
If you want to go after him,

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:40.760
hurry up and do it.

00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.440
Otherwise, you'll lose your chance.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.880
No, tell me.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.280
Go after whom?

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.600
I remember someone

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.720
said this on someone's birthday.

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:54.960
"Don't let me see him again."

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.880
"If I see him again, I'll kill him."

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:05.200
Are you jealous?

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.160
How is that possible?

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.560
Yes.

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.800
Before, I thought killing him
would make me feel better.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.520
But then I met you.

00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.280
Why waste my time on that?

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:28.776
Don't try to sweet-talk me.

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:31.040
If you're so capable, get rid of him now.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.760
Wait. Do you like torturing
yourself that much?

00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:38.080
Must I explode from anger like
what you expected to satisfy you?

00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:44.080
Yes. I like seeing you explode from anger.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.280
I'm sorry to disappoint you then.

00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:48.840
Don't worry.

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.000
There's no crack in my heart anymore.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.680
Cheers!

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.720
Do you have a fish in your mouth? Drink it.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.360
This place hasn't changed at all.

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.160
But you've lost weight.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.320
What does it have to do with you?

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.480
Have you lost weight?

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.120
You didn't. You're quite
muscular, aren't you?

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:45.680
But you

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.000
are super darn skinny.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.360
With your figure now,

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.176
it's like being with a woman.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.400
Women won't like you.

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.760
If a man's with you,

00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.040
there's nothing much of you to play with.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.640
You have a freaking foul mouth.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.160
I'm skinny, but shapely.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.920
I just have low body fat.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.440
Didn't you enjoy being with me back then?

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.280
I almost forgot if you didn't tell me.

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:18.840
It was quite enjoyable indeed.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.120
However,

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.000
it was only that one time.

00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.240
Unlike Chi Cheng.

00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:26.280
He was with you,

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.600
for three years.

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.240
You have such a stinky mouth.

00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.680
Didn't your brother come back with you?

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:47.200
He did.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.400
He's busy with his own stuff.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:50.080
Speaking of your brother,

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.200
I remember when we were in college.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.136
Whenever you were bullied at school,

00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:56.720
your brother would rush over,

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.240
and beat you up.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.400
The bullies were so scared

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.920
that they begged your brother to stop.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
But that's good.

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.640
No one bullied you anymore.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.056
Do you know what this is called?

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.057
What is it called?

00:37:11.081 --> 00:37:12.361
It's called psychological abuse.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:14.320
Those who bullied me

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.400
saw that my own brother
even did that to me.

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.960
Who would dare to bully me?

00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:19.160
So they stayed away from me.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.040
Your brother is a genius.

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.240
I heard

00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:34.080
that the people you both
are pairing up with now

00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.320
are a teacher and apprentice.

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.360
Yes.

00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.160
Why do you two always do that?

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.200
You used to chase twins together.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.640
You couldn't even tell who is who.

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.296
Now, you're messing with
a teacher and apprentice.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.320
What?

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.640
Do you want to show off

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.040
how close you are?

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.160
We've always been

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:04.840
this close.

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:07.240
We are.

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.160
But stop smoking my freaking cigarettes.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.280
If you guys can't handle
your liquor, don't drink.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.920
I'll get going.

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:28.120
Go.

00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.160
I'll get going.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:33.920
Bye.
