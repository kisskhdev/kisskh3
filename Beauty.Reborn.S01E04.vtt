WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:12.451

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.840
I'm worried because…

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.920
I like you, Sarach.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.880
Mr. Din, It really is you.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.400
It's been, what, ten years?

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.960
Didn't think you'd remember me.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.200
If you knew from the start,
why didn't you say something?

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.760
You knew too and stayed quiet.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.000
Don't you want to know what the girl
Nam's crazy about looks like?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.280
So, you mean, you want me
to go after her or destroy her?

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.240
Figure out which one would please me more.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.640
Do you know how humiliating it was for me

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.080
to pawn my jewelry
just to cover your interest payment?

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.160
And look at you.
You can't get a single thing done.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.920
If you run PD into the ground,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.040
don't say I didn't warn you.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.120
You really like her that much, huh?

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.040
You know, why even ask?

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.800
Then let me tell you something.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.160
Sarah, or Sara,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.720
is that pimple-faced,
thick-browed, tick-chinned girl,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.760
the daughter of Uncle Suthee,
you used to look down on.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.680
Once the family decides
about the surgery, please let me know.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.760
Yes, Doctor.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.800
Sara.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.080
Yes, Dad?

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.880
Get me some water.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.200
Oh, sure.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.800
Mr. Nam?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.120
Hello, Uncle.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.560
You've really grown up, Mr. Nam.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.040
I came as soon as Din
told me what happened.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.040
Thank you, but you didn't
have to trouble yourself.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.960
I wanted to.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.840
Excuse me. I'm here
to take Mr. Suthee for a blood test.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.160
-Let's go, Dad.
-Oh, it's fine.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.680
Stay here and chat with Mr. Nam.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.680
I'll be right back.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.320
Okay.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.320
-Yes.
-This way, please.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:43.560
Well…

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.960
Ms. Sarah,

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.880
I wanted to apologize for everything
I did to you when we were kids.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.680
It's alright. That was a long time ago.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.040
But I really do feel bad.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.640
Can you forgive me?

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.400
I've already forgotten about it.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.880
It was just a bad childhood memory.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.200
But it wasn't all bad, you know.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.160
It made me stronger.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.040
Made me who I am today.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.480
The more you say that, the worse I feel.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.040
I'm over it.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.840
It doesn't affect me anymore,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.280
so please don't worry.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.840
Thank you.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.200
Hearing you say that
makes me feel a lot better.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.680
If it's possible,

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.520
could I have a chance
to make it up to you?

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.560
Din already has a head start on me.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.760
And now he's even further ahead
because of this.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.440
What do you mean?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.320
I mean, Din's always been nice to you.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.240
Hey! Nam, give that back!

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.960
Let's see. Who's this love letter for?

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.880
Give it back!

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.600
"Don't cry, okay?

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.200
Everyone's got strengths and flaws.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.480
Don't give up. Keep your spirits up.
I'm rooting for you."

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.440
Reading someone else's letter? That's bad!

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.480
Huh?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.760
Why do you even care about that ugly girl?

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.240
She's just staying at our house.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.640
You've done wrong and still aren't sorry?
Dad didn't raise us like that.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.840
We don't get to choose how we're born.
I'm sure she didn't want to be that way.

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.960
Think about it. If you were her,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.320
would you like being teased
and bullied like that?

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.920
Don't cry, okay?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.440
Everyone's got strengths and flaws.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.680
Don't give up. Keep your spirits up.
I'm rooting for you.

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.320
P.S. Eat the lollipop.
It'll make you smile.

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.360
Thanks.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.720
So, Mr. Din was the one
who wrote that letter.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.800
Another presentation tomorrow.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.520
These days never seem to end.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.000
Right.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.960
Here. This is to make up
for the other day.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.880
What are you plotting now?

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.520
I'm serious. I bought it to apologize.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.400
Keep it and eat it then.
Take it as me accepting your apology.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.280
If you don't take it,
that means you're still mad at me.

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.360
I told you I'm not mad. Now move.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.040
Oh!

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.000
You shouldn't have done that.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.760
Yeah, Rach. You went too far this time.

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.840
Yo even came over to apologize to you.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.080
If it were me, I'd be scared too,
with that act.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.440
-Cherry!
-Cherry!

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.600
Sorry I snapped at you.

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.400
I thought
you were gonna mess with me again.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.040
So, in your eyes, I'm just all bad,

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.520
nothing good about me, huh?

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.080
My dad's been sick lately.
I've just been stressed.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:25.520
Sorry about that.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:29.760
Uncle Suthee's unwell? Is it serious?

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.680
Yeah, pretty serious.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.880
I'm sorry for everything I've done before.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.160
I don't even know
why I treated you so badly.

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:51.160
But from now on,
I promise I won't do it again.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.280
Okay?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.720
Pinky swear? Isn't that a bit childish?

00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:01.120
If you won't, that means
you haven't forgiven me.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.760
Or do you want it official?

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.080
I'll print a peace treaty and sign it.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.200
That's a bit much.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.440
Your father's muscular heart disease

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.960
is caused by blocked coronary arteries.

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:44.240
It's been getting worse, and right now,
it's reached a critical stage.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.960
How much time do we have left, Doctor?

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:52.320
I can't say exactly,
but we need to act fast.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.360
As soon as there's a donor heart,
we operate immediately.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.520
Mr. Din?

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.000
You forgot to update me
on Uncle Suthee's condition.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.000
A heart transplant

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.400
is going to cost a lot.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:29.880
-I'll mortgage the house and land--
-It won't be fast enough. You know that.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.240
But I can help you.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:44.680
It's just that… I have one condition.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.520
You'll have to marry me.

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.160
-Uncle Perm.
-Yes, sir?

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.960
Is Ms. Sarah in today?

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.240
Oh, I thought you knew. She's on leave.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.120
I see.

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.000
There's no telling

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.120
when a donor heart will appear

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.920
or if it will be a match.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.040
And once it's removed,

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.120
it's only viable for four hours.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.280
Yes, Doctor.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:48.880
What we can do is keep
the patient ready at all times.

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.360
For now, all we can do is pray

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.920
that a heart arrives in time

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.680
and hope your father can hold on.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:21.320
Please take care of him, Doctor.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.240
We will.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.480
Once you finish this, send it right in.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.000
And be extra careful
with the heart documents.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:39.280
The factory says the gift set Ms. Sarah
designed and submitted is almost done.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.280
They'll let us know
when the prototype is ready.

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.160
Okay.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.200
Once they confirm,
have them come present it.

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.120
Got it.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.320
Come in.

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.360
Mr. Din, I'll get going now.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.120
I accept your offer.

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.760
But it's only a marriage in name.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.600
Don't you dare lay a finger on me.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.320
Agreed.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.600
I need to get the surgery money ready
as soon as possible.

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.680
Here you go, Mom.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.480
Chicken feet.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.440
-Eat up.
-Okay.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.120
So you'll have strength.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.920
Mom.

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.080
Sara and I…

00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.040
We're getting married.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.800
-Really, Din?
-Yes.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.600
-What did you do?
-Nam!

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.800
-Nam.
-What did you do?

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.840
How did you get her to say yes in one day?

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.240
-What dirty trick did you play? Say it.
-Nam…

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.680
She and I love each other.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.440
You couldn't win her.
Don't take it out on me.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.880
-Nam! Yo, stop your brother!
-Nam.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.280
-Nam, stop!
-Nam, stop!

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.080
She loves me. Never mind punching.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.640
Even if you kill me,

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.720
she still won't choose you.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.440
-Din…
-Nam!

00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.560
-Nam!
-Nam, stop. Stop! Yo.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.360
-Get him out of here. Go. Nam, stop.
-Let go!

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.560
Nam, stop.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:33.280
Go now!

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.600
-Out here. Come on.
-Let go.

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.960
-Nam.
-Nam, come here.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.920
-Calm down, son.
-Calm down, Nam.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.680
Let go! Didn't you see what he did?

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.320
He stole the woman I love!

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.240
I'm not letting him get away with it.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.640
-Nam!
-Nam!

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.760
Get a grip!

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.040
They've agreed to get married.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.640
What else can you do besides accept it?

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.480
No, Mom. A guy like Din
doesn't even know how to love.

00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.640
He only loves his work and himself!

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.560
Nam.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.680
-Listen to me. Listen.
-I…

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.200
will wait until
Ms. Sarah changes her mind.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.079
Nam.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.480
Wouldn't it be better to love someone
who actually loves you back?

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:25.160
That'd just be lying to myself, Mom.

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:26.960
Someone like me…

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:29.720
If I can't be with the one I love,

00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.720
then I won't be with anyone at all.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:38.680
-Nam.
-Nam.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.680
Are you happy you got a surgery slot?

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.400
Of course I'm happy.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.200
But I'm worried about something else.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.720
Tell me.
Who did you borrow the money from?

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.720
Right, you said mortgaging the house
and land would take too long.

00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.040
So, where did you get the money from?

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.880
I…

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.040
I borrowed it from Mr. Din, Dad.

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.880
He'll deduct it from my salary,
and I'll pay him back

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.200
It's not much for him anyway.
He won't mind.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.840
And since you were close with his father,

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:38.640
he's confident
we won't run off with the debt.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:45.760
Excuse me.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.240
Are you ready, Mr. Suthee?

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.520
Ready.

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:52.920
Good luck, Dad.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.680
We'll be waiting to hug you after, okay?

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:16.800
We'll be here.

00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:18.680
Hang in there, Dad.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:20.920
Alright.

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.400
Where's Uncle?

00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.600
He's already in surgery.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:51.480
Sorry I'm late.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.840
I called the office
and heard you took leave,

00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.720
so I figured you'd be here
and rushed over.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.880
Dad got an emergency surgery slot.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.440
Thanks so much for coming.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.760
Are you really going to marry Din?

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.240
I know you're not doing it willingly.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.960
Just tell me.

00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.960
What dirty trick did he use
to make you agree?

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.560
There's no trick.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.520
I'll tell you the truth.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.280
I've secretly fallen
for the person who wrote that letter

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.400
since I was a kid.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.320
And when I found out
that person was Mr. Din,

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:48.040
everything just made sense, because I know

00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.520
he loves me too.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.440
But I don't believe he does.
A guy like him can't love anyone.

00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:01.040
He only cares about himself
and the company.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.760
Thanks for the warning.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.160
If I get married and end up unhappy,

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.760
that's between me and him.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.760
But thank you again

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.760
for caring.

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:50.880
Sorry, we're closed.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.160
Nam.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:01.920
What's wrong?

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.040
What happened? Why are you crying?

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.600
I'm heartbroken.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.880
I've never hurt this much in my life.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.760
What happened?

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.040
Did Ms. Sarah turn you down?

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:41.160
Not just turn me down,

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.120
she's marrying Din.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.680
-Hello, Ms. Sarah.
-Hello.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.280
Hello, Ms. Sarah.

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:55.800
Hello.

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.840
-Mr. Perm.
-Yes?

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:11.120
Why's everyone acting so weird

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.920
and greeting me like this?

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.760
Oh, everyone knows
you and Mr. Din are getting married.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:22.480
I'm thrilled, really.

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.840
Hello.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:45.160
Don't start lecturing me about knocking.
I've got bigger news.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.560
Our wedding, you mean?

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.720
Huh?

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.240
Don't tell me you're the one
who told the whole company.

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.560
Uncle Perm knows, the world knows.
End of story.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.960
Why didn't you stop him?

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:06.840
Why would I?

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.280
Sooner or later,
everyone would find out anyway.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.440
Why are you so mad about it?

00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:17.160
Because it's not just that.
Do you know how far the rumors have gone?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.080
Hey, they say Mr. Din's only marrying

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.040
to fix the company's bad luck,
since it's struggling.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.040
Really?

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:27.680
I think so.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.880
At first, I thought
she'd end up with Mr. Apo,

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.280
he promoted her that hard.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.520
Won't the brothers
kill each other over this?

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:38.520
Exactly.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.080
I've been leading him on for years,

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.640
and somehow I lose to the new girl?

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.240
She totally came here to bag Mr. Din.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.720
That's what I think too.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.760
Rush a wedding like this,
what else could it be?

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.360
She's probably pregnant.

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:01.080
Gossiping
like my title means nothing, huh?

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:04.680
Yeah. But you're a guy. No harm done.

00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.040
Me, though…

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:10.480
Guess I should wear a ButterBear mascot
suit just to walk into the building.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:12.720
It's not that bad.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.680
But don't worry.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.600
I won't let your reputation take a hit.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.120
What so funny?

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:01.320
ENJOY YOUR WORK, ALRIGHT?

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.560
This is your plan to kill the rumors?

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:10.040
They're gossiping even more.

00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.760
Except now they're saying

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.840
I'm crazy about you,
chasing you till you agreed to marry me.

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.680
No harm done to you. And I'm a man.

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.400
I can take it.

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.560
I'll settle the bill.
You go see your dad first.

00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.840
Okay.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.680
You're still as kind as ever.

00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:41.440
Oh my…

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:45.680
Am I sick or something?
I can't stop smiling.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.200
You first.

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.400
Thank you.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.720
Once the gift set's ready,
can I let people outside test it?

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.720
It's not work hours yet.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.280
No need to wait. I'm impatient.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.800
Then today, we can go to…

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:37.760
Din.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:46.400
Eyes?

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.920
Choked on it, Mr. Perm?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.400
Thanks.

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.480
I didn't think Ms. Eyes
would come back to Mr. Din.

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.320
Come back?

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.520
No need to look so tense, Mr. Perm.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:27.720
One look at Mr. Din's face and I knew
she's an ex.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.040
But don't worry.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.720
I'm not petty. I just want to know

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:38.400
and understand the situation, that's all.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.440
Ms. Eyes dated Mr. Din back in college.

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:48.560
No idea why they broke up.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.280
Classic tight-lipped CEO.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.280
Thanks.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.400
Wow.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:15.080
I haven't been here in ages.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.040
But your office looks exactly the same.

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.680
The office is the same,
but everything else has changed.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.760
When you first came here,

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.560
PD was still one
of the top five cosmetics companies.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.360
But now…

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.000
I've heard the rumors too.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.800
But I believe in you.
You'll get through this,

00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:05.720
just like you always have.

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:13.720
Thanks.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.960
So, what brings you here, Eyes?

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:27.000
Are you crazy?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Why'd you bring
that woman back to see Din?

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.760
I didn't.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:37.520
I just saw on Facebook
she was back in Thailand, so I said hi.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.800
I just told her
to go check on him, that's all.

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:48.960
There's more.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.480
She's divorced.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:54.800
What?

00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.000
Whoa, hey. Come on.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:00.040
That'll stain, hard to wash out.

00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:03.520
You set her up for Din, didn't you?

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:08.000
If Din doesn't like her,
what can I do, right?

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.200
Have you forgotten

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.120
how bad it was
when he got his heart broken?

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.240
I remember, but that's his business.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.200
Eyes has always been nice to me.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:31.560
Are you mad because you're worried
or because you're jealous?

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:38.280
If you can tease me like that,
you must be pretty confident

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.040
she can make Din dump Ms. Sarah.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:14.840
Wow.

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.400
Din! You scared me.

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:31.480
Congrats to our new project lead.

00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.760
You knew?
They only announced it this evening.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.960
Then how would it be a surprise?

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.080
Din.

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.520
-Do you like it?
-I love it.

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.320
Thanks, Din. I love you.

00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:35.040
We promised we'd do our master's together.
Why did you do this?

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.280
Eyes…

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:42.600
My dad's sick,

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:45.000
and the company's in trouble.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:49.080
I really can't leave, Eyes.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.360
What about me? What about our life?

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:56.200
You're always like this.

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.280
Family. Company.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:01.080
Those are the only two things
that matter to you.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:05.560
That's not true. I care about you a lot.

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.440
Well, good thing you won't go with me.

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.320
Let's take a break.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.080
Eyes. Eyes.

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.040
Don't go.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.600
I love you.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.000
I think…

00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:00.080
we should renegotiate our deal.

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:02.720
Deal?

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.320
Call off the wedding.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.400
Let me pay for Dad's treatment
in installments.

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.640
That way, I won't have to force myself,

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.640
and you'll have a chance to get back
with Ms. Eyes.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.040
Win-win for both of us.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.480
No.

00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:23.240
Nothing's changing.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:28.960
Thanks for the ride.

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:58.160
Anyone could see from the moon
you still haven't gotten over her.

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:07.040
Why did you send Eyes to see me?

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.680
It's early, bro. I'm not arguing with you.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.040
I'm not arguing, just asking.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.560
Or is it that you can do it,
but can't admit it?

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:21.560
Honestly, whether Eyes
came or not doesn't matter.

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:24.040
What really matters

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.360
is how you feel.

00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:32.280
Lost my appetite. I'm out.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.880
Hello, Sara.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:46.440
Hi, Mr. Din.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.920
Are you ready
to go look at wedding dresses?

00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.920
Wedding dresses?
When did you schedule that?

00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.520
Alright then.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.720
I want to see you in a wedding dress too.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.160
Wait, I haven't said anything yet.

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.280
See you there.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.000
You mocking me?

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.920
You brought Eyes to see me,
hoping I'd get distracted,

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.760
or better yet, fight with Sara.

00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:25.280
So, I showed you it didn't work.

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:30.200
Sara and I will never fall apart
over your cheap tricks.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.040
I just came to warn you. Be careful.

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.880
The person who asked you to work
with them isn't exactly clean.

00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:12.600
But my offer still stands.
Call off the wedding.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.200
Are you a human or the Yellow River?

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.680
You really let your fiancé
go out with his ex?

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:21.320
Are you free today?

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.840
I really need to talk to you.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.520
Can you come to my condo?

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.480
Eyes! Eyes!

00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.760
Eyes!

00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.440
Eyes!

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:38.760
