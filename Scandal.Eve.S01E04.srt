1
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:14,452
I hear your sales are doing quite well.

2
00:00:14,536 --> 00:00:19,040
Thanks to your help, they have been
rising since the Kuryu Fujiwara scandal.

3
00:00:19,124 --> 00:00:22,126
Please, it's all thanks
to your skill as editor-in-chief.

4
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:25,797
Thank you for next year's
calendar deal as well.

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,340
The executives are thrilled.

6
00:00:27,423 --> 00:00:29,259
I expect you'll be promoted soon.

7
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:32,887
Perhaps you'll become
the next managing director?

8
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:34,806
Who can say?

9
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:37,225
Incidentally…

10
00:00:38,184 --> 00:00:42,188
I was hoping Buncho
would have an interview with our Aso.

11
00:00:43,147 --> 00:00:45,608
As part of marketing
for his international debut?

12
00:00:46,192 --> 00:00:47,777
Can I count on you?

13
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:49,153
Anytime.

14
00:00:51,364 --> 00:00:54,617
I'll be sure to return
the favor however I can.

15
00:00:56,786 --> 00:00:58,288
Let us both…

16
00:01:00,206 --> 00:01:02,125
make the best of this partnership.

17
00:01:03,918 --> 00:01:04,794
Agreed.

18
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:16,097
Thank you for the generous meal.

19
00:01:29,777 --> 00:01:30,904
Excuse me.

20
00:01:42,498 --> 00:01:43,583
Hello.

21
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,960
Any progress on that matter?

22
00:01:48,796 --> 00:01:50,673
I talked to her last night.

23
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:54,344
I'll get right to the point.

24
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,388
Our agency's understanding

25
00:01:57,472 --> 00:02:01,851
is that Hideto Aso did not commit
any kind of sexual assault.

26
00:02:02,644 --> 00:02:05,355
We're told that
it was entirely consensual.

27
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:09,234
If you were to try
and publicize this allegation,

28
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:13,196
we might be forced to pursue
a lawsuit against you for defamation.

29
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:18,660
But if you're willing to settle
this matter outside of court,

30
00:02:19,369 --> 00:02:24,499
we will compensate you for any
emotional distress you may have suffered

31
00:02:24,582 --> 00:02:26,459
as a result of this misunderstanding.

32
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:29,254
Can you agree to a settlement?

33
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:36,970
I need some time to think.

34
00:02:37,553 --> 00:02:39,264
I expect she'll agree.

35
00:02:39,847 --> 00:02:40,848
Expect?

36
00:02:40,932 --> 00:02:43,184
She said she needed time to think.

37
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:44,894
She'll respond at a later date.

38
00:02:46,104 --> 00:02:49,482
We'll start marketing efforts
for Aso's international debut soon.

39
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:52,652
You do understand
that scandals of this nature

40
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:55,321
are even more taboo overseas
than in Japan, yes?

41
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:56,406
Of course, ma'am.

42
00:02:56,489 --> 00:02:57,782
This is a critical period.

43
00:02:57,865 --> 00:03:00,284
We can't afford any mistakes.

44
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,744
I know.

45
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,705
Excuse me.

46
00:03:04,205 --> 00:03:07,208
Can you send room service to Room 3908?

47
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:08,418
Yes, sir.

48
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:11,671
Where are you?

49
00:03:14,007 --> 00:03:15,925
The Royal Prince Hotel.

50
00:03:37,447 --> 00:03:38,656
Is it true?

51
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:40,950
Mr. Aso committed sexual assault,

52
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:44,120
and Fujiwara's scandal was leaked
to cover that up?

53
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:46,122
We don't have any conclusive proof.

54
00:03:46,205 --> 00:03:49,083
But everything would make sense
if that was true.

55
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:52,378
It's not unheard of for big agencies
to make deals with publishers

56
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:57,759
to suppress a scandal by providing them
with another scandal in exchange.

57
00:03:58,634 --> 00:04:03,014
The person behind the cover-up
was most likely their CEO, Yoko Kodama.

58
00:04:03,097 --> 00:04:04,724
The boss herself?

59
00:04:05,266 --> 00:04:07,477
Aso is the face of their agency.

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,938
She'd stop at nothing
to keep him out of trouble.

61
00:04:12,315 --> 00:04:13,399
Unbelievable.

62
00:04:14,692 --> 00:04:15,902
That's just horrible.

63
00:04:16,694 --> 00:04:17,653
Mori.

64
00:04:17,737 --> 00:04:22,784
If what you're saying is true,
Aso's agency covered up his sexual assault

65
00:04:22,867 --> 00:04:26,079
by selling out Mr. Fujiwara
and destroying his career.

66
00:04:26,162 --> 00:04:28,539
Everything they've done is awful.

67
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:30,416
They can't just get away with it!

68
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:32,460
They won't.

69
00:04:33,336 --> 00:04:34,379
Of course not.

70
00:04:35,004 --> 00:04:36,255
Then…

71
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:37,465
Ma'am.

72
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:42,512
Are you going to expose
Aso's sexual assault allegations?

73
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:46,974
That's too reckless!

74
00:04:47,058 --> 00:04:50,311
We're already being persecuted
by Kodama Productions!

75
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:51,813
If we defy them any further,

76
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:55,233
they will take more severe measures,
and we won't be able to survive!

77
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:58,403
Hirata from Weekly Buncho
said she'd cooperate.

78
00:04:58,486 --> 00:05:01,823
You mean the reporter
who wrote the article on Fujiwara?

79
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:02,949
We can't trust her!

80
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:06,744
If we don't do anything about it,
our agency is done for.

81
00:05:09,414 --> 00:05:13,042
And beyond that,
this doesn't concern only us.

82
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:18,005
This case is just the tip of the iceberg.

83
00:05:19,715 --> 00:05:22,635
Complaints raised by those
who've been unjustly hurt

84
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:25,388
are being erased
by favoritism and manipulation.

85
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,433
We can't just sit back and let it happen!

86
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,315
I refuse to avert my eyes.

87
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,787
Morning.

88
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:51,664
-Good morning.
-Morning.

89
00:05:51,747 --> 00:05:53,332
Good morning.

90
00:06:05,428 --> 00:06:07,555
Ninomiya, can I talk to you?

91
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:08,514
Yeah.

92
00:06:27,491 --> 00:06:29,202
So? What is it?

93
00:06:33,497 --> 00:06:34,498
What is this?

94
00:06:34,582 --> 00:06:37,752
INVOICE AMOUNT: 3,000,000 YEN

95
00:06:37,835 --> 00:06:39,587
Where did you…

96
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,255
I found it in your room.

97
00:06:49,138 --> 00:06:51,557
Three million yen
from the editing department.

98
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:54,852
Says it's payment for a draft,
but the amount is too high.

99
00:06:58,606 --> 00:07:00,316
Were you bribed by the editor-in-chief?

100
00:07:02,276 --> 00:07:04,820
-I don't know what you mean.
-Don't play dumb!

101
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:10,034
You tried to write an article
on Aso's sexual assault.

102
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:13,996
But the editor-in-chief is connected
to Yoko Kodama and stopped you.

103
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,207
Three million yen for your silence.

104
00:07:16,874 --> 00:07:18,459
And to the editor-in-chief,

105
00:07:18,543 --> 00:07:22,463
Yoko Kodama offered a scandal on Fujiwara
she had bought off someone in the past,

106
00:07:22,547 --> 00:07:24,215
which I wrote an article on.

107
00:07:25,758 --> 00:07:27,885
You knew it all, but you kept quiet.

108
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:28,928
Am I wrong?

109
00:07:34,308 --> 00:07:35,810
You won't deny it?

110
00:07:39,564 --> 00:07:42,400
I'll follow up
on Hideto Aso's sexual assault allegation.

111
00:07:42,483 --> 00:07:44,610
Give me the informant's contact info.

112
00:07:45,486 --> 00:07:46,696
I can't.

113
00:07:48,072 --> 00:07:51,701
Did you agree not to tell anyone,
so you could get the money?

114
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:57,164
How hard do you think it was

115
00:07:57,248 --> 00:08:00,209
for the victim to speak up
about what happened?

116
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:03,379
"Surely Buncho would let the world know."

117
00:08:03,462 --> 00:08:06,257
Have you considered
how she felt, being betrayed like that?

118
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,350
You could've taken it to another publisher
if ours wouldn't work.

119
00:08:16,434 --> 00:08:17,268
So why?

120
00:08:17,351 --> 00:08:19,478
I didn't want to back off either.

121
00:08:19,562 --> 00:08:22,231
-Then why--
-I don't have a company protecting me.

122
00:08:22,315 --> 00:08:24,108
If Kodama Productions wanted,

123
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:26,235
a freelancer like me
would have nowhere to go!

124
00:08:29,113 --> 00:08:30,906
You should stop too.

125
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,950
You'll get kicked out of the company.

126
00:08:36,329 --> 00:08:37,538
Is that all?

127
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:39,707
Fine.

128
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:48,215
I think it's almost certain

129
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:51,385
that Kodama Productions forced
Buncho to suppress the article.

130
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:53,220
Are you sure?

131
00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:56,891
I'll try to find a way to contact
the informant who came to Buncho,

132
00:08:56,974 --> 00:09:00,603
but there's a risk, our editor-in-chief
could fill Yoko Kodama in on my moves,

133
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:02,980
so I can't be too conspicuous.

134
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:04,065
I understand.

135
00:09:04,148 --> 00:09:06,651
We'll try to take action on our end too,

136
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:08,736
but I'm curious how Kodama Pro will act.

137
00:09:08,819 --> 00:09:12,281
Agreed. I'm certain that they will try
to track down the informant

138
00:09:12,365 --> 00:09:14,950
and try to settle or buy her silence.

139
00:09:15,034 --> 00:09:17,870
We have to make sure we don't fall behind.

140
00:09:24,043 --> 00:09:26,253
Mr. Aso, Mr. Ichinose, it's time.

141
00:09:28,506 --> 00:09:29,674
This way.

142
00:09:29,757 --> 00:09:31,300
Good to go.

143
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:34,804
-Ready here.
-Thank you.

144
00:09:45,648 --> 00:09:48,693
SAKI IOKA
ONE MISSED CALL

145
00:09:52,905 --> 00:09:55,157
-Good to go.
-Thank you.

146
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:21,976
Ioka.

147
00:10:24,937 --> 00:10:27,690
-Sorry I'm late.
-No, I'm sorry for calling so suddenly.

148
00:10:27,773 --> 00:10:28,858
This way.

149
00:10:35,781 --> 00:10:37,658
So what did you want to talk about?

150
00:10:39,285 --> 00:10:41,370
I heard through the grapevine

151
00:10:42,246 --> 00:10:45,666
that a scandal on Mr. Aso
might be coming out.

152
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:47,793
What kind?

153
00:10:47,877 --> 00:10:49,378
I don't know that much.

154
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:52,256
But I hear it was leaked recently
by someone involved in it,

155
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:55,593
and Buncho is trying
to verify it right now.

156
00:10:55,676 --> 00:10:58,012
That got me a little concerned.

157
00:11:01,265 --> 00:11:02,183
You okay?

158
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:07,188
Yeah. It's probably just some rumor.

159
00:11:07,855 --> 00:11:11,233
I would've heard before you
if it was something like that.

160
00:11:12,401 --> 00:11:14,653
-That's true.
-Yeah.

161
00:11:15,237 --> 00:11:16,238
Here you go.

162
00:11:17,781 --> 00:11:18,741
Thanks.

163
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,659
And you, ma'am?

164
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:23,204
I'm good, thanks.

165
00:11:35,758 --> 00:11:38,052
The number you have dialed can't respond--

166
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,235
HIDETO ASO

167
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,492
Good afternoon.

168
00:12:03,244 --> 00:12:04,453
Man, I'm tired.

169
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:07,373
-Mizuguchi.
-Yes?

170
00:12:07,456 --> 00:12:10,960
What was she like? That woman
who met Mr. Ninomiya a while back?

171
00:12:11,043 --> 00:12:13,420
-What?
-Did you see her? Know her name?

172
00:12:13,504 --> 00:12:15,548
I only saw her for an instant.

173
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:17,216
Right.

174
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:20,761
Wait, let me guess.

175
00:12:20,844 --> 00:12:22,555
Are you into Mr. Ninomiya?

176
00:12:23,347 --> 00:12:24,181
What?

177
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:27,351
Now I get it. So it's like that.

178
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:29,311
-No, it's not.
-Yamamoto!

179
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:30,312
Sir?

180
00:12:34,608 --> 00:12:36,235
By the way, did you hear?

181
00:12:36,318 --> 00:12:37,945
The editor-in-chief
is going to be promoted

182
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:39,655
to managing director.

183
00:12:39,738 --> 00:12:42,908
-What?
-Becoming a managing director at that age?

184
00:12:42,992 --> 00:12:44,952
How do you think he managed that?

185
00:12:48,372 --> 00:12:49,623
Hirata!

186
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:50,583
Coming.

187
00:12:58,007 --> 00:13:01,635
This is still off-the-record,
but Kodama Productions' Hideto Aso

188
00:13:02,136 --> 00:13:05,180
will be starring
in a joint US-Japan drama next year.

189
00:13:06,098 --> 00:13:07,266
I see.

190
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:11,854
We're going to run an interview with Aso
at the same time as its announcement.

191
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:13,147
You go do it.

192
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:15,232
What? Me?

193
00:13:16,275 --> 00:13:18,444
They asked for you.

194
00:13:20,654 --> 00:13:23,157
Time is 1:00 p.m. tomorrow. Got it?

195
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:25,951
Yes.

196
00:13:37,004 --> 00:13:38,172
Pardon me.

197
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:46,889
I told you last time not to visit me here.

198
00:13:48,223 --> 00:13:52,186
Did you tell anyone
about what we discussed last time?

199
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,855
-I did not.
- Are you sure?

200
00:13:54,938 --> 00:13:57,941
Of course. Why would I?

201
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,489
I await a good response
to the settlement offer.

202
00:14:05,449 --> 00:14:09,411
We'd prefer to avoid
taking any forceful measures.

203
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,877
-Can I get the bill?
-Yes, sir.

204
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:28,973
Sorry to startle you.

205
00:14:33,936 --> 00:14:37,022
I can't get into details here,

206
00:14:37,731 --> 00:14:41,110
but I have something important
to discuss with you.

207
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:46,991
PROOF OF RECOLLECTION

208
00:14:58,293 --> 00:15:01,922
KAGAWA
IT WENT WELL

209
00:15:29,658 --> 00:15:31,285
Ms. Hirata.

210
00:15:31,368 --> 00:15:33,162
Sorry to keep you waiting.

211
00:15:33,245 --> 00:15:35,664
It's nice to see you again.

212
00:15:41,003 --> 00:15:42,337
Why me?

213
00:15:42,421 --> 00:15:45,382
Because you're a talented reporter.

214
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,887
That's why I'd love for you
to write an article for us.

215
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:53,599
I didn't realize
you had such a high opinion of my skills.

216
00:15:53,682 --> 00:15:56,060
Take a seat. And please wait.

217
00:16:08,197 --> 00:16:10,866
Nice to meet you.
I'm Saki Ioka, this agency's CEO.

218
00:16:12,201 --> 00:16:14,286
This is Mr. Tozaki, our lawyer.

219
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:15,412
Nice to meet you.

220
00:16:16,371 --> 00:16:17,581
A lawyer?

221
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,667
Ms. Riko,

222
00:16:21,418 --> 00:16:27,382
I understand that you were once a talent
under the stage name Risa Hirayama,

223
00:16:27,466 --> 00:16:29,927
affiliated with the agency MK Promotion.

224
00:16:31,011 --> 00:16:32,721
That's correct.

225
00:16:33,472 --> 00:16:37,935
If it's not too personal,
may I ask why you left?

226
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:40,479
That's…

227
00:16:40,562 --> 00:16:43,398
Were you forced to leave
against your will?

228
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:54,243
We called you here today to ask you
about an incident you were a victim of.

229
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,286
Do you mean…

230
00:16:57,121 --> 00:16:58,664
The incident with Hideto Aso.

231
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:06,213
When will you start filming in America?

232
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:09,216
What?

233
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:13,387
When will you start filming in America?

234
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,432
The filming itself starts in six months,

235
00:17:17,516 --> 00:17:21,478
but there's other prep to be done,
so I'd like to go as soon as possible.

236
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:25,357
I understand that in this drama,

237
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,070
you'll be playing an anti-hero
who's both charming yet has a cruel side.

238
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:32,156
It should be new ground for you,

239
00:17:32,239 --> 00:17:34,616
having mostly played
upright characters so far.

240
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,701
Indeed.

241
00:17:35,784 --> 00:17:39,705
It seems the show will also have scenes
with extreme sexual content and violence.

242
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:41,832
Such scenes are included,

243
00:17:41,915 --> 00:17:45,544
but I'm sure it will be
a challenging venture for me.

244
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,425
Do you see any part of yourself
in the character you'll be portraying?

245
00:17:52,176 --> 00:17:57,472
For example, is there a different side
of you that you can't show to others?

246
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,607
Doesn't everyone have some hidden secret?

247
00:18:18,035 --> 00:18:22,080
You took your story to a magazine
but it went nowhere, as I understand.

248
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:26,668
We suspect that Buncho's higher-ups

249
00:18:26,752 --> 00:18:30,672
refrained from publishing it
on orders of Kodama Productions.

250
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:33,634
Shameful conduct for a press company.

251
00:18:34,426 --> 00:18:36,970
It took great courage
for you to disclose it.

252
00:18:37,763 --> 00:18:38,931
It must be frustrating.

253
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:45,979
Will you try one more time
to get an article published?

254
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,903
It's unacceptable for a victim
to be forced to stay quiet.

255
00:18:53,528 --> 00:18:55,739
We'll help you in whatever way we can.

256
00:19:00,494 --> 00:19:01,662
If you're willing--

257
00:19:01,745 --> 00:19:03,789
I'm already done with it.

258
00:19:04,414 --> 00:19:05,582
I'm going to settle.

259
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:10,545
Kodama Productions
reached out to me a while back.

260
00:19:11,255 --> 00:19:13,257
And I figured it's been long enough.

261
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,466
So you're giving up?

262
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:20,806
Don't make it sound so simple.

263
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:25,185
I've already tried everything I could!

264
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:28,563
I talked to my manager,
my agency, and even Buncho.

265
00:19:28,647 --> 00:19:30,107
Several times.

266
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:33,193
But nothing ever came of it.

267
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:37,239
I'm sure the police
won't take me seriously either.

268
00:19:38,323 --> 00:19:42,286
I might as well take
the money and put this all behind me.

269
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:43,745
Is that wrong?

270
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,334
And people from Kodama Pro
have been coming to my place of work.

271
00:19:49,418 --> 00:19:50,794
It's a huge bother.

272
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,588
So you'll agree to a settlement?

273
00:19:54,339 --> 00:19:58,051
If you settle, you'll have to sign
a non-disclosure agreement,

274
00:19:58,135 --> 00:20:01,179
which will forbid you
from ever going public with it.

275
00:20:01,263 --> 00:20:04,683
Are you really okay with settling
despite those conditions?

276
00:20:09,313 --> 00:20:11,023
Of course not.

277
00:20:12,524 --> 00:20:14,735
Can you people even imagine it?

278
00:20:14,818 --> 00:20:19,531
I have to see his face on TV
or the Internet, whether I want to or not!

279
00:20:20,824 --> 00:20:21,992
After he…

280
00:20:23,201 --> 00:20:24,911
did that to me…

281
00:20:26,288 --> 00:20:29,833
he gets to smile and bask
in the limelight like it never happened!

282
00:20:31,543 --> 00:20:34,713
How could I ever be okay with that?

283
00:20:36,006 --> 00:20:37,215
But I…

284
00:20:44,473 --> 00:20:49,311
The perpetrator gets protected
while the victim gets silenced.

285
00:20:49,394 --> 00:20:51,396
That's not how it should be.

286
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:57,652
Aso doesn't deserve to get away
with putting you through all this.

287
00:21:01,198 --> 00:21:02,616
Will you please…

288
00:21:03,617 --> 00:21:06,036
try one more time to go public with this?

289
00:21:07,621 --> 00:21:09,623
I know a reporter who can help.

290
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:12,709
Thank you for today.

291
00:21:13,502 --> 00:21:15,796
Likewise. It was a pleasure.

292
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:24,054
Are you free?

293
00:21:24,137 --> 00:21:24,971
Sorry?

294
00:21:25,931 --> 00:21:29,643
We could get a drink at a bar nearby.

295
00:21:31,103 --> 00:21:34,022
I appreciate the offer,
but I still have work to do.

296
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:35,649
Maybe some other time.

297
00:21:36,233 --> 00:21:37,984
Ms. Hirata.

298
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:41,947
I hope you'll continue
to have a good relationship

299
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,491
with Aso and our agency.

300
00:21:45,492 --> 00:21:46,660
So do I.

301
00:22:12,269 --> 00:22:14,062
Ma'am, she's here.

302
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:16,565
Sorry to call you so suddenly.

303
00:22:16,648 --> 00:22:18,984
-The informant is in here.
-Okay.

304
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:21,903
Do you plan to publish it
in Weekly Buncho?

305
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:25,323
No, it wouldn't get past
the editor-in-chief at Buncho,

306
00:22:25,407 --> 00:22:27,617
so I'm acting on my own for now.

307
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:31,496
I'll think about the next steps
after listening to the victim's account.

308
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,789
Understood.

309
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:33,915
This way.

310
00:22:38,128 --> 00:22:39,296
Sorry for the wait.

311
00:22:40,255 --> 00:22:44,176
Let me introduce you.
This is Ms. Hirata, a reporter.

312
00:22:48,805 --> 00:22:49,764
Why?

313
00:22:52,142 --> 00:22:53,560
It's her?

314
00:22:54,603 --> 00:22:55,437
Yes.

315
00:22:57,689 --> 00:22:58,648
Riko.

316
00:23:02,068 --> 00:23:03,737
What-- Ms. Riko?

317
00:23:04,905 --> 00:23:07,532
I have nothing to say to her.

318
00:23:07,616 --> 00:23:10,535
Wait. Excuse me. Ms. Riko!

319
00:23:11,786 --> 00:23:13,872
Do you know her?

320
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:21,546
She's my younger sister.

321
00:23:24,674 --> 00:23:26,718
Ms. Riko! Ms. Riko.

322
00:23:26,801 --> 00:23:28,428
What happened? Please talk to me.

323
00:23:28,511 --> 00:23:31,389
-I have nothing to say.
-Please!

324
00:23:31,473 --> 00:23:32,974
Leave me alone.

325
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,615
Thank you.

326
00:23:55,247 --> 00:24:00,210
Riko was scouted by a talent agency
when she was in high school.

327
00:24:02,087 --> 00:24:04,256
She went against our parents' wishes,

328
00:24:04,339 --> 00:24:07,342
and moved to Tokyo
after dropping out of school.

329
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,098
But this industry
is a hard place to survive in.

330
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:16,935
We never heard her name
in any big announcements.

331
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:24,359
As our parents grew more worried,
she contacted us less and less.

332
00:24:27,028 --> 00:24:31,866
She didn't even show up
to our father's funeral.

333
00:24:34,411 --> 00:24:36,621
I can't forgive her selfishness

334
00:24:37,414 --> 00:24:41,543
nor the entertainment industry
that lured her in with sweet promises,

335
00:24:41,626 --> 00:24:43,211
then discarded her.

336
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,631
I'm sorry.

337
00:24:47,132 --> 00:24:48,633
I couldn't stop her.

338
00:24:49,634 --> 00:24:51,303
I should go too.

339
00:24:52,262 --> 00:24:55,015
-Wait, but--
-It's okay, Kagawa

340
00:24:55,098 --> 00:24:56,057
But…

341
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,852
Even if they were estranged,

342
00:24:58,935 --> 00:25:02,689
she only just found out
that her own sister was part of all this.

343
00:25:05,942 --> 00:25:09,904
RISA HIRAYAMA

344
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,044
AFTER THE MASTER OF THE MANSION DIED

345
00:25:28,965 --> 00:25:29,883
Hirata.

346
00:25:32,594 --> 00:25:35,180
Finish up Aso's interview
and send it to me.

347
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:36,723
Yes, sir.

348
00:25:36,806 --> 00:25:40,810
The CEO of Kodama is nagging me,
saying she wants to see the draft.

349
00:25:40,894 --> 00:25:41,895
Thanks.

350
00:26:00,288 --> 00:26:02,791
-Goodbye.
-See you tomorrow.

351
00:26:06,836 --> 00:26:09,381
No word from Ms. Riko?

352
00:26:09,464 --> 00:26:10,382
None.

353
00:26:10,965 --> 00:26:14,552
Here she finally worked up the courage
to talk about it,

354
00:26:14,636 --> 00:26:17,263
but we damaged her trust in us.

355
00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:19,432
It wasn't your fault.

356
00:26:19,516 --> 00:26:22,644
Who could've guessed
that the reporter was her sister?

357
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:27,315
How about convincing her
to talk to a different reporter?

358
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:31,986
But I don't know if we should
push her anymore right now.

359
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,656
How will we counter
Kodama Productions then?

360
00:26:35,448 --> 00:26:38,743
Unless we weaken their influence
by exposing Aso's sexual assault,

361
00:26:38,827 --> 00:26:40,453
they'll keep pressuring us.

362
00:26:41,413 --> 00:26:43,832
Call me if there are any updates. Goodbye.

363
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:54,384
I found something.

364
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:56,010
What?

365
00:26:56,678 --> 00:26:58,596
Take a look at this.

366
00:27:00,515 --> 00:27:02,016
DOCUMENTARY KODAMA PRODUCTIONS

367
00:27:03,184 --> 00:27:04,477
What's this?

368
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:06,146
A Kodama Productions audition.

369
00:27:07,897 --> 00:27:09,774
From when Yuri Hara joined.

370
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:12,902
Yuri Hara?

371
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:17,157
A talent I was in charge of
back at Kodama Pro.

372
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,576
Wait, but isn't she the one--

373
00:27:22,912 --> 00:27:27,083
I thought I'd seen Ms. Riko before,
so I did some research.

374
00:27:34,424 --> 00:27:35,800
Back there.

375
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:54,319
Good day.

376
00:28:03,661 --> 00:28:04,996
Mom? What is it?

377
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,539
Kanade?

378
00:28:07,123 --> 00:28:10,376
I wanted to talk to you
about Dad's memorial service.

379
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,754
When will you come home next?

380
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:15,924
Sorry, I can't say yet.
I'll let you know when I'm sure.

381
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:17,509
Oh, and also,

382
00:28:18,301 --> 00:28:20,011
have you heard from Riko?

383
00:28:24,224 --> 00:28:27,602
I tried calling her,
but it never goes through.

384
00:28:28,394 --> 00:28:30,021
Just forget her already.

385
00:28:30,104 --> 00:28:32,482
But I'm still worried about her.

386
00:28:33,525 --> 00:28:35,777
I wonder where she is
and what she's doing.

387
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:39,739
Sorry, Mom.
I'm still at work. Call you later.

388
00:28:52,377 --> 00:28:53,294
Hello?

389
00:29:00,802 --> 00:29:01,928
Doesn't Hirata…

390
00:29:02,846 --> 00:29:04,889
seem strange to you lately?

391
00:29:05,598 --> 00:29:06,432
What?

392
00:29:07,016 --> 00:29:08,059
Doesn't she?

393
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:10,687
Why would you ask me?

394
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:12,730
Aren't you two dating?

395
00:29:12,814 --> 00:29:15,108
-What?
-Don't bother playing dumb.

396
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:18,236
I used to be a reporter too. I can tell.

397
00:29:21,364 --> 00:29:24,659
Did you tell her
about that thing with Aso?

398
00:29:26,494 --> 00:29:28,663
No, of course not.

399
00:29:37,005 --> 00:29:40,884
This is the Aso interview article
that she wrote up.

400
00:29:43,887 --> 00:29:46,472
She didn't go for anything too deep.

401
00:29:47,891 --> 00:29:49,893
Looks to me like she's cautious.

402
00:29:52,103 --> 00:29:53,313
Be honest.

403
00:29:54,689 --> 00:29:56,816
How much has she found out?

404
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:01,613
I don't know.

405
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:03,364
I really don't.

406
00:30:17,795 --> 00:30:20,131
-Sorry for calling you so late.
-It's fine.

407
00:30:21,132 --> 00:30:23,301
About what happened this afternoon…

408
00:30:23,384 --> 00:30:24,928
Can I go first?

409
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:29,807
I'm considering backing out
of the Hideto Aso situation.

410
00:30:30,892 --> 00:30:33,895
I know I'm the one
who brought it up to you, so I apologize.

411
00:30:35,688 --> 00:30:37,982
Is it because your sister is involved?

412
00:30:39,067 --> 00:30:40,443
As a reporter,

413
00:30:40,526 --> 00:30:44,405
I judged that it would be difficult
to keep my personal feelings out of it.

414
00:30:46,699 --> 00:30:50,703
And besides,
I doubt that she would open up to me.

415
00:30:51,829 --> 00:30:53,915
We never exactly got along.

416
00:30:54,916 --> 00:30:56,751
Neither of us wants to see each other.

417
00:30:57,835 --> 00:30:58,962
Do you really…

418
00:31:00,004 --> 00:31:00,922
feel that way?

419
00:31:05,635 --> 00:31:07,929
I have something I want you to see.

420
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:26,614
What's this?

421
00:31:27,365 --> 00:31:30,076
A video of an old audition
for Kodama Productions.

422
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,915
Keep going!

423
00:31:36,582 --> 00:31:37,709
The one in the back.

424
00:31:40,044 --> 00:31:41,004
That's Ms. Riko.

425
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:43,131
And two, and three, and four…

426
00:31:43,214 --> 00:31:45,591
I asked the other participants too.

427
00:31:46,467 --> 00:31:50,596
While she didn't pass the audition,
she worked harder than anyone.

428
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,515
Two, three, four.

429
00:31:52,598 --> 00:31:54,934
Five, six, seven, eight.

430
00:31:55,018 --> 00:31:58,396
One, two, three, four.

431
00:32:00,523 --> 00:32:02,275
This industry is special.

432
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:07,405
Once you enter it, it's not easy
to return to a regular life.

433
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,076
Some people get a lucky break,

434
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,538
while others find no success
despite putting in great effort.

435
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:24,380
Because you yourself are the product.

436
00:32:25,173 --> 00:32:30,553
If things don't go well, you feel like
your own worth is being rejected.

437
00:32:32,388 --> 00:32:35,808
You wish for validation, grow desperate,

438
00:32:36,684 --> 00:32:38,352
and find yourself trapped.

439
00:32:41,105 --> 00:32:43,441
That's how this industry enchants people.

440
00:32:46,694 --> 00:32:49,947
I don't think Ms. Riko
neglected her family.

441
00:32:50,573 --> 00:32:53,159
I think she kept
struggling the entire time.

442
00:32:54,577 --> 00:32:59,248
So that one day, her family would accept
the path she chose.

443
00:33:04,337 --> 00:33:06,172
What would you understand?

444
00:33:07,548 --> 00:33:08,716
What about you?

445
00:33:09,634 --> 00:33:12,053
Can you really say
you understand Ms. Riko?

446
00:33:15,056 --> 00:33:18,059
It's true that this industry
has a foul side to it,

447
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,979
but most talents
put in everything they've got,

448
00:33:22,063 --> 00:33:24,690
and the management tries to support them.

449
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:27,401
And yet, some never get accepted.

450
00:33:28,361 --> 00:33:32,782
I'd say I understand
how lonely that can make them feel.

451
00:33:36,035 --> 00:33:37,829
What is it that drives you?

452
00:33:37,912 --> 00:33:38,871
Right.

453
00:33:39,705 --> 00:33:43,501
I left my home against my parents' wish.

454
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,295
I know they must be worried,

455
00:33:46,379 --> 00:33:49,382
so I want to put them at ease
by showing some results.

456
00:33:50,633 --> 00:33:51,592
Thank you.

457
00:33:51,676 --> 00:33:52,635
Thank you too.

458
00:33:52,718 --> 00:33:54,428
-That'll be all.
-Thank you.

459
00:34:05,439 --> 00:34:07,608
YOU HAVE AN UNREAD MESSAGE

460
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:12,572
RIKO, RIGHT?
THIS IS KANADE. CAN WE TALK?

461
00:34:19,745 --> 00:34:20,788
Hey there.

462
00:34:20,872 --> 00:34:22,790
-You alone?
-Let's drink together.

463
00:34:22,874 --> 00:34:24,709
-Our treat.
-Just one, okay?

464
00:34:24,792 --> 00:34:26,335
Hey. Wait up!

465
00:34:26,836 --> 00:34:29,589
RIKO, RIGHT?
THIS IS KANADE. CAN WE TALK?

466
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:48,774
Welcome.

467
00:34:48,858 --> 00:34:50,735
-Two coffees.
-Coming right up.

468
00:34:58,326 --> 00:34:59,452
Here it is.

469
00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:02,914
The proposal
for the online drama that Mori got us.

470
00:35:02,997 --> 00:35:05,750
It's not a major production,
but shall we take it?

471
00:35:08,419 --> 00:35:09,921
Let's give it a try.

472
00:35:10,504 --> 00:35:12,423
I hope it works out.

473
00:35:12,506 --> 00:35:16,010
We have to keep ourselves afloat,
even if it's through small jobs.

474
00:35:21,057 --> 00:35:21,974
Ma'am?

475
00:35:24,727 --> 00:35:31,400
In this industry, only few people succeed
even after passing strict auditions.

476
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,781
Most of them
just exhaust themselves and fade away.

477
00:35:38,032 --> 00:35:39,367
That's…

478
00:35:41,327 --> 00:35:44,121
You know what Yuri's parents
said to me at her funeral?

479
00:35:45,456 --> 00:35:47,541
"You people are monsters."

480
00:35:49,585 --> 00:35:52,380
Ms. Yuri's death wasn't your fault.

481
00:35:54,465 --> 00:35:56,842
I should've been with her more.

482
00:35:57,885 --> 00:36:00,096
I don't want to avoid responsibility.

483
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:10,940
I wonder what our job even is.

484
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,907
-Vodka tonic.
-Hey!

485
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:21,701
Listen.

486
00:36:21,784 --> 00:36:23,494
Don't ignore me.

487
00:36:24,036 --> 00:36:25,621
You're annoying. Go away.

488
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:26,580
What?

489
00:36:27,206 --> 00:36:28,624
-Watch it, you--
-Wait.

490
00:36:29,208 --> 00:36:31,335
-She's Risa Hirayama.
-Who?

491
00:36:31,419 --> 00:36:34,046
She was a pin-up model,
for a little while.

492
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:38,175
Yikes. And now she's drinking booze alone
at a place like this?

493
00:36:38,259 --> 00:36:40,303
Oh, what a poor thing.

494
00:36:40,386 --> 00:36:42,596
Hey, I have an idea.
How about you do porn?

495
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,307
You'll be way more successful.

496
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,267
-Good idea.
-Right?

497
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:48,477
Hey, relax.

498
00:36:49,562 --> 00:36:51,022
Hey! What's your problem?

499
00:36:51,981 --> 00:36:53,774
-Calm down!
-Stop it!

500
00:36:53,858 --> 00:36:55,276
-What the heck?
-Let go!

501
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,694
Let me go!

502
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:59,530
-Calm down!
-Let go!

503
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,053
RIKO, RIGHT?
THIS IS KANADE. CAN WE TALK?

504
00:37:40,154 --> 00:37:41,197
Hello?

505
00:38:02,885 --> 00:38:04,387
I'm sorry for the trouble.

506
00:38:20,277 --> 00:38:21,362
Why did you come?

507
00:38:22,196 --> 00:38:24,198
You think I deserve it, don't you?

508
00:38:24,281 --> 00:38:25,449
I don't.

509
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:28,077
You think I'm pathetic and miserable.

510
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,537
Look, I don't.

511
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,914
You do. You always have.

512
00:38:31,997 --> 00:38:35,376
You've always looked down on me,
like you knew better.

513
00:38:38,295 --> 00:38:42,174
You'd never understand how I feel.

514
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:48,013
Of course not!

515
00:38:51,976 --> 00:38:53,227
I never did.

516
00:38:54,603 --> 00:38:56,730
I didn't even try.

517
00:38:58,899 --> 00:39:02,153
I had no idea how you felt
as you continued struggling.

518
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:11,662
Even if you have the skill and work hard,
things don't always work out.

519
00:39:12,955 --> 00:39:17,668
No matter how desperate you get,
reality is all too often cruel.

520
00:39:23,966 --> 00:39:25,718
But you stayed true to yourself

521
00:39:27,428 --> 00:39:32,308
and did the best you could
without accepting defeat.

522
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,061
Isn't that right?

523
00:39:40,983 --> 00:39:41,942
That's why…

524
00:39:44,111 --> 00:39:45,070
I'm sorry.

525
00:39:47,156 --> 00:39:50,993
For not being able to notice anything.

526
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:59,001
It must have been so hard, all this time.

527
00:40:19,104 --> 00:40:20,523
You should come home.

528
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:24,860
Mom is worried about you.

529
00:40:43,462 --> 00:40:46,715
I still have unfinished business.

530
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,802
Unfinished business?

531
00:40:51,554 --> 00:40:53,305
I want to expose Aso.

532
00:40:57,351 --> 00:41:01,105
In the end, I can't forgive him.

533
00:41:05,526 --> 00:41:06,527
I want you…

534
00:41:08,237 --> 00:41:10,072
to write the article.

535
00:41:14,493 --> 00:41:15,536
Please.

536
00:41:56,493 --> 00:41:58,162
You monster!

537
00:42:12,718 --> 00:42:15,012
HARA FAMILY

538
00:42:15,095 --> 00:42:16,055
Hello?

539
00:42:27,024 --> 00:42:28,484
They are waiting for you.

540
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:29,485
Thanks.

541
00:42:34,365 --> 00:42:35,366
Ms. Riko.

542
00:42:36,325 --> 00:42:38,619
I'm sorry about last time.

543
00:42:38,702 --> 00:42:39,578
It's okay.

544
00:42:40,621 --> 00:42:42,790
The two of us talked things out.

545
00:42:43,707 --> 00:42:45,000
And we decided…

546
00:42:47,086 --> 00:42:50,506
I will tell you everything
that happened to me.

547
00:43:47,896 --> 00:43:50,858
Only one person knows
I'm investigating this story.

548
00:43:51,442 --> 00:43:52,609
PREVIEW

549
00:43:52,693 --> 00:43:55,362
I… I'll live my life my own way!

550
00:43:55,446 --> 00:43:57,364
THE SECRET PAST IS REVEALED

551
00:43:57,448 --> 00:43:59,700
She likely won't agree to settle.

552
00:43:59,783 --> 00:44:02,161
You think Kodama Productions
is behind this?

553
00:44:02,244 --> 00:44:04,163
CHANGING FACTS AS FAKE JUSTICE

554
00:44:04,246 --> 00:44:06,373
Do you really find that acceptable?

555
00:44:06,457 --> 00:44:08,500
I will never

556
00:44:09,418 --> 00:44:11,754
be able to regain control of my life.

557
00:44:11,837 --> 00:44:15,174
You mean Ioka is also involved in this?

558
00:44:15,257 --> 00:44:17,384
Are you Riko Hirata?

559
00:44:17,468 --> 00:44:19,887
I won't let Kodama Pro do as they please.

560
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:23,140
I can hear you out if you want.

561
00:44:24,892 --> 00:44:27,019
A SLIVER OF HOPE TURNS FATE AROUND

562
00:44:27,102 --> 00:44:30,272
I'll try one more time
to make this into an article.

563
00:44:30,355 --> 00:44:33,484
Ms. Yoko won't try to sabotage me again,
will she?

564
00:44:33,567 --> 00:44:34,485
You're still on that?

565
00:44:34,568 --> 00:44:36,111
What about my standing?

566
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,905
Ma'am!

567
00:44:38,822 --> 00:44:40,157
But how…?

568
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,993
THE TRUTH CHANGES INSTANTLY

569
00:44:43,577 --> 00:44:47,581
Let's put a stop to this absurd injustice.

570
00:44:47,664 --> 00:44:51,668
KANADE'S SISTER, RIKO HIRATA,
IS THE VICTIM OF THIS INCIDENT

571
00:44:51,752 --> 00:44:57,799
DARKNESS LOOMS OVER HER
AS A CRUEL TRAP PREYS ON HER EMOTIONS

572
00:44:59,593 --> 00:45:04,097
