00:00.000 --> 00:02.930
I thought you liked Chatfah all along.

00:03.150 --> 00:05.980
But people can always have a change of heart, right?

00:11.360 --> 00:12.900
Is the Mom we love so much

00:12.970 --> 00:15.430
the Mom we really know?

00:23.030 --> 00:25.030
The reason why Mom did that,

00:26.380 --> 00:27.930
no one knows it, right?

00:29.690 --> 00:30.760
No.

00:31.180 --> 00:32.550
No one knows,

00:33.640 --> 00:35.640
or no one wants to talk about it?

00:37.200 --> 00:39.700
What are you trying to say?

00:41.440 --> 00:43.180
No one wants to talk about it.

00:44.100 --> 00:45.620
Because they are scared.

00:47.530 --> 00:51.070
They are scared that we can’t handle the truth.

00:52.280 --> 00:55.770
They are scared that it will tear our family apart.

00:57.810 --> 00:59.340
But Chatfah,

01:00.060 --> 01:04.620
she is the only one
who has been searching for the truth.

01:21.330 --> 01:22.980
What happened?

01:26.310 --> 01:28.150
It fell down.

01:35.300 --> 01:37.720
The window is old.

01:37.770 --> 01:41.110
The hinges are probably old and broken.

01:43.340 --> 01:45.250
It’s fortunate that you are safe.

01:45.290 --> 01:47.650
I’ll call a handyman to fix it.

01:48.780 --> 01:49.780
Yes.

01:50.010 --> 01:52.020
(There are only two things…)

01:52.060 --> 01:55.770
(that can revive the heartbeats of a dead man.)

01:58.530 --> 02:00.930
If we stood at a slightly different spot,

02:01.620 --> 02:03.280
we would have needed a major face job.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.210
This is scary.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.560
(The first thing is soul-nourishing love)

02:18.940 --> 02:19.890
Chom.

02:19.920 --> 02:20.580
Huh?

02:20.620 --> 02:23.190
The hinges are not old like Aunty Chom said.

02:24.740 --> 02:29.430
(The other is an implacable grudge.)

03:42.150 --> 03:43.620
You should go wait inside.

03:43.660 --> 03:44.680
It’s hot out here.

03:45.820 --> 03:47.010
It’s okay.

03:51.700 --> 03:53.850
Why do people need to kill one another?

03:55.740 --> 03:57.180
It’s useless to think about it.

03:59.980 --> 04:01.980
We will never know the answer

04:03.810 --> 04:05.360
until we find the murderer.

04:23.770 --> 04:24.770
Here.

04:27.420 --> 04:28.420
Thank you.

04:56.060 --> 04:57.390
I can’t contact her by phone.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.740
Is this Bua’s phone?

05:06.110 --> 05:07.420
We found it in her room.

05:11.540 --> 05:12.550
Chom.

05:13.170 --> 05:15.580
Bua didn’t take her phone with her?

05:16.430 --> 05:18.780
She usually glues to her phone.

05:19.530 --> 05:22.160
There’s no way she would leave it behind.

05:22.420 --> 05:23.980
She might be in a hurry and forget it.

05:24.660 --> 05:27.830
Or she could be kidnapped.

05:34.620 --> 05:35.980
It’s my manager.

05:36.730 --> 05:37.890
It’s probably about the news.

05:38.700 --> 05:39.750
I need to take this call.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.490
We need to reexamine the crime scene,

05:53.020 --> 05:55.310
and question everyone.

06:00.370 --> 06:02.100
What should I say?

06:04.060 --> 06:05.540
I was with you last night.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.910
Just tell them the truth.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.970
Because that is what happened.

06:14.690 --> 06:16.690
How can I tell them that?

06:17.460 --> 06:20.140
You said we shouldn’t meet like that.

06:20.170 --> 06:23.270
It’s better for me to face punishment
than for you to become a suspect.

06:24.860 --> 06:25.860
It’s okay.

06:26.300 --> 06:27.300
Don’t worry.

06:46.380 --> 06:47.720
Hello.

06:48.650 --> 06:50.380
(Did you hear about Sarah?)

06:51.100 --> 06:52.250
What about her?

06:52.800 --> 06:55.620
(I couldn’t contact her.)

06:55.650 --> 06:57.870
(I just found out today.)

06:58.120 --> 07:00.360
(She is dead.)

07:07.740 --> 07:11.140
When was the last time you saw your uncle?

07:12.550 --> 07:15.080
I think it was a few days ago.

07:15.460 --> 07:17.100
Or maybe longer than that.

07:17.580 --> 07:18.970
I don’t really remember.

07:19.250 --> 07:23.190
Do you know if he had any enemies?

07:23.850 --> 07:25.040
I…

07:29.580 --> 07:30.580
I don’t know.

07:31.140 --> 07:35.310
Is it true that your sister was at odds with him?

07:42.570 --> 07:45.580
I don’t know much about
what happened in the company.

07:46.220 --> 07:47.490
On the night of the murder,

07:47.940 --> 07:49.940
where were you and who were you with?

07:51.460 --> 07:52.770
I…

08:03.240 --> 08:04.240
Miss. Miss.

08:04.650 --> 08:05.650
Miss.

08:06.180 --> 08:07.180
Yes.

08:08.060 --> 08:11.580
I know that you are still shocked about
what happened to your uncle and sister.

08:12.110 --> 08:16.000
But I need you to pay attention
and answer my questions.

08:18.980 --> 08:20.980
Yes, I get it.

08:21.920 --> 08:23.520
I’ll answer your questions.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.110
On the night of the murder,

08:25.140 --> 08:28.140
where were you and who were you with?

08:39.790 --> 08:40.790
Fire!

09:20.900 --> 09:21.900
Miss.

09:23.220 --> 09:24.910
Are you Sarah’s friend?

09:26.410 --> 09:27.410
Yes.

09:27.820 --> 09:29.530
We were under the same agency.

09:31.930 --> 09:33.930
Thank you for coming.

09:34.390 --> 09:37.170
Sarah would be happy to know
that her friend came to bid her farewell.

09:38.590 --> 09:40.740
Please go take a seat.

09:41.650 --> 09:43.430
You can sit over there.

09:43.470 --> 09:45.340
Hello. Are you Miss Sarah’s mother?

09:45.380 --> 09:46.220
Yes.

09:46.260 --> 09:47.360
Hello.

09:47.660 --> 09:50.130
We believe that she was very drunk.

09:50.580 --> 09:53.290
When the fire broke out,
she couldn’t escape from the nightclub.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.370
We still don’t know the cause of the fire.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.430
All the CCTV cameras in the club
were damaged by the fire.

10:00.270 --> 10:03.410
Her friends are still in a coma.

10:03.450 --> 10:04.790
They can’t give us any statement.

10:05.220 --> 10:06.220
Yes.

10:07.700 --> 10:10.400
But there’s a camera
at the parking lot across the nightclub.

10:10.450 --> 10:14.830
It captured the accident and the people
who went in and out of the nightclub.

10:14.860 --> 10:16.780
We are requesting the footage from the camera.

10:17.970 --> 10:20.570
This is not the first time
fire has broken out at a nightclub.

10:21.220 --> 10:22.860
To be honest,

10:22.890 --> 10:27.330
it’s not easy to find the cause of the fire.

10:27.390 --> 10:31.730
There are several cases where we can’t find
the cause of the fire or arrest the culprits.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.980
Have you ever heard about the fire
at the nightclub called Hide & Seek?

10:47.470 --> 10:48.470
Excuse me.

10:49.310 --> 10:50.990
Yes. How can I help you?

10:51.420 --> 10:53.840
I…

10:54.380 --> 10:56.260
Last night, I parked my car here.

10:56.290 --> 10:57.470
My belongings went missing.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.100
Can I see the footage from the camera?

10:59.140 --> 11:01.590
Yes, but you need to have a police report.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.040
Otherwise, I can’t let you see it.

11:03.650 --> 11:04.950
I need a police report?

11:04.970 --> 11:07.500
Yes, or you can use an incident report.

11:07.530 --> 11:08.980
Otherwise, we can’t show it to you.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.290
Okay. Thank you.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.570
It’s okay.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.400
Chom.

11:58.390 --> 11:59.640
When did you get in?

12:03.150 --> 12:04.540
A while ago.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.010
You were sleeping.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.200
I didn’t want to wake you up.

12:12.540 --> 12:13.680
So…

12:14.960 --> 12:16.330
why are you crying?

12:19.480 --> 12:20.760
Sarah.

12:22.760 --> 12:23.760
She is dead.

12:26.760 --> 12:30.170
On the night when the nightclub caught fire,

12:31.580 --> 12:33.580
she couldn’t escape.

12:34.720 --> 12:39.080
I don’t know what to do.

12:41.460 --> 12:43.760
So many things happened to me.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.760
Uncle Kajorn is dead.

12:49.480 --> 12:51.480
Bua is missing.

12:53.280 --> 12:56.250
The house I grew up in
became an unfamiliar place.

12:58.590 --> 13:01.190
But I am your alibi.

13:01.740 --> 13:04.160
You were with me that night.

13:07.490 --> 13:08.980
That’s not all.

13:11.610 --> 13:13.840
There’s a CCTV camera
in front of the nightclub.

13:15.130 --> 13:17.980
Police will find out that I was there that night.

13:20.660 --> 13:21.910
How about this?

13:22.500 --> 13:24.500
You just tell them the truth.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.930
You did that as self-defense.

13:32.410 --> 13:33.960
No one would believe me.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.980
Everyone believes what they want to believe.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.770
What the truth really is,

13:46.570 --> 13:48.110
no one cares.

13:51.060 --> 13:52.156
2022
How are you feeling, Chompoo?

13:52.180 --> 13:53.250
Are you nervous?

13:53.820 --> 13:54.820
Yes.

13:55.300 --> 13:57.400
It’s okay. Just relax.

13:57.430 --> 13:58.820
You practiced it several times.

13:59.650 --> 14:00.650
Alright.

14:01.490 --> 14:02.940
Everyone, please stand by.

14:02.980 --> 14:04.380
We are going live in 30 seconds.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.180
I’m rooting for you.

14:05.220 --> 14:06.020
You can do it.

14:06.050 --> 14:07.340
Thank you.

14:16.660 --> 14:18.060
Everyone, ready.

14:18.560 --> 14:23.160
Five, four, three, two, live.

14:23.210 --> 14:25.570
Welcome to the hourly news updates.

14:25.620 --> 14:28.190
Sitting with me is a trainee news anchor.

14:28.230 --> 14:32.600
She is the winner
of our station’s news anchor contest.

14:33.180 --> 14:35.880
Hello. I’m Chompoonuch Bupphachinda.

14:35.900 --> 14:38.100
Let’s check out today’s weather forecast.

14:38.150 --> 14:42.300
The weather forecast from
the meteorological department on 30 August.

14:42.350 --> 14:44.740
Rain is expected across the country.

14:44.780 --> 14:47.660
It may cause torrential and flash floods.

14:47.700 --> 14:51.190
For the news updates,
police raided a well-known model agency.

14:51.220 --> 14:55.140
The model agent lured aspiring artists
to have sexual intercourse,

14:55.180 --> 14:58.510
and secretly recorded videos to blackmail them.

14:58.540 --> 15:00.570
He was arrested earlier this morning.

15:00.590 --> 15:05.100
Police found dozens of videos of the victims.

15:05.140 --> 15:08.060
Some of the videos
are spreading on the internet.

15:08.100 --> 15:13.990
The agency is owned by Mr. Pongpiti,
also known as Pong.

15:29.700 --> 15:32.020
Stop the video and go to the commercial break.

15:32.060 --> 15:33.280
Turn it off.

15:41.280 --> 15:45.570
2016

15:49.910 --> 15:51.060
Hello.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.010
I’m sorry for being late.

15:53.030 --> 15:54.710
I remember all my lines.

15:54.740 --> 15:56.170
I’m ready for the audition.

15:56.200 --> 15:59.370
I’m going to tell you
that you don’t need to come in anymore.

16:00.110 --> 16:01.110
Why?

16:03.470 --> 16:05.220
Good. I really like it.

16:09.550 --> 16:11.310
I’m glad to work with you.

16:13.100 --> 16:15.220
I want to work with new faces.

16:15.260 --> 16:16.420
You give a fresh look.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.740
Well done, Chatfah.

16:19.640 --> 16:21.590
Thank you for giving me the chance.

16:21.970 --> 16:23.160
I’m a rookie.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.230
If you have any advice,
please feel free to tell me.

16:25.890 --> 16:26.890
Good.

16:28.100 --> 16:29.270
Chom, this way.

16:30.890 --> 16:33.570
Pong, this is my sister.

16:34.030 --> 16:35.030
She is single.

16:35.210 --> 16:36.240
Right.

16:37.180 --> 16:39.060
Chompoo, what do you want to drink?

16:39.090 --> 16:40.370
I’ll order it for you.

16:41.430 --> 16:43.180
I’ll have what Chat has.

16:43.730 --> 16:44.730
Okay.

16:50.590 --> 16:52.790
This is the important thing you want to tell me?

16:54.790 --> 16:56.580
He’s a model agent.

16:56.920 --> 16:59.980
I met him when I auditioned for a commercial.

17:00.970 --> 17:03.880
He is good-looking and nice.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.190
He saw you on my Instagram
and wanted to ask you out.

17:09.380 --> 17:10.380
But…

17:10.590 --> 17:11.860
he’s too old for me.

17:12.320 --> 17:13.840
I don’t want to date anyone right now.

17:14.420 --> 17:16.420
Just give it a chance and get to know him.

17:17.110 --> 17:18.750
If you don’t like him, you can block him.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.100
I think he is mature.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.260
He can protect you.

17:25.020 --> 17:26.540
2022
How could you play the video?

17:26.560 --> 17:30.380
Don’t you see that the woman in the video
is the same person as the news anchor?

17:31.350 --> 17:32.350
I’m sorry.

17:32.900 --> 17:34.760
I didn’t know they were the same woman.

17:35.470 --> 17:37.330
In the video, she looks very young.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.380
I didn’t recognize her.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.600
But I already blurred her face.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.300
Blurred her face, and what?

17:42.740 --> 17:45.510
Netizens will find out who she is.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.030
Delete the video.

17:47.460 --> 17:50.380
We cannot let the station’s reputation
be ruined more than it already did.

17:50.840 --> 17:51.260
Yes.

17:51.290 --> 17:52.290
You.

17:56.380 --> 18:01.410
I heard that you are Nathat’s friend.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.100
Yes.

18:04.340 --> 18:07.940
Did you win the contest
because of Nathat’s connections?

18:09.030 --> 18:10.290
No.

18:10.980 --> 18:12.770
He has nothing to do with it.

18:12.820 --> 18:15.030
He didn’t know that I joined the contest.

18:15.060 --> 18:17.540
People start digging.

18:17.580 --> 18:19.850
They think you got into this round

18:20.320 --> 18:23.140
because you’re my grandson’s girlfriend.

18:24.720 --> 18:27.560
I admit that I am the woman in the video.

18:28.570 --> 18:31.670
I didn’t know that he was filming me.

18:31.700 --> 18:34.180
If you didn’t give him a green light,
how could he film it?

18:34.900 --> 18:36.540
I was young.

18:37.620 --> 18:39.620
I thought he did that because he loved me.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.780
I didn’t know that it would turn out like this.

18:44.450 --> 18:47.740
Your behavior is a breach of contract.

18:48.780 --> 18:51.560
You ruin our company’s reputation.

18:52.390 --> 18:54.390
I will not sue you,

18:55.370 --> 18:59.670
if you stay away from my grandson.

19:13.990 --> 19:15.580
In reality,

19:17.180 --> 19:21.540
people judge others based on what they believe.

19:23.870 --> 19:27.580
If they judge you from what they see,

19:30.340 --> 19:32.120
then we don’t let them see anything.

19:39.700 --> 19:43.970
This is the statement of the members of
the Bupphachinda on the night Kajorn was killed.

19:44.990 --> 19:46.190
Read it yourself.

19:59.030 --> 20:00.660
If you have anything to ask me,

20:00.690 --> 20:02.010
just say it.

20:03.170 --> 20:06.500
If you have anything you want to tell me,
just say it.

20:07.410 --> 20:08.410
Okay.

20:09.130 --> 20:10.480
I’m going to tell you that…

20:11.910 --> 20:13.740
I did that to investigate the case.

20:15.210 --> 20:16.210
What else?

20:18.480 --> 20:20.480
I have no hidden agenda.

20:21.380 --> 20:22.380
I swear.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.160
With the middle sister?

20:26.230 --> 20:28.230
If you swore on your life, you would be dead.

20:30.650 --> 20:32.100
I told you everything.

20:32.640 --> 20:33.640
Why?

20:34.160 --> 20:35.960
Are you going to question me, too?

20:36.816 --> 20:39.096
If you were involved with the case,

20:39.152 --> 20:40.440
I wanted to question you.

20:41.600 --> 20:44.088
But she didn’t mention your name
in the interrogation.

20:47.020 --> 20:50.352
She said she was working at the office until late.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.176
But she has no witness to confirm it.

20:53.224 --> 20:56.912
So I’m going to check CCTV cameras
at her office.

20:56.944 --> 20:58.320
Are you going with me?

21:00.320 --> 21:01.328
Go with me.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.944
Have you ever seen these two women?

21:04.976 --> 21:05.992
No.

21:06.370 --> 21:08.248
If you see them, please contact me.

21:08.280 --> 21:09.184
Thank you.

21:09.216 --> 21:10.216
Sure.

21:20.016 --> 21:21.504
If you see them, please contact me.

21:21.528 --> 21:23.928
If you are interested, please call me.

21:24.740 --> 21:25.872
Have you ever seen these women?

21:25.896 --> 21:26.400
Thank you.

21:26.432 --> 21:28.392
- If you see them, please contact me.
- Thank you.

21:29.620 --> 21:30.776
Excuse me.

21:30.816 --> 21:32.384
Have you ever seen these women?

21:32.860 --> 21:34.568
If you see them, please contact me.

21:47.260 --> 21:49.860
I have a meeting with a realtor
to discuss my grandma’s land deal.

21:51.464 --> 21:53.824
Your grandma has been wanting
to buy the land for some time.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.672
Chat told me about it.

22:04.360 --> 22:06.472
I don’t want to only wait for their news.

22:07.240 --> 22:08.872
I want to do something.

22:09.670 --> 22:12.240
So I came to ask the local people here.

22:13.410 --> 22:14.728
You did the right thing.

22:16.820 --> 22:17.984
I’m sorry.

22:19.060 --> 22:20.744
I didn’t do anything to help you.

22:23.470 --> 22:24.752
There’s something…

22:25.530 --> 22:27.256
I never understand.

22:28.740 --> 22:30.544
Why both Chom and Chat…

22:31.550 --> 22:33.144
fell in love with you?

22:36.720 --> 22:39.584
When I see you living your life
like nothing happened,

22:40.456 --> 22:42.460
while Chat is still missing,

22:43.576 --> 22:45.580
Chom is going through a tough time.

22:46.430 --> 22:47.952
To tell you the truth,

22:48.340 --> 22:49.592
in my eyes,

22:50.410 --> 22:52.664
I feel really bad for them.

22:53.030 --> 22:54.728
They were fighting for you.

22:58.460 --> 22:59.944
You were not me.

23:00.580 --> 23:03.576
You would never understand what I went through.

23:04.530 --> 23:06.192
What about my sisters?

23:06.700 --> 23:08.856
Do you know what they are going through?

23:10.860 --> 23:13.984
You might be the cause
of everything that happened.

23:15.540 --> 23:17.952
But you pretend like nothing happened.

23:18.760 --> 23:22.104
My sisters did so much for you.

23:23.210 --> 23:25.048
You love your family.

23:25.088 --> 23:27.050
So do I.

23:28.540 --> 23:30.920
So this is my sisters’ fault?

23:31.224 --> 23:33.160
Because they love you?

23:35.660 --> 23:37.928
You were at Bupphachat Mansion that night, weren’t you?

23:43.460 --> 23:44.872
Chom didn’t tell me.

23:45.880 --> 23:47.280
It’s my speculation.

23:55.160 --> 23:56.256
Why?

23:57.100 --> 23:59.960
Why did you let Chom
go through everything alone?

24:01.000 --> 24:02.352
The pain…

24:03.160 --> 24:05.160
from finding out that you slept with Chat.

24:05.890 --> 24:07.576
Even today.

24:07.990 --> 24:09.144
Even right now.

24:09.980 --> 24:12.472
You still leave her to fight through it alone.

24:13.032 --> 24:14.336
You don’t understand me.

24:15.580 --> 24:16.776
I want to be with Chom.

24:16.808 --> 24:18.288
I want to take care of her.

24:20.510 --> 24:21.904
But I can’t do that.

24:22.790 --> 24:26.064
You should be there for her the most,
but you can’t do it.

24:26.112 --> 24:28.544
Then there’s no one else who can do it.

24:30.910 --> 24:33.136
Chatfah has a video from Chompoo’s birthday.

24:35.416 --> 24:37.696
The birthday at the nightclub.

24:40.410 --> 24:42.888
She has the video that recorded everything.

24:47.290 --> 24:49.096
Get up and drink.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.104
This is boring.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.064
Hey.

24:56.088 --> 24:57.176
She’s here.

24:59.940 --> 25:01.600
Why are you late?

25:01.632 --> 25:03.272
This is my birthday.

25:03.296 --> 25:04.248
I’m sorry.

25:04.272 --> 25:06.384
I went to have dinner with my friends.

25:06.744 --> 25:07.592
I’m mad.

25:07.632 --> 25:09.224
Don’t be mad.

25:10.816 --> 25:12.384
Where is the cake?

25:12.660 --> 25:13.660
Cake?

25:15.310 --> 25:16.496
I asked a staff member to keep it in the fridge.

25:16.520 --> 25:17.832
I’ll get it at midnight.

25:17.840 --> 25:18.584
Okay.

25:18.616 --> 25:19.616
Here.

25:19.720 --> 25:20.760
Because you are late.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.220
Drink it.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.712
Okay.

25:24.744 --> 25:25.744
Well done.

25:31.912 --> 25:33.024
Chom.

25:34.600 --> 25:35.856
Why are you this drunk?

25:35.896 --> 25:36.896
No, I’m not.

25:38.390 --> 25:39.608
She had this.

25:40.660 --> 25:41.660
What is it?

25:42.700 --> 25:43.700
Come on.

25:45.568 --> 25:47.264
Trust me.

26:03.784 --> 26:04.784
Girls.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.064
Bua and Dad are not here to keep an eye on us.

26:07.088 --> 26:09.864
Let’s get wasted tonight.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.264
Chom.

26:11.288 --> 26:12.512
Cheers.

26:12.552 --> 26:14.376
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.200
Come here.

26:20.420 --> 26:21.420
Have a seat.

26:26.910 --> 26:28.280
I need another drink.

26:30.200 --> 26:31.520
That’s enough.

26:31.780 --> 26:33.424
Stop drinking.

26:33.480 --> 26:34.944
Why are you drinking so much?

26:34.984 --> 26:36.940
I went to throw up and get it all out.

26:40.450 --> 26:43.480
I came here like a queen,
but will go back like a hot mess.

26:44.390 --> 26:45.856
Yes, you are a mess.

26:45.880 --> 26:47.168
Look at you.

26:48.130 --> 26:49.048
I’m not drunk.

26:49.088 --> 26:50.608
We can’t have another round of drinks.

26:50.800 --> 26:53.344
It’s midnight.

26:53.650 --> 26:58.032
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

26:58.064 --> 27:01.592
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

27:01.616 --> 27:03.320
♪ Happy birthday, happy birthday ♪

27:03.360 --> 27:05.384
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

27:05.416 --> 27:07.380
Look at me.

27:08.650 --> 27:10.024
I’ll make a wish.

27:11.270 --> 27:12.270
Police are here.

27:13.460 --> 27:15.160
Girls, let’s go.

27:18.580 --> 27:19.580
Come on.

27:33.400 --> 27:35.032
What should we do?

27:35.992 --> 27:37.990
Should we go out and act normal?

27:38.150 --> 27:39.576
Look at us.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.580
If we walk out,
they will send us for a drug test.

27:43.050 --> 27:44.232
No.

27:44.950 --> 27:46.752
Dad cannot know about this.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.560
Chat is a minor.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.296
I bribed a bouncer to get her in.

27:56.330 --> 27:57.176
The lighter.

27:57.272 --> 27:57.648
Huh?

27:57.960 --> 27:59.304
Give me the lighter.

28:08.824 --> 28:10.820
Chom, are you going to…

28:12.180 --> 28:13.464
Just make a small fire to help us escape.

28:13.488 --> 28:15.008
They can put it out before it spreads.

28:16.010 --> 28:17.152
You can’t do that.

28:17.176 --> 28:18.736
What if the fire spread?

28:19.870 --> 28:21.184
What else do you want me to do?

28:21.224 --> 28:22.440
You want us to be arrested?

28:22.472 --> 28:23.616
Dad will kill me.

28:23.648 --> 28:25.024
Dad will kill us.

28:25.048 --> 28:25.808
I can’t let that happen.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.000
Chom, calm down.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.376
I think we can find another way.

28:28.410 --> 28:30.056
Please, don’t do it.

28:30.096 --> 28:30.848
It’s dangerous.

28:30.888 --> 28:32.850
There’s no other way.

28:33.940 --> 28:34.920
No, Chom.

28:34.952 --> 28:35.968
There must be other ways.

28:36.008 --> 28:37.970
Calm down and think.

28:38.008 --> 28:39.552
We can find another way.

28:39.576 --> 28:40.664
Please don’t do it.

28:40.696 --> 28:41.664
Trust me.

28:41.688 --> 28:42.928
They can put out the fire.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.456
Chom, I’m begging you.

28:44.488 --> 28:45.832
There must be another way.

29:07.680 --> 29:13.848
Police are investigating the cause of the fire at Hide & Seek, a famous nightclub in Thonglor.

29:13.912 --> 29:17.872
Around midnight yesterday,
police raided the nightclub.

29:17.912 --> 29:20.696
The fire broke out at the back of the building.

29:20.736 --> 29:24.224
Police believe that the fire started…

29:26.560 --> 29:27.560
Chat.

29:29.860 --> 29:31.592
Aren’t we going to talk about this?

29:31.930 --> 29:33.368
Why do we need to talk about it?

29:33.400 --> 29:34.728
It has nothing to do with us.

29:37.300 --> 29:39.552
How can you say that? We…

29:39.568 --> 29:40.568
So what?

29:41.056 --> 29:43.060
Can you handle the punishment?

29:44.020 --> 29:45.480
We could go to jail.

29:45.512 --> 29:47.480
Dad might cut us off.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.368
You might feel guilty now.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.624
But you’ll be too scared
to face the punishment.

30:01.510 --> 30:03.552
Since none of us can handle it.

30:03.568 --> 30:05.550
There’s no point in talking about it.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.416
What happened last night.

30:08.630 --> 30:10.400
We were just those who were affected by it.

30:11.420 --> 30:12.896
We were victims.

30:13.630 --> 30:15.456
We didn’t start it.

30:15.730 --> 30:19.520
Are you saying you marry Chat…

30:19.940 --> 30:22.208
not because she said she was pregnant,

30:23.310 --> 30:25.528
but because she used that video to threaten you?

30:27.192 --> 30:29.190
I never slept with her.

30:30.048 --> 30:32.050
Why did she do that?

30:33.060 --> 30:36.440
She was there when the video was taken.

30:37.184 --> 30:39.180
Why did she use it to threaten you?

30:40.460 --> 30:42.800
The latter part of the video
didn’t capture what happened.

30:43.610 --> 30:45.256
Because Chat put her phone in her pocket.

30:46.370 --> 30:48.272
Only your conversation was recorded.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.056
Most of the conversation is about

30:52.136 --> 30:54.140
Chompoo saying she was going to do it.

30:55.780 --> 30:57.552
Based on the conversation,

30:57.600 --> 31:00.736
it sounded like she set the fire.

31:04.290 --> 31:05.576
But…

31:06.040 --> 31:08.296
Chat shouldn’t risk her life like this.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.632
Picha, don’t you see?

31:13.056 --> 31:15.060
Picha turned into someone who had no fear.

31:16.740 --> 31:18.776
To get what she wants,

31:18.824 --> 31:21.040
even if she needs to hurt herself,

31:21.880 --> 31:23.416
she’s willing to do it.

31:28.340 --> 31:32.600
Then why does she want to marry you?

31:33.990 --> 31:36.544
Look at everything she did.

31:37.640 --> 31:41.496
I don’t think
you are the only thing that she wanted.

31:42.320 --> 31:43.776
I don’t know.

31:49.200 --> 31:50.592
For me,

31:52.328 --> 31:54.330
Chat went missing.

31:56.024 --> 31:58.020
It could be a good thing.

32:05.170 --> 32:08.248
I deleted the footage
from the camera at my office.

32:09.184 --> 32:10.744
If police ask for it,

32:11.770 --> 32:13.544
I’ll tell them that the camera is broken.

32:14.616 --> 32:16.620
So there’ll be no proof that I lied.

32:27.270 --> 32:28.472
Why did you lie?

32:30.590 --> 32:34.000
Because you shouldn’t be dragged into this.

32:38.710 --> 32:41.456
This is not the only thing I lied about.

32:44.150 --> 32:46.336
I lied about that night, too.

32:51.260 --> 32:53.304
The night that Chatfah went missing.

32:56.310 --> 32:57.872
The truth is…

32:58.650 --> 33:01.400
I went to see her that night.

33:03.270 --> 33:04.864
She said…

33:05.530 --> 33:08.688
if I told her who killed our mom,

33:11.040 --> 33:13.160
she would give me some of the inheritance.

33:16.832 --> 33:18.830
But I didn’t know who killed our mom.

33:21.180 --> 33:23.736
Because I really wanted the house.

33:25.300 --> 33:28.048
I went to see her in her room.

33:29.980 --> 33:31.576
When I went in,

33:32.860 --> 33:34.432
she was not in the room.

33:37.728 --> 33:39.730
When Chatfah fell down,

33:41.090 --> 33:43.984
I went to my room
to get a towel to slow her bleeding.

33:45.510 --> 33:49.584
But I also deleted the message
saying I was going to meet her.

33:51.910 --> 33:53.928
I didn’t want anyone to know…

33:56.330 --> 34:01.128
how desperately I wanted the house,

34:02.770 --> 34:05.112
how much I loved it,

34:07.070 --> 34:09.392
and how attached I felt to it.

34:21.390 --> 34:23.648
But I couldn’t unlock her phone.

34:26.580 --> 34:29.448
So I hid her phone under the bed.

34:30.220 --> 34:34.168
Then I would delete the message later.

34:38.170 --> 34:40.170
The phone went missing.

34:42.720 --> 34:44.488
All this time,

34:45.190 --> 34:47.952
I’ve been living in fear.

34:50.300 --> 34:52.472
I started by lying about small things.

34:54.230 --> 34:56.384
Now, the lie is getting out of hand.

35:00.380 --> 35:02.380
I’ve been thinking this.

35:04.330 --> 35:07.704
If I weren’t worried about Chaftah’s phone,

35:09.570 --> 35:11.688
and I stayed with her,

35:13.990 --> 35:16.048
she wouldn’t go missing.

35:17.820 --> 35:20.648
Things wouldn’t get out of hand like this.

35:24.720 --> 35:25.912
I know.

35:29.790 --> 35:32.232
I know how pathetic I am.

35:34.300 --> 35:36.464
I was very selfish, right?

35:38.570 --> 35:40.192
Stop blaming yourself.

35:42.860 --> 35:45.824
All you need to do is tell the truth to the police.

35:51.330 --> 35:52.912
The truth is…

35:54.420 --> 35:56.064
I now realize…

35:58.780 --> 36:00.440
that we all…

36:01.860 --> 36:05.376
we’ve been trying to hide our wrongdoings.

36:07.072 --> 36:09.070
We started to attack each other,

36:11.620 --> 36:13.400
and betray each other.

36:16.560 --> 36:18.472
Now, things are falling apart.

36:23.850 --> 36:25.624
But I’m tired of it.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.880
I want to end it.

36:33.630 --> 36:35.672
I told you the truth.

36:37.180 --> 36:38.872
Because among all the people that I know,

36:40.470 --> 36:43.400
You are the last person
I want to misunderstand me.

36:44.500 --> 36:45.736
At least,

36:47.300 --> 36:52.168
I want you to see that
I still have something good in me.

37:04.640 --> 37:07.040
I’ll tell everything to the police tomorrow.

37:10.980 --> 37:12.320
Don’t worry.

37:13.240 --> 37:15.240
I won’t mention your name.

37:15.960 --> 37:18.424
I don’t want you to get into trouble
because of me.

37:40.650 --> 37:42.176
Everything that you said,

37:43.540 --> 37:45.064
do you really mean it?

37:45.464 --> 37:47.460
Or are you just trying to manipulate me?

37:48.940 --> 37:50.976
Why would I do that?

37:53.790 --> 37:54.790
I don’t know.

37:55.970 --> 37:58.472
Maybe because you want me
to help you with the case?

37:59.780 --> 38:01.840
Or you are just having fun because…

38:03.420 --> 38:04.760
you know how I feel about you.

38:07.860 --> 38:10.104
Do you think I’m having fun?

38:10.970 --> 38:14.416
I have to hide everything when I’m with you.

38:17.090 --> 38:20.336
Your job is to investigate me.

38:21.020 --> 38:23.408
You are the one
I should stay away from the most.

38:24.660 --> 38:26.152
But I don’t know why.

38:26.900 --> 38:29.928
Every time I turn back, I always see you.

38:31.120 --> 38:34.768
The person who is manipulative is you.

38:36.040 --> 38:38.408
You’ve been suspecting me.

38:39.420 --> 38:41.912
Why are you pretending to worry about me?

38:43.630 --> 38:44.630
Wait.

38:52.768 --> 38:54.000
I am not pretending.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.304
You are good at painting.

39:59.300 --> 40:01.448
I’m making a living out of it.

40:03.584 --> 40:05.784
Why don’t you send your work
to sell at a big gallery?

40:05.976 --> 40:08.352
Or why don’t you hold an exhibition?

40:09.140 --> 40:11.984
With your skill,
any gallery will want your work.

40:13.860 --> 40:16.512
I don’t like to be around people.

40:17.970 --> 40:19.496
I like to work on my painting alone.

40:19.850 --> 40:21.120
I like being alone.

40:27.350 --> 40:29.968
Then why did you jump into this chaos?

40:35.970 --> 40:36.970
I…

40:39.520 --> 40:40.792
I want to know…

40:42.180 --> 40:46.040
how great the power of love is.

40:49.750 --> 40:51.032
What do you mean?

40:56.000 --> 40:57.800
You lied to the police.

40:58.340 --> 40:59.780
You took the risk of being arrested.

41:00.950 --> 41:02.584
You did everything for the man you love.

41:07.392 --> 41:09.040
I just want to know…

41:10.670 --> 41:12.272
how long you will keep going.

41:14.120 --> 41:15.904
I think you already got the answer.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.560
Love is not that great.

41:23.560 --> 41:27.576
I think it was just my foolishness.

41:30.820 --> 41:32.392
When it comes to love,

41:34.760 --> 41:36.912
one of us is usually more foolish than the other.

41:38.910 --> 41:40.344
If you call it foolishness,

41:41.260 --> 41:44.384
It must be a great foolishness.

41:47.810 --> 41:49.168
I think…

41:51.660 --> 41:53.264
it’s not everyone

41:54.740 --> 41:56.384
that can do great things

41:57.470 --> 41:59.200
such as sacrificing themselves

41:59.660 --> 42:00.872
to help someone.

42:20.960 --> 42:22.056
I’m sorry.

42:23.480 --> 42:24.488
It’s okay.

42:27.760 --> 42:30.280
I’ll clean it up.

42:51.120 --> 42:52.120
Sorry.

42:52.680 --> 42:53.976
Did I wake you up?

42:55.540 --> 42:56.540
No.

42:57.230 --> 42:58.230
You didn’t.

43:06.680 --> 43:08.640
I thought you already went to the police station.

43:12.960 --> 43:15.248
I plan to go there today.

43:23.250 --> 43:26.912
This case has too many secrets.

43:33.590 --> 43:35.344
If you have to mention my name,

43:36.460 --> 43:37.608
just do it.

43:41.688 --> 43:43.320
I told you.

43:43.352 --> 43:45.528
I won’t get you into trouble.

43:49.130 --> 43:51.544
But I don’t want you to go through this alone.

44:02.060 --> 44:05.088
I believe in the justice system.

44:05.520 --> 44:07.136
It is fair for us all.

44:15.040 --> 44:20.592
But justice also means we need to face
the consequences of our actions, right?

44:32.250 --> 44:33.560
Yes, what’s up?

44:46.320 --> 44:48.544
We found a signal from Chatfah’s phone.

44:51.380 --> 44:54.272
Her phone is turned on.

45:01.670 --> 45:03.568
Her phone is turned on?

45:04.616 --> 45:05.440
Yes.

45:05.488 --> 45:07.024
Chain and I are going to check it.

45:15.090 --> 45:16.968
From the location,

45:17.000 --> 45:18.970
I don’t know how it got there.

45:30.480 --> 45:32.032
I want to go with you.

45:33.360 --> 45:34.616
You should wait here.

45:35.030 --> 45:36.344
I’ll keep you posted.

45:40.020 --> 45:41.032
I’ll be right back.

45:52.580 --> 45:53.696
I’m on my way.

45:54.250 --> 45:55.448
You don’t need to go.

45:55.760 --> 45:57.160
Team B will go there.

45:58.660 --> 45:59.968
What do you mean?

46:00.920 --> 46:03.424
I heard that you were dismissed from the case.

46:45.080 --> 46:49.184
(Turn weakness into rage.)

47:10.400 --> 47:12.136
(Turn foolishness…)

47:16.780 --> 47:18.408
(into courage.)

47:28.460 --> 47:33.584
(Even smart people can do foolish things)

47:42.608 --> 47:44.610
(Even though it is dangerous, )

47:49.350 --> 47:52.408
(we still try our best to get it.)

48:23.490 --> 48:25.120
(Even in the end, )

48:28.290 --> 48:30.664
(it doesn’t worth it at all.)

48:35.700 --> 48:36.736
Chom.

48:36.760 --> 48:37.760
Chompoo.

48:37.900 --> 48:40.504
Bua, if you can’t set a good example for your sister,

48:40.544 --> 48:42.144
they won’t listen to you.

48:42.176 --> 48:45.088
Someone put Chatfah’s phone in my case.

48:45.120 --> 48:46.904
Then place it in my room.

48:47.312 --> 48:49.280
Someone tries to frame me.

48:49.670 --> 48:51.248
Just make her disappear, right?

48:52.016 --> 48:52.944
Let me go.

48:52.968 --> 48:55.168
Now, I remember who it is.

48:55.208 --> 48:57.552
I didn’t expect that person would be this sister of yours.
