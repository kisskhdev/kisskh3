=Episode 2=

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.920
What are you doing, K?

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:51.960
Do you want to let her go?

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.000
Are you seeking death?

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.759
She's right.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.640
It's indeed useful to keep her.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.359
Let's enjoy her for a few days
before selling her to the rebels.

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:08.920
It's more beneficial.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.120
I'm impressed, K.

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:19.000
But I seem to remember

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.560
you don't like women, right?

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.480
How about letting me
have a taste of her first?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.319
She's quite to my taste right now.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.599
Let go of me! Put me down!

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.400
Let go of me!

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.280
Keep an eye.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.079
Kun,

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.519
that woman can't escape.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.040
I didn't mean that woman,

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.560
but K.

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.400
Tonight

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.280
he was a bit strange.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.240
Let go of me, you scoundrel!

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.520
Let go of me!

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.520
Instead of tormenting me,

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.759
you might as well kill me now.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.120
Want to die?

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.240
Where do you think this place is?

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.719
Where you can die because you want to?

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.680
Listen.

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:33.400
If you die,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.479
guess if I can find
your family and friends.

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:38.680
You beast!

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.599
Quite the commotion.

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:48.560
Beast?

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.800
Do you know what a beast is like?

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.039
Welcome to Tai City.

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:15.360
Do you want me

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.879
to take off your clothes
or you take them off yourself?

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:22.000
Whatever. I'll consider it a dog bite.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.360
Your mouth is tough,

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.120
but your body is soft.

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:36.599
Truly exciting.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.039
Keep screaming.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.479
Scream louder.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.919
What?

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:44.960
Or do you want me to make it real?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.639
Stop it.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.319
I'm not interested in you.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.240
But you have to keep screaming

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.639
so that people outside can hear you.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.600
It's indeed useful to keep her.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.240
Let's enjoy her for a few days
before selling her to the rebels.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.680
It's more beneficial.

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:28.680
(They are guarding outside.)

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.160
(How can I leave?)

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:36.680
(Get Peng Li's ledger,)

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.600
(and your task will be complete.)

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:44.759
Kun, what happened?

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:46.279
We have an intruder.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.680
A full search is needed.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.920
K!

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.720
K!

00:05:58.759 --> 00:05:59.560
Open the door!

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.560
K!

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.680
Open the door!

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:04.800
Did he go out?

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:05.879
No.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.920
We never left.

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:12.040
Kick it open.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.439
- No one here.
- No one here, either.

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:36.199
No one here.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.600
Kun, there's no one.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.399
No?

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:52.360
K.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.920
Why standing there?

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:11.240
Search!

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.560
Yes.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.959
Who let you in?

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.160
Search the room.

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:24.800
Don't you dare ignore me.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.160
We have an intruder.

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:27.879
All rooms must be searched.

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.800
Do you think a third person
could fit in such a small bathroom?

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.000
Still not leaving?

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.079
I advise you to search elsewhere.

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:41.839
Or the boss won't like your explanation.

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:43.959
Let's go.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.120
If it weren't for me,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.079
you'd have been dead.

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:07.480
What are you doing?

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:08.439
Do you want to die?

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:10.839
Give me your hand.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.480
What are you doing?

00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:23.680
Check the bathroom.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.600
You like biting people, huh?

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.559
This is my last warning.

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:58.279
If you run again,

00:08:58.279 --> 00:08:59.000
I won't save you.

00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:02.519
All that awaits you is death.

00:09:04.639 --> 00:09:05.519
Let me go.

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:07.000
So I won't cause you any trouble.

00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:12.600
On what grounds should I let you go?

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:17.320
You were not in the bathroom just now.

00:09:22.679 --> 00:09:24.240
Do you know what you are saying?

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:27.600
If they knew we were just acting,

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.039
what do you think they would think?

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.600
Are you threatening me?

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.399
If you let me go,

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:38.600
no one can threaten you.

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:42.799
Only the dead

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.159
pose no threat to me.
