WEBVTT

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.279
My true identity

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:15.599
is actually Gao Feng, the
president of Junsheng Group.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.840
You thought you were
asking me to pretend to be him,

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.919
but you were actually
looking for me all along.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.800
Not only do I possess immense wealth,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.360
but I am also a retired
special forces king.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.936
Those people from Sanhe Company

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.239
were defeated by me alone.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.080
They had no choice but
to pay back the money.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.759
As for Jin Zun Group's
so-called social connections,

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.439
they are nothing in front of me.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.679
It really is you.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:45.759
As if it's really you.

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:48.735
If I hadn't seen you delivering
food with my own eyes,

00:00:48.759 --> 00:00:50.719
I would've actually
been fooled by your lies.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.415
Why don't you believe me?

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:53.896
If you were nicer to me,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.799
maybe I'd even give you an autograph.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.976
Shut up.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.015
Fine, I won't say anything.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.000
Don't joke about my idol, Gao Feng.

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:02.039
Why won't you believe me?

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:03.200
I really am Gao Feng.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.159
If you really are Gao Feng,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.640
then I'm a fairy.

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:08.575
With how beautiful my wife is,

00:01:08.599 --> 00:01:10.279
calling her a fairy isn't an exaggeration.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.799
Stop being so glib.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.776
Are you going to say it or not?

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.976
You don't believe the truth,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.135
and you don't believe lies either.

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.359
So what do you want me to say?

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.599
Forget it, I won't say anything.

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:18.719
I'm going to sleep.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.239
Shouldn't a boss reward and punish fairly?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.120
I just recovered over twenty
million for the company.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.359
Shouldn't you at least
give me a token reward?

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.280
What more reward do you want?

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.760
The bed in the guest room is too hard.

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:37.000
I can't sleep well.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.176
How about tonight,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.840
I squeeze into your room?

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.560
A man and a woman alone in one room

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.239
if you can't control yourself,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.159
should I be understanding about it?

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.760
If you can't control yourself,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.120
I won't even charge extra.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.920
Keep dreaming.

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.199
Are you trying to murder your own husband?

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.039
My true identity

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.400
is actually Gao Feng, the
president of Junsheng Group.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.840
You thought you hired me to play a role,

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.640
but you were actually
looking for the real me.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.216
If you really are Gao Feng,

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.639
then I must be a fairy.

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:48.575
With how beautiful my wife is,

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.519
calling her a fairy wouldn't
be an exaggeration.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.599
What on earth is going on?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.896
Why is even Old Master Liu

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.720
showing so much respect
to that delivery guy?

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:16.520
Could it be

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.080
that he really is Gao Feng, the
president of Junsheng Group?

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.680
Impossible.

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:21.919
Absolutely impossible.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.719
The information here is very clear.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.479
He's obviously just a delivery guy.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.280
This doesn't make any sense.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.920
Old Master Liu isn't even
that respectful to his own father.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.439
How could he be so
respectful to a delivery guy?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.759
What is really going on here?

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:47.159
Young Master Song,

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:48.719
Young Master Song,

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:51.319
how did he even pay
off Jinzhun Group's debt?

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.759
What's happening here?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.175
My position as vice president

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:55.400
is probably not safe anymore.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.439
Why are you panicking?

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.960
Look at yourself, what
do you look like right now?

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.777
Ugh.

00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:01.455
How can I not panic?

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:02.296
Young Master Song,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.520
you have to help me think of a solution.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:06.199
Young Master Song,

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:07.120
it's been investigated.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.496
There's reliable information that

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.376
a supervisory team has
recently arrived in our Yun City.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.816
Their goal is to find out

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.720
who is protecting Liu
Shanhe behind the scenes.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.319
That's why Liu Shanhe has
been keeping a low profile lately.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.000
I knew it.

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:24.480
So that's how it is.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.000
The person backing them was investigated.

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:29.720
All the dirty deeds they've
done can't be covered up now.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.457
At a time like this,

00:04:31.481 --> 00:04:33.480
of course Liu Shanhe
wants to keep things quiet.

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:35.896
I was wondering why he'd go to
such lengths for some random guy.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.400
Why he'd be so willing to compromise.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.935
Turns out, he's just afraid
things will get out of hand.

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:41.519
And cause an even bigger scandal.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.519
Well played, Gao Xing.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.279
You almost fooled me
with your borrowed authority.

00:04:51.519 --> 00:04:53.160
But Young Master Song,

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.120
that Gao Xing is just a delivery guy.

00:04:57.519 --> 00:05:00.160
These kinds of secrets
among the upper class

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.920
not even I know about them.

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:03.720
How could he possibly know?

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.839
Are you stupid?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.840
Delivery guys are running
around everywhere every day.

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:09.319
If there's any gossip,

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:10.879
he knows it best.

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:12.399
Good thing I'm smart.

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:14.360
I wasn't fooled by him.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.680
Yeah, that's true.

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:16.959
Yeah, right.

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.480
So what should we do next?

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.560
One word:

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.639
Wait.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:23.800
Wait.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.016
Oh man.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.816
If we keep waiting,

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.855
what if I really lose my position
as deputy general manager?

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:28.879
Idiot.

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:32.439
Didn't Su Zhengchun make a deal with him?

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:35.160
He has to get sixty million in two days.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.560
Even if he collects all the debts,

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:39.759
it's only twenty million.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.320
As for the rest of the money,

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.279
if he can't fulfill tomorrow's bet,

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.920
he'll have to divorce Su Qingyan.

00:05:48.199 --> 00:05:49.456
He'll be kicked out of the Su family.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.519
And out of Qingmu.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.160
By then,

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:54.680
won't the deputy general
manager position still be yours?

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:57.759
That's right.

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:00.559
Young Master Song, Young Master Song!

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:02.879
Young Master Song!

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.639
You're the clever one.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.079
Forty million a day

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.576
even if it kills him,

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.920
he still can't pull it off.

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:27.959
Hello, An'an.

00:06:28.079 --> 00:06:29.175
How did the investigation go?

00:06:29.199 --> 00:06:31.055
Yesterday, I talked to three
different groups of people.

00:06:31.079 --> 00:06:33.079
I thoroughly looked into Gao Xing.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.560
You were right.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.360
He really is just a food delivery guy.

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:37.480
His family is poor.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.399
But he's not bad-looking.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.175
He only finished middle school and
has a rural household registration.

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:41.600
He hasn't had any proper jobs.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.976
After he came to Yuncheng,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.720
he's been making a living delivering food.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.120
Then why does Liu Shanhe
treat him so respectfully

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:49.296
and pay him back without any trouble?

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.560
That's simple.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.935
I heard there's an
inspection team around lately.

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:54.679
They're investigating Liu Shanhe's backers.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.879
He doesn't dare cause
any trouble right now.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.680
That's why he let Gao Xing intimidate him.

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:00.040
Oh.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.360
So that's how it is.

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:03.879
Alright, I got it.

00:07:25.079 --> 00:07:26.360
You can cook, too?

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.720
It smells pretty good.

00:07:31.079 --> 00:07:32.319
Are you hungry?

00:07:32.439 --> 00:07:33.560
Do you want to eat together?

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:35.720
There's some for me, too?

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:40.720
Is this to thank me

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:42.439
and you made it just for me?

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:45.815
Don't flatter yourself.

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:47.295
I made it for myself.

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:48.456
I just made too much
and didn't want to waste it.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.480
Really?

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.735
Why do I feel like someone is

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:53.096
saying one thing but meaning another?

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.759
Come on, are you eating or not?

00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:55.536
If not, forget it.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.360
I'll eat.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.519
Why wouldn't I eat?

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.759
It'd be a waste not to.

00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:15.040
Honey, let's go.

00:08:16.319 --> 00:08:17.137
Where are you going?

00:08:17.161 --> 00:08:18.281
I'm going to work at Qingmu.

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:19.615
I'm the deputy general
manager at Qingmu now.

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:20.536
I have to set an example.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:21.576
I can't be late or leave early.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.319
Stop messing around.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.040
I have something important to do today.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.279
What's so important?

00:08:25.879 --> 00:08:26.935
We're husband and
wife, we're in this together.

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:27.959
Tell me.

00:08:28.439 --> 00:08:29.600
I'll help you solve it.

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:32.960
Even though you helped
me with over twenty million,

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:33.817
And An'an,

00:08:33.841 --> 00:08:35.601
also invested another
ten million in Qingmu.

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.919
But we're still short
by over twenty million.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.440
Today is the last day.

00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:42.320
So I plan to try my luck at Tiange Group.

00:08:42.399 --> 00:08:43.080
Tiange?

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.200
Yeah.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.960
Tiange Group is the top
conglomerate in our province.

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.376
They have strong financial power.

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.936
Their market value exceeds ten billion.

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.736
If they

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.399
are interested in our Qingmu project,

00:08:52.759 --> 00:08:54.799
then our funding gap will be solved.

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:55.919
That's easy.

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:57.039
Just take me with you.

00:08:57.559 --> 00:08:58.696
With me, Gao Feng, taking the lead,

00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.816
no matter who it is,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.416
they'll have to show your
husband some respect.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.135
I had you pretend to be Gao Feng

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:05.200
to fool my family and Song Haoyang.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.096
If you claim to be Gao
Feng outside as well,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.320
that would be fraud.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.759
So I have to handle it myself today.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.159
But according to the bet,

00:09:14.799 --> 00:09:17.319
the funding issue for Qingmu
will probably fall on me to solve.

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:18.376
If you go by yourself,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.240
what if your family
refuses to acknowledge it?

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.615
Just take me with you.

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:22.960
Maybe I can help solve something.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.279
Alright.

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:26.399
Then come with me.

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:28.279
But remember,

00:09:28.759 --> 00:09:31.320
you must follow my instructions
in everything you say and do.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.376
Don't speak carelessly.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.855
And absolutely do not
mention that you are Gao Feng.

00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:34.879
Do you understand?

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:37.279
Don't worry, I'll handle it properly.

00:09:41.039 --> 00:09:41.559
Hello?

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:42.720
Hello, Zhou Pengfei.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.456
The boss has personally
come to your Tiange Group.

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.600
Hurry up and go greet him.

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:46.919
What?

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.320
The boss is here in person?

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.480
I'll go right away.

00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:50.559
Hey, wait.

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:52.816
This time, the boss is coming incognito.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.655
You need to be smart about it.

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:54.679
Did you hear me?

00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.840
Got it, got it.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.655
I've been waiting for a long time too.

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:03.216
We've all been waiting a long time.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.240
Yeah.

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:06.799
These are all the heads of
major groups in Yuncheng.

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:09.360
They're all here to
collaborate with Tiange Group.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.735
But President Zhou of Tiange
Group is extremely busy.

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:14.360
Not just anyone can meet him.

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:17.775
Whatever, let's just line up first.

00:10:17.799 --> 00:10:18.799
Okay.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.976
Mr. Zhou has important
matters to attend to today.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:24.855
He is not available to meet guests.

00:10:24.879 --> 00:10:25.879
Everyone, please leave.

00:10:28.679 --> 00:10:29.719
Let's go, let's head back.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:30.919
It's over.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.200
Do you know

00:10:32.279 --> 00:10:33.655
the strength of these company bosses

00:10:33.679 --> 00:10:35.119
is even greater than ours at Qingmu.

00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:37.039
Even they were turned away.

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.000
We probably have even less of a chance.

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:43.096
Isn't this the one from
the engagement party

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.440
who ran away from the
wedding in public, President Su?

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.440
What,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.176
now that you don't have
the Song family's help,

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.200
you're here to try to
get in with Tiange again?

00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:51.495
Even we can't get in.

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:53.039
You should stop daydreaming.

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:53.639
Hey,

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.679
my wife is different from you all.

00:10:55.879 --> 00:10:56.656
You all come to Tiange

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.440
to beg Tiange for a
chance to make a living.

00:10:58.519 --> 00:10:59.360
But my wife comes to Tiange

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:00.759
as a favor to Tiange.

00:11:00.919 --> 00:11:02.199
If Zhou Pengfei knew about this,

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.840
he would come down to greet her himself.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.297
What a big mouth.

00:11:05.321 --> 00:11:06.375
Where did this clown come from?

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:07.440
Talking so big,

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:09.559
aren't you afraid you'll bite your tongue?

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:11.240
Zhou himself would come greet you?

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.840
Who do you think you are?

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.759
Can you stop bragging?

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.360
I'm not bragging.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.080
You're not bragging?

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.416
Then where is Mr. Zhou?

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.039
Why hasn't he come down to greet you?

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:22.296
This guy is just talking big.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.735
He's even convinced himself.

00:11:23.759 --> 00:11:25.440
Mr. Zhou is here!
