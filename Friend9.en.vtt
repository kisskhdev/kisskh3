WEBVTT

00:01:35.417 --> 00:01:36.709
Shopping’s all done?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.042
Yeah.

00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:41.626
Didn’t you say you were happy?

00:01:41.626 --> 00:01:43.250
Why are you sitting here like this then?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.918
Falling for someone who’s already taken

00:01:50.083 --> 00:01:54.626
It's going to be sad like this.

00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:57.250
Will you be my girlfriend for a day?

00:02:29.292 --> 00:02:30.125
I’m gonna head out now.

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.876
Jin'll head back into the shop first.

00:02:37.876 --> 00:02:39.459
Alright

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.209
So what’s going on? Spill it.

00:02:50.417 --> 00:02:53.125
Let me shower first, then I’ll tell you.

00:03:19.542 --> 00:03:21.918
Uh… Khun Lalin?

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:26.167
Where’s Kanit?

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:29.834
I’ll go get her.

00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:42.918
Kanit! Kanit!

00:03:42.918 --> 00:03:45.876
It’s Khun Lalin—Khun Lalin!

00:03:45.876 --> 00:03:47.375
Huh? She’s here to see Kanit?

00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:49.542
Yeah, hurry up.

00:03:49.542 --> 00:03:51.959
Take care of this for me.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.709
Huh? How could you drink this?

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:19.459
What happened?

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.834
What?

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:23.500
Hey! Don’t play dumb.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.000
Why were you walking around together so early in the morning?

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:29.999
Don’t tell me that…

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:31.751
You knew?

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:36.125
Just guessed. So what?

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:43.918
Seriously, Lalin?

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.500
Keep your voice down.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.667
Don’t want the whole world to hear, do you?

00:04:55.292 --> 00:04:57.792
Lalin…

00:04:57.792 --> 00:05:00.876
What’s going on between you and Dr. Lan? I don’t get it.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.417
I don’t know…

00:05:10.417 --> 00:05:14.250
it’s like…

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.500
some deep feeling.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.751
I haven’t felt like this in a long time.

00:05:21.918 --> 00:05:24.834
Come on…

00:05:28.584 --> 00:05:32.250
You’re just looking for heartbreak, Lalin.

00:05:32.918 --> 00:05:35.334
What are you gonna do now?

00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:41.125
I don’t know.

00:05:41.626 --> 00:05:43.834
Let me ask you straight

00:05:43.834 --> 00:05:45.209
Do you have feelings for Dr. Lan?

00:05:48.292 --> 00:05:52.751
Ugh, this is driving me nuts.

00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:02.292
And Kanit?

00:06:03.918 --> 00:06:06.959
Why you living with Jin? Are you dating?

00:06:07.751 --> 00:06:09.500
No.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.751
She had some issues with her place

00:06:12.751 --> 00:06:15.209
So she’s staying with me for now.

00:06:19.083 --> 00:06:22.125
She could stay in the staff dorm.

00:06:22.918 --> 00:06:27.042
It’s fine. Better she stays with Kanit.

00:06:27.042 --> 00:06:31.125
That girl’s super clueless.

00:06:31.334 --> 00:06:33.042
She might cause problems for the resort.

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:37.667
She’s Kanit’s staff. I can take care of her.

00:06:44.042 --> 00:06:45.834
That’s odd.

00:06:45.834 --> 00:06:50.709
Kanit’s super possessive of your place— didn’t even let me in.

00:06:50.918 --> 00:06:53.000
Kinda sus.

00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:58.250
It’s not like that!

00:06:58.250 --> 00:06:59.959
Just don’t tell anyone, alright?

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:02.375
Yeah

00:07:02.375 --> 00:07:04.542
Lalin's is the same.

00:07:04.542 --> 00:07:06.500
Tell Jin too

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:09.667
don’t spread this around. Got it?

00:07:09.667 --> 00:07:10.751
okay

00:07:12.167 --> 00:07:14.959
But...

00:07:18.626 --> 00:07:20.876
If it gets too much, just walk away.

00:07:20.876 --> 00:07:22.959
I’m saying this as a friend.

00:07:29.417 --> 00:07:30.999
What’re you looking at?

00:08:15.876 --> 00:08:17.334
Sigh Life.

00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:26.834
P’Thienhom.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.292
P’Thienhom.

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:40.292
Yes, so the renovation will follow the specs I mentioned.

00:08:47.125 --> 00:08:50.500
Ah, I have a meeting. Will call you back later.

00:08:59.834 --> 00:09:02.250
Is something wrong?

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.626
No.

00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:33.500
P’Thienhom

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.918
I come to pick up the veggies. Are you done cutting them?

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:40.250
Not yet. Hang on a bit.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.125
How’re you doing with P’Peach?

00:09:46.167 --> 00:09:49.375
Still not great.

00:09:49.375 --> 00:09:51.000
Still feeling pretty down.

00:09:53.083 --> 00:09:56.500
What about you and Arm?

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.334
Made up yet?

00:09:57.709 --> 00:10:01.250
Not yet. I haven’t had the chance to talk to her.

00:10:02.042 --> 00:10:03.125
That’s okay.

00:10:03.125 --> 00:10:05.834
You too.

00:10:06.792 --> 00:10:08.999
Why are you lay on the table?

00:10:08.999 --> 00:10:10.250
It's not your business.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.584
I’ll go get the veggies. Just wait here.

00:10:14.584 --> 00:10:15.417
What’s with you?

00:10:38.125 --> 00:10:41.334
Doesn’t look comfortable at all. Why’ are you laying here?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.999
Here, let me help.

00:10:56.999 --> 00:10:58.876
It’s okay, Kanit.

00:10:59.083 --> 00:11:00.709
It's okay. I want to help.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.876
You done with the bills?

00:11:03.876 --> 00:11:07.209
All done. Of course—Kanit’s not slow like Jin.

00:11:09.292 --> 00:11:14.167
Come on, I’ll go instead.

00:11:14.167 --> 00:11:16.292
But…

00:11:16.292 --> 00:11:18.083
You go clean that table.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.459
Fine.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.667
You free?

00:11:36.918 --> 00:11:38.959
Careful, that might break.

00:11:39.209 --> 00:11:43.999
I’m telling you, I’m a pro at dishwashing.

00:11:43.999 --> 00:11:45.792
Are you bragging?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:46.999
It’s true!

00:11:51.083 --> 00:11:52.542
Jin

00:11:52.542 --> 00:11:54.876
someone’s here to see you.

00:11:54.876 --> 00:11:56.000
Who is it?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.417
No idea. Go check.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.292
Okay, thanks.

00:12:04.083 --> 00:12:05.125
Be right back.

00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:24.459
P’Jean? What are you doing here again?

00:12:24.459 --> 00:12:25.626
Mom told me to come get some money.

00:12:26.584 --> 00:12:29.042
You don’t transfer money to Mom anymore, huh?

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:33.250
Can you go back for now?

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.500
I’ll handle it today.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.000
This is my workplace—I don’t want to cause a scene.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.500
Why be embarrassed?

00:12:39.751 --> 00:12:41.918
I work too, you know.

00:12:41.918 --> 00:12:44.792
How many times have you lied to me that you’d handle it?

00:12:44.834 --> 00:12:48.042
Ever picked up the phone? I’ve called you like a hundred times!

00:12:48.876 --> 00:12:50.959
I said I’d handle it today.

00:12:50.959 --> 00:12:53.000
The customers are watching.

00:12:53.542 --> 00:12:55.375
Let them watch.

00:12:55.375 --> 00:12:58.792
They should know you’re an ungrateful daughter.

00:12:58.792 --> 00:13:00.500
Mom asks for a little help and you never give it.

00:13:00.834 --> 00:13:02.834
Never?

00:13:02.834 --> 00:13:04.417
I just gave her 10,000 baht.

00:13:04.417 --> 00:13:07.918
And when you asked, I gave you 2,000.

00:13:07.918 --> 00:13:10.792
Now what more do you want from me?

00:13:11.417 --> 00:13:13.876
I don't know

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.959
I want 5,000.

00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:18.918
Get it for me and I’ll leave.

00:13:18.918 --> 00:13:20.500
It’s mid-month.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.542
Where am I supposed to get that?

00:13:24.542 --> 00:13:29.000
Oh perfect—your boss is here.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.500
I’ll just ask for an advance.

00:13:32.709 --> 00:13:37.542
Madam, my sister wants to get a 5,000 baht cash advance.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.375
Cash only, no transfers.

00:13:40.375 --> 00:13:43.584
Hey, that’s crossing the line.

00:13:43.584 --> 00:13:45.876
You know saying that not only gets you no money

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.584
Jin also won't get a job.

00:13:47.876 --> 00:13:48.751
So what?

00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:51.083
I want 5,000.

00:13:51.083 --> 00:13:52.459
You get it for me

00:13:52.459 --> 00:13:55.667
I’ll leave. I don’t even wanna be here long.

00:13:55.667 --> 00:13:57.375
Jin doesn’t have it.

00:13:57.751 --> 00:13:58.918
Just go.

00:13:59.667 --> 00:14:04.000
You gonna walk out peacefully or should I call security?

00:14:05.876 --> 00:14:07.834
Fine.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.334
I knew you wouldn’t give it to me.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.959
Hey, Jin.

00:14:41.083 --> 00:14:42.375
So stingy.

00:14:52.626 --> 00:14:55.375
Stingy people deserve this.

00:14:56.209 --> 00:14:57.751
You’re going too far!

00:14:57.876 --> 00:15:00.334
This is a workplace, not your house!

00:15:00.334 --> 00:15:02.542
I know, I’m not a kid.

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:08.417
I got my revenge.

00:15:10.751 --> 00:15:12.542
I’m out.

00:15:12.542 --> 00:15:15.209
And don’t forget to transfer me the money!

00:15:22.626 --> 00:15:23.792
Jin…

00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:28.959
Tuk, Som, please help get the place back in order ASAP.

00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:30.792
I'll take you home?

00:15:30.792 --> 00:15:31.876
Okay.

00:15:34.584 --> 00:15:36.709
Come on, Jin. Let’s go home.

00:15:43.417 --> 00:15:46.667
Ignore the others. Let’s head to the car.

00:15:50.542 --> 00:15:52.125
Thanks.

00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:04.167
Let’s hurry and clean up the shop.

00:16:22.918 --> 00:16:25.834
Som, Tuk, are you okay?

00:16:27.792 --> 00:16:29.584
We’re fine, Khun Lalin.

00:16:32.584 --> 00:16:36.626
I was with a customer—didn’t think it’d turn into such a big deal.

00:16:37.459 --> 00:16:39.083
It’s okay, Khun Lalin

00:16:40.542 --> 00:16:42.167
What about Jin and Kanit?

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:44.000
Kanit took her home.

00:16:47.167 --> 00:16:48.083
Just a little bit here

00:16:48.083 --> 00:16:49.542
Hmm, just a little bit more.

00:16:49.542 --> 00:16:50.042
Here, let me wipe it for you.

00:16:50.042 --> 00:16:51.125
You’re all okay, right?

00:16:51.125 --> 00:16:53.792
we are alright.

00:16:54.709 --> 00:16:56.626
That was intense.

00:16:56.999 --> 00:16:58.209
Just a little bit.

00:16:58.209 --> 00:16:59.999
How’s everyone doing?

00:16:59.999 --> 00:17:01.918
Dawan and Dr. Lan rushed over when we heard.

00:17:02.125 --> 00:17:04.250
Have you reported to the police yet?

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:05.542
Not yet.

00:17:05.542 --> 00:17:07.959
Should I go and report it to the police first?

00:17:07.959 --> 00:17:11.167
Lalin, go to the police station first. Lan will go with you.

00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:13.667
Dawan, wait for me at the room, okay?

00:17:14.209 --> 00:17:15.042
Sure.

00:17:17.334 --> 00:17:19.959
Wait, Lalin asked me to look at the shop for a moment.

00:17:19.959 --> 00:17:21.292
Go report it to the police first and then come back.

00:17:21.626 --> 00:17:23.167
Got it.

00:18:21.334 --> 00:18:22.959
Go take a shower, alright?

00:18:31.209 --> 00:18:32.999
Thanks.

00:18:41.959 --> 00:18:44.042
Don’t overthink things.

00:21:56.667 --> 00:21:59.542
Jin! Jin!

00:21:59.542 --> 00:22:00.626
Jin!

00:22:01.292 --> 00:22:02.626
Jin!

00:22:02.999 --> 00:22:04.792
Why’d you do that?

00:22:05.626 --> 00:22:07.584
Why would you try something like that?

00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:16.999
I was just… sad.

00:22:26.542 --> 00:22:28.209
Don’t ever think like that again.

00:22:37.375 --> 00:22:39.459
I wasn’t trying suicide.

00:22:43.542 --> 00:22:47.751
I just wanted to go into the water, clear my head.

00:22:52.167 --> 00:22:54.209
Well, I’m here now.

00:24:42.375 --> 00:24:44.918
Jin, anything from class you didn’t get today?

00:24:44.918 --> 00:24:46.876
You can ask me.

00:24:46.876 --> 00:24:47.999
I got it.

00:24:49.209 --> 00:24:51.667
You sure “got it” means you really got it?

00:24:52.709 --> 00:24:54.334
Yeah, really.

00:24:54.334 --> 00:24:58.209
Thanks for always helping me review stuff.

00:24:58.209 --> 00:25:01.500
My grades have been improving all because of you.

00:25:02.417 --> 00:25:06.584
So… have you thought about what you’ll do after graduation?

00:25:08.751 --> 00:25:11.209
Probably go back and work with Khun Lalin.

00:25:11.209 --> 00:25:14.709
It’s close to home, and also…

00:25:14.709 --> 00:25:16.500
I want to repay her family.

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:19.876
They helped me so much—supported my studies and everything.

00:25:20.876 --> 00:25:24.083
What about you? Where will you work after graduation?

00:25:24.792 --> 00:25:28.042
Probably here in Bangkok.

00:25:29.042 --> 00:25:31.834
we’ll still see each other?

00:25:32.167 --> 00:25:35.999
Of course. Bangkok and Khao Yai aren’t far at all.

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.542
Let’s go for a walk.

00:25:42.667 --> 00:25:43.667
Bright?

00:25:45.167 --> 00:25:46.000
Kanit?

00:25:47.918 --> 00:25:49.542
You study here?

00:25:49.834 --> 00:25:53.292
Yeah, almost done. Just met you here

00:25:54.083 --> 00:25:55.792
But at least we ran into each other.

00:25:56.083 --> 00:25:58.083
Where’re you going?

00:25:58.999 --> 00:26:00.999
Just for a walk.

00:26:01.334 --> 00:26:05.042
But never mind that—wanna grab a bite and catch up?

00:26:05.542 --> 00:26:06.500
Sure.

00:26:12.792 --> 00:26:16.417
I think she probably forgot she made plans with you.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.083
No way, she didn’t forget.

00:26:19.083 --> 00:26:20.918
P’Lalin never goes back on her word.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:23.375
Never in the past

00:26:23.375 --> 00:26:25.584
It doesn't mean that you won't break your promise.

00:26:26.959 --> 00:26:29.083
Are you gonna contradict me on everything?

00:26:29.083 --> 00:26:29.999
No.

00:26:30.375 --> 00:26:33.250
If you’d stay in reality, I wouldn’t have to.

00:26:33.751 --> 00:26:37.834
But seriously… it’s been 3 years. Are you crazy?

00:26:37.834 --> 00:26:39.667
You’ve liked her all on your own this whole time.

00:26:39.999 --> 00:26:43.375
How can you put up with that? I don’t get you at all.

00:26:43.709 --> 00:26:46.542
You wouldn’t get it. You’ve never been in love.

00:26:47.417 --> 00:26:49.999
Who says? Who says I’ve never been in love?

00:26:49.999 --> 00:26:53.375
I’ve been hurt by love so bad, I don’t want it anymore.

00:26:54.375 --> 00:26:58.334
I just don’t want you to get hurt the way I did.

00:26:59.959 --> 00:27:02.125
Okay… but then why don’t you try to find someone new?

00:27:03.584 --> 00:27:06.125
No. I don’t want to go through that again.

00:27:09.334 --> 00:27:13.584
You’re scared of getting hurt, so you don’t let anyone in.

00:27:13.918 --> 00:27:16.999
Come on, Linlin. You’re super cute.

00:27:16.999 --> 00:27:19.709
Just try falling in love again.

00:27:20.209 --> 00:27:23.334
I’m not ready. I’m good like this.

00:27:24.334 --> 00:27:25.542
Sure.

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:30.626
Go home? are you gonna wait till the library close?

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:35.334
I can wait. You can go ahead.

00:27:35.334 --> 00:27:37.083
Thanks for staying with me.

00:27:47.542 --> 00:27:49.626
Yes, P’Lalin.

00:27:49.626 --> 00:27:50.959
Dalan

00:27:51.709 --> 00:27:53.709
I can’t make it today.

00:27:54.876 --> 00:27:55.834
I’m really sorry.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:03.000
Is something wrong, P’Lalin?

00:28:04.083 --> 00:28:05.500
Where are you right now?

00:28:08.167 --> 00:28:09.792
Do you want me to come see you?

00:28:16.751 --> 00:28:18.626
Linlin, I’m heading out.

00:29:19.918 --> 00:29:21.834
Why are you crying?

00:29:34.209 --> 00:29:36.125
Why didn’t you pick up your phone?

00:29:37.375 --> 00:29:39.417
I’ve looked all over campus for you.

00:29:50.667 --> 00:29:52.667
Who made you cry?

00:29:57.042 --> 00:29:58.834
You don’t have to tell me.

00:30:39.584 --> 00:30:44.999
Can you look at me with love in your eyes just once… ?

00:30:48.209 --> 00:30:50.834
I promise I won’t ever hurt you.

00:31:14.959 --> 00:31:16.209
What’s your name?

00:31:16.751 --> 00:31:17.876
Jin.

00:31:18.542 --> 00:31:19.584
Jin

00:31:19.584 --> 00:31:21.334
do you want something to eat? I’ll order for you.

00:31:22.459 --> 00:31:23.751
Anything’s fine.

00:31:26.459 --> 00:31:29.876
This is the hardest answer to give.

00:31:29.876 --> 00:31:32.626
Because we don't know what the respondent wants.

00:31:33.209 --> 00:31:35.000
It’s fine, I’ll just order.

00:31:35.209 --> 00:31:36.792
Then I’ll get—

00:31:36.792 --> 00:31:38.167
You don’t have to order for yourself.

00:31:38.167 --> 00:31:41.042
I already know. I’ll go order now.

00:31:45.542 --> 00:31:48.751
I think I should head home now.

00:31:49.167 --> 00:31:53.209
What? Jin! Then who’s gonna go home with me?

00:31:53.209 --> 00:31:54.292
Well…

00:31:54.292 --> 00:31:56.375
I know you feel bad

00:31:56.584 --> 00:31:59.042
but we’re going home together no matter what.

00:31:59.042 --> 00:32:00.250
Alright?

00:32:01.584 --> 00:32:02.542
Okay.

00:32:08.918 --> 00:32:11.584
Red velvet, and Thai tea with less sugar for you.

00:32:12.042 --> 00:32:13.500
This is your orange cake, Jin.

00:32:13.876 --> 00:32:15.083
Thanks.

00:32:17.542 --> 00:32:20.751
Bright, you’re amazing. You still remember what Kanit likes.

00:32:21.083 --> 00:32:23.375
Of course. I remembers everything.

00:32:32.918 --> 00:32:35.083
Jin, eat. Bright bought it just for you.

00:32:39.918 --> 00:32:41.500
And Kanit, you better finish everything.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.792
If you don’t, I’m not letting you go home.

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:48.792
If I gain weight, I’m blaming you.

00:32:48.792 --> 00:32:50.167
Blame away!

00:32:50.167 --> 00:32:51.834
It’s been forever since we’ve seen each other.

00:32:51.834 --> 00:32:54.626
You can punish me however you want—I’ll take it.

00:32:57.667 --> 00:32:59.751
I’m heading home now, Kanit.

00:33:00.167 --> 00:33:03.292
What? Jin, who’s gonna go home with me then?

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.209
Then… can I bring you home, Kanit?

00:33:07.209 --> 00:33:10.417
Jin, you can go first. I’ll take care of Kanit.

00:33:11.459 --> 00:33:14.125
See you, Kanit. Thanks, Bright.

00:34:10.751 --> 00:34:13.209
Basic factors include natural resources

00:34:13.209 --> 00:34:16.000
climate, location, and population.

00:34:16.125 --> 00:34:21.125
Advanced factors include transportation, infrastructure,

00:34:21.334 --> 00:34:25.709
skilled labor, and R&D efficiency, etc.

00:34:30.459 --> 00:34:32.417
Jin, were you listening to what I was reviewing just now?

00:34:33.834 --> 00:34:35.792
Yeah, listening.

00:34:40.542 --> 00:34:42.959
Okay, It's enough for today

00:34:51.167 --> 00:34:54.083
You’ve been off all day.

00:34:54.083 --> 00:34:55.667
Is something wrong?

00:34:56.417 --> 00:34:58.209
Nothing,

00:35:06.834 --> 00:35:07.459
Kanit…

00:35:09.709 --> 00:35:11.959
You going anywhere after class?

00:35:11.959 --> 00:35:13.209
Wanna grab dinner with me?

00:35:13.834 --> 00:35:16.292
Not today, I have to head home. Next time

00:35:16.459 --> 00:35:21.125
Aww, come on. Please? go eat with me

00:35:21.918 --> 00:35:24.292
I’ve gotta go eat dinner with my mom.

00:35:25.209 --> 00:35:26.584
then I’ll head out.

00:35:26.709 --> 00:35:28.250
Hey—Jin, where you going?

00:35:28.959 --> 00:35:30.542
Ditching me again?

00:35:30.876 --> 00:35:33.334
Okay fine, no dinner.

00:35:33.334 --> 00:35:36.417
But at least let me walk you to your car.

00:35:42.834 --> 00:35:45.667
Here’s your matcha honey lemon and pink milk.

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:49.709
Who said I want matcha honey lemon?

00:35:49.918 --> 00:35:51.667
And who said I bought it for you?

00:35:52.999 --> 00:35:56.834
Oh, I've never raised you with my friends.

00:35:56.834 --> 00:36:00.375
With him, you're such a spender.

00:36:00.959 --> 00:36:02.209
Then what do you wanna drink?

00:36:04.542 --> 00:36:06.042
Blueberry smoothie.

00:36:06.459 --> 00:36:08.667
One blueberry smoothie, please

00:36:08.667 --> 00:36:10.167
but paying for yourself.

00:36:10.542 --> 00:36:12.959
Hey, I thought you were treating me.

00:36:16.792 --> 00:36:19.459
already paid for 2 drinks

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.292
Don’t tell me to go home today.

00:36:33.292 --> 00:36:35.709
Once I get my smoothie, I’m leaving anyway.

00:36:36.792 --> 00:36:37.834
Are you mad?

00:36:38.999 --> 00:36:40.918
I’ll treat you next time.

00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:45.000
Mmm.

00:37:00.918 --> 00:37:03.334
Hey, Dalan. Wait long?

00:37:05.209 --> 00:37:08.250
I already ordered you a matcha honey lemon!

00:37:09.375 --> 00:37:11.834
Show me the QR code, I’ll pay you back.

00:37:11.834 --> 00:37:13.417
It’s okay, it’s on me.

00:37:14.792 --> 00:37:17.792
No, I can’t let you pay for me.

00:37:18.792 --> 00:37:21.375
It’s alright—I want to treat you.

00:37:24.334 --> 00:37:25.500
Thanks.

00:37:27.209 --> 00:37:29.125
Aren’t you let me tutor you today?

00:37:29.584 --> 00:37:33.876
I actually understood today’s class, so I won’t bother you.

00:37:34.209 --> 00:37:36.167
You deserve a break.

00:37:37.792 --> 00:37:39.751
Drink your matcha honey lemon.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.083
It’ll help you feel better.

00:37:45.959 --> 00:37:47.876
Do I look that stressed?

00:37:49.083 --> 00:37:50.792
Just a little.

00:38:06.417 --> 00:38:09.292
Drink up, so you feel better. no worry

00:38:52.167 --> 00:38:55.292
By the way, how’s your mom?

00:38:55.292 --> 00:38:57.417
I haven’t seen her for so long.

00:38:57.417 --> 00:38:59.918
Her spaghetti’s so good though.

00:39:00.792 --> 00:39:03.876
She’s doing fine—still strict as ever.

00:39:03.876 --> 00:39:06.709
Say the wrong thing and she’ll scold me

00:39:06.709 --> 00:39:10.292
Can I come over for dinner at your home then?

00:39:15.918 --> 00:39:17.584
What! Don't you see me?

00:39:18.417 --> 00:39:20.542
Going to come over for dinner?

00:39:49.375 --> 00:39:52.751
Oh, Jin. Why doesn't she go back?

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Is that Kanit’s friend? She seems a little odd.

00:39:56.125 --> 00:39:59.209
Bright, don’t say that about Kanit’s friend.

00:39:59.209 --> 00:40:02.167
I wasn’t. Why are you jumping to defend her?

00:40:11.584 --> 00:40:15.125
Kanit, you’re still here? Where are you heading to?

00:40:15.918 --> 00:40:17.751
Going home—promised my mom.

00:40:17.999 --> 00:40:18.918
I’ll take you then.

00:40:19.167 --> 00:40:21.000
It’s okay, I’ll take her.

00:40:21.042 --> 00:40:22.125
Then I’ll go with you.

00:40:22.459 --> 00:40:25.459
Stop arguing—my mom’s waiting.

00:40:25.459 --> 00:40:26.042
Let’s go.

00:40:51.125 --> 00:40:53.500
Are you going anywhere after this, Dalan?

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:54.918
If not, I’m heading back.

00:40:55.918 --> 00:40:57.000
Not really.

00:40:57.584 --> 00:40:59.667
Can I go with you?

00:41:00.751 --> 00:41:02.709
I’m heading back to my condo.

00:41:03.125 --> 00:41:04.626
Yes, I go with you.

00:41:05.709 --> 00:41:06.667
Dalan!

00:41:20.876 --> 00:41:22.000
What are you doing?

00:45:16.918 --> 00:45:17.834
Dalan!

00:45:18.083 --> 00:45:18.542
Dalan!

00:45:23.834 --> 00:45:25.000
Sorry!

00:45:27.542 --> 00:45:28.667
You’re like a little kid.

00:45:48.876 --> 00:45:50.083
You got me soaked!

00:45:50.792 --> 00:45:52.375
Thanks—but I’m not giving this sweater back!

00:46:08.667 --> 00:46:10.417
We’re almost graduating…

00:46:11.542 --> 00:46:13.167
I have something to say.

00:46:16.709 --> 00:46:17.876
I like Kanit.

00:46:21.125 --> 00:46:22.834
middle school student?

00:46:28.459 --> 00:46:33.459
I think this necklace is super pretty. It’d look great on…

00:46:35.459 --> 00:46:37.709
This necklace suits Kanit.

00:46:37.709 --> 00:46:39.751
It’s cute—just like you.

00:46:40.167 --> 00:46:42.292
Ughhh, that’s so cheesy.

00:46:56.417 --> 00:46:58.209
Kanit is my first love.

00:46:59.042 --> 00:47:01.918
The one and only in my heart.

00:47:04.292 --> 00:47:08.584
My whole heart belongs to you, and no one else.

00:47:10.918 --> 00:47:13.709
Ugh, ghoosebump.

00:47:27.959 --> 00:47:29.792
just give it to you.

00:48:23.292 --> 00:48:27.167
I really likes you, Kanit.

00:48:29.042 --> 00:48:31.042
We’re about to graduate…

00:48:31.042 --> 00:48:33.167
I scared of missing the chance again, like last time.

00:48:34.417 --> 00:48:36.125
I’ve always wanted to see you again.

00:48:42.083 --> 00:48:43.542
Where are you going, Jin?

00:48:45.292 --> 00:48:49.417
What if I tell her and she rejects me? What do I do then?

00:48:49.417 --> 00:48:51.334
Well, it’s better than not saying anything at all.

00:48:52.292 --> 00:48:55.125
I really hope she accept your love.

00:48:56.751 --> 00:49:00.334
So… what you want to say is—You like me?.

00:49:04.542 --> 00:49:08.209
I’ve been liked you since the day you covered my skirt with your sweather

00:49:08.999 --> 00:49:11.459
Ever since that day

00:49:11.876 --> 00:49:14.876
I’ve never stopped liking you.
