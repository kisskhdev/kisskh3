00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.880
Making noodles.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.560
Who were you talking to?

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.080
It was about

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.120
an order.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:50.560
Better?

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.200
I'll get you some hot water.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.160
I put some cold water.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.800
Try it.

00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.600
Heading out later?

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.360
No,

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.360
making your noodles.

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.400
Quick-fried, okay?

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.280
Two eggs.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.920
I'll go prep.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.320
Remember,

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.640
stay calm, no outbursts.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.160
Got it.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.120
I'll stay quiet.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.360
Good. Leave it to me.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.280
That's her.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.960
Answer it.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:44.680
Bag here?

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:08.040
Room's untouched.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.960
Everything's the same.

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:30.760
[Can we talk?]

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:32.960
Sure.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:34.520
Such chemistry between us.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.480
You knew I'd be

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.320
worried sick and

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.920
arranged sick leave.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.400
You have not yet

00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.640
passed the trial period yet.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.880
Weren't you all about

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:50.600
staying in China?

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.680
Build a proper life

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.560
and work hard?

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.360
I've been working on

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.120
your mom daily.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.120
She's finally

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.560
softening up.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.040
Isn't this

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:06.400
going too far?

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.400
C'mon, explain.

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.040
A...a friend's

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.080
grandmother died.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:20.160
[I helped for a few days.]

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.680
Friend?

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:23.840
Guy or gal?

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.680
Guy.

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:26.760
A guy?

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.760
You're dating someone?

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.360
No, just a friend.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:42.960
Not even your boyfriend?

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.920
Why you get involved

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:46.400
in his family's funeral?

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.040
Mom, listen.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.800
His family's in a real mess.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.640
No one's helping him.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.160
He's really having

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.400
a hard time.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.120
Oh yeah?

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.720
What about showing

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.040
some concern for us?

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.120
Your dad worked

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.560
his ass off for your education!

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:02.600
You snuck back,

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.440
he defended you,

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.440
[and said you've matured,]

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:08.560
[become]

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.240
[responsible.]

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.600
Now you've got a job,

00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.440
act like it!

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:19.920
You've always

00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.360
[been this way from day one!]

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.680
No commitment to anything!

00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.240
Piano lessons are

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.600
a perfect example!

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.920
It cost 20 grand back then for the piano!

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.400
That was a year's income

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.240
for some.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.000
And for what?

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.120
So you could practice

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.720
anytime at home

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:35.840
instead of

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.880
going all the way

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.520
to the piano studio,

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.560
barely touching the keys.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.560
What came of it?

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.280
Why are we

00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:42.240
talking about piano...

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.160
Your dad

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.560
drove all over

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.960
Lucheng City,

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.760
hunting for

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.080
the best teachers!

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.640
Enough now.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:49.160
Right?

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.000
Hundreds per lesson!

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.400
Hundreds!

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.080
Alright, alright.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:53.840
[You...]

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:55.200
[good for nothing]

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.280
[little brat!]

00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:57.360
[Just]

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:57.960
[go back]

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:58.720
[to Canada!]

00:16:58.880 --> 00:16:59.360
[Let me talk to her...]

00:16:59.360 --> 00:16:59.800
[Don't push me!]

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.720
[Let me handle this.]

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.880
Calm down, calm down.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:14.000
Your mom's

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:14.800
just worried.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:17.200
She wants the best for you.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.680
That's why she brought up

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:21.599
the piano...

00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:31.960
Dad,

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.600
I tried so hard

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.360
[with the piano!]

00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:40.560
Six whole years.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.640
Three hours every day!

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:43.800
I swear.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.360
I'd even dream about music sheets!

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.920
But I just couldn't get it.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.920
I'm not talented.

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.040
What could I do?

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:52.920
I worked hard

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.160
in Canada too,

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.720
and got my degree!

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.720
Mom keeps bringing up

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.160
how

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:01.880
expensive my education was.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.040
I know all that,

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.480
Dad!

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.160
I just...took two days off...

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.240
Alright, alright.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.000
She's always

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.600
like this!

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.960
Please talk to her.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.600
Ask her to stop

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.520
pushing me?

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:19.600
[Pushing you?]

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:21.840
[You heard]

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.400
[what she's saying?]

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.240
Heaven knows...

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.840
We gave you everything

00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.120
we possibly could!

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.840
And we never

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.960
asked for anything back

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.360
despite all our sacrifices!

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:37.640
We don't even expect you

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.320
to care for us in our old age.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.840
Mom just wants you

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.440
to have a good life,

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.120
a good future!

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.360
Am I wrong

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:46.600
for that?

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.200
[Mom, you did nothing wrong.]

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.880
It's...it's all my fault,

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:52.600
OK?

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.520
Dad!

00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:55.520
I...I've

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:56.640
said enough.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.400
I don't...

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.520
I'm done talking...

00:18:58.520 --> 00:18:59.240
I'm leaving.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.160
I can't explain it right.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.760
Mom, listen to me,

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.480
[failure]

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:06.520
[doesn't mean]

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.840
[no effort at all.]

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.040
[Just because]

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:10.160
[I'm not exceptional]

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.920
doesn't mean

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.760
all your

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.920
years of sacrifice

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.320
were for nothing.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.680
It's not like that!

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.480
[What a brat,]

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.480
[talking like that!]

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:21.960
Stop right there!

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.920
Alright, alright,

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:24.000
let her go.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:24.480
Come back!

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.360
Enough, let her go.

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.240
It's raining...

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.560
Enough.

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.480
Stop, Lu Xinying!

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.160
Hey,

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:32.640
come on,

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:33.400
everyone's too

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.240
worked up.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.200
I hardly said anything!

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:38.120
OK, OK.

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.680
What did I do wrong?

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.720
You've done nothing wrong.

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:41.720
My fault.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.320
I messed up from the start.

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.960
I was speaking in your shoes, too!

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:45.920
Yeah, I know.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.000
Calm down, OK?

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:48.360
There, there,

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.040
relax.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.800
We must toast our Ace,

00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:28.760
Ms. Lin Anran!

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.600
Here's to your new show

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.840
crushing it

[and your career]

Mr. Lin and Ms. Qian,

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.600
thanks!

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.160
You're crushing it!

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.400
The platform needed sponsors,

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:53.480
[and you secured them]

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.880
[yourself.]

00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.360
You're one of a kind!

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.760
My gratitude to you, Mr. Lin.

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.800
Platform picked me

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.720
because of your effort.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.960
You're the real MVP!

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.000
You guys

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.520
are the dream team.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.920
Exactly!

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.480
Let's drink

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:18.800
to our

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:19.960
[brilliant partnership!]

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.600
Hold up.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:24.320
I've

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:26.600
got something

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.760
on my mind.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.920
Go ahead,

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.040
we're like family here.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.320
Well then,

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.600
my followers, sales,

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:39.720
and business deals

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.720
have been growing

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:43.520
these past six months.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:45.680
Think we could

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:47.960
talk about

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.040
bumping up my cut?

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:49.920
Anran,

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.840
we just signed for

00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:52.640
five years last year.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.240
Plus, you've already

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.200
made way more

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.800
than other

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.000
top streamers.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.640
Hey, she's earned it.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.520
True.

00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.400
Anran,

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.480
you're Tide Media's

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.160
greatest asset.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.120
From now on,

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.760
let's run this ship

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.760
together!

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.240
We'll chart a course toward

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.240
a bright future!

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.320
This

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:27.680
sounds promising,

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.600
better not be all talk.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.200
I'll drink to that!

00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.520
Ms. Qian,

00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.640
take a photo for us.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.600
I gotta post this!

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.720
1, 2, 3!

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:50.360
Anran,

00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:51.760
everyone's

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:52.440
waiting in your live

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.640
to party with you.

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.120
Xiaojian got a

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.400
massive cake!

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.200
Ms. Qian...

00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.640
Look, boss,

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.160
do yourself a favor

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.840
and check Lin Anran's contract again.

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.880
Give her a bigger cut

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.440
and we're

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.880
shooting ourselves in the foot.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:24.880
Ms. Qian,

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.840
top dogs don't

00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:29.600
stay on top forever,

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.560
and underdogs

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.320
don't always stay down.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.040
Congrats, Anran!

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.640
Thanks guys!

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.440
Congrats!

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:47.400
Thank you all!

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.640
Real success

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.480
is when

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.480
the numbers

00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:53.960
keep climbing.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.960
Once you've peaked,

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.800
it's all downhill,

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.840
and that's when it really hurts.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.840
I promised her leadership,

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.720
not better terms.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:15.880
Mr. Lin,

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.920
our newbies

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.320
are killing it.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.800
Beauty and fitness

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:23.200
are rock solid,

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:24.880
just like tech

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:25.960
predicted.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.080
Some comedy creators

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.480
are really taking off.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.520
Zhang Ran's already number seven.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.720
The "Desperate Personal Shopper"?

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.440
Yeah,

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:43.120
former

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.360
TV presenter.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.200
Ms. Qian,

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.080
do you think Zhang Ran

00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:50.240
and Lady Tiger

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.240
would click?

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.400
For sure.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.160
Done deal then!

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.360
Check these likes,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.240
the comments, views...

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.760
This is called mega-influencer.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.080
She's top three

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:08.800
on Little White Sail's comedy list.

00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:12.320
Girl's got game!

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:14.280
Gotta step up our game.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.880
The collab with Lady Tiger gonna be

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.640
your ticket

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:19.480
to the big leagues!

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.440
Be humble.

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.560
This level

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.000
takes serious work.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:29.680
We got this!

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.000
Tough journey.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.120
Need stress snacks.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.640
We're totally in this together!

00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.440
Dude, seriously?

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:00.960
I said get changed.

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.120
This is what you chose?

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.400
How was I supposed

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.240
to know about this

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.200
random dinner?

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.840
And what's wrong with this?

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.480
You said to be formal,

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.560
I literally graduated in this.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.760
Super formal!

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:20.680
You can't

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.080
rock the same suit forever.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.400
It's practically

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.560
a museum piece.

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.720
People distress jeans,

00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:30.400
not suits!

00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.880
Come on,

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:32.880
let me get you

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.720
new ones in a few days.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.160
Nah.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.560
Company's paying.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:38.080
Still your money.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:39.640
Makes me

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:40.640
feel awful.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:42.800
Like I'm walking around

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:43.720
with pieces

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:44.960
of your house

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:46.160
on my back.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:47.040
Too much pressure.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:47.760
No thanks!

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.920
That's quite

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.720
the metaphor.

00:28:58.040 --> 00:29:00.280
But you're our front man now,

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.560
got it?

00:29:01.560 --> 00:29:03.000
Looking sharp

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.480
is literally

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:06.560
part of your job.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:07.760
Funny job.

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:09.480
I'm just hanging around all day

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:10.480
with zero

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.520
actual work.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.600
Hey, today's work, isn't it?

00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.800
Stuffing your face's work?

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.720
This isn't just dinner, dude.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.480
It's networking.

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.720
You're an exec now,

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:22.960
y'know?

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.320
Real business

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.120
happens at the dinner table,

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.280
not in meetings.

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.120
Learn the game!

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.240
Business...

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:33.640
Who makes deals

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.400
drunk?

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.960
That's when

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.880
all the good deals happen!

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.000
It doesn't make sense.

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.360
Wearing my house, funny!

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.320
Trust me,

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:52.560
a Canadian PhD

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.600
is next level!

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:54.720
Mr. Li, Mr. Fu, please.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:55.760
Mr. Xing.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.840
About time!

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.360
Come on.

00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:00.480
Sit.

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:02.600
They are

00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.640
cosmetics industry's

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.440
rising stars,

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.280
CEO,

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.240
Mr. Fu Yudong!

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:12.680
Good evening.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.480
And President Mr. Li Daoqi!

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:17.480
Real up-and-comers here.

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.520
Gents, look out for these two!

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.000
You got it!

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.080
Mr. Chen from Wishstar Capital.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:24.560
Mr. Chen.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.000
And Mr. Wang of Flora Partners.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.520
- Mr. Wang.
- A pleasure.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.120
Get to know each other!

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.680
Let's shake on it!

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.600
Great to meet you.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.760
Pleasure!

00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.960
Hey there!

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.560
Nice to meet you!

00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.040
Welcome aboard!

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:43.240
Alright.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.360
People do crossed-arm toasts,

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.000
this is the first time

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.480
I've seen crossed-arm handshakes!

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.160
Crossed-arm toast?

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.640
Never heard of it!

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:51.280
Why don't you

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.120
show us

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:54.040
with Mr. Chen?

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.640
Let me see how it's done?

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.280
Stop it, Mr. Xing!

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:57.720
I'm skipping

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.840
your next party!

00:30:59.000 --> 00:30:59.960
Can't let that happen!

00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.440
Stick with us

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.360
decent guys instead.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:04.920
You?

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.280
A decent guy? Since when?

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.480
Always been!

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.160
OK, Mr. Chen.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:10.440
Just don't forget

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.520
your promise!

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.480
You got it!

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.240
So

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.840
which one of you

00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:21.960
is our Canadian PhD?

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:22.800
Mr. Fu!

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:23.600
Uh, that's...me.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.440
I'm Fu Yudong.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.400
Dr. Fu!

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.560
Right, right, my bad.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.800
Your brand's

00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:30.640
"Dr. Fu", right?

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.040
Yeah.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.160
Guys,

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:35.000
I love making friends

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.640
with smart folks.

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.400
Mr. Xing's description of you

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.240
caught my interest,

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.520
so I asked him

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:41.800
to arrange this.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.120
Let me

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.280
introduce the crew.

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:47.480
Painter from the Fine Arts Academy,

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:47.960
Lili.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.920
Nice to see you.

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.960
Principal dancer at the Lucheng Ballet,

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.320
Qingqing.

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:52.920
Hello, hello.

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:54.760
And Feifei,

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.200
curator of our Arts Center.

00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:59.440
All top talents!

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.880
Time for a toast.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.000
C'mon, everyone.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:04.840
C'mon.

00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:06.280
Pour it up!

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:08.720
Fill those glasses!

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:09.920
I'll stick with wine.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.240
Go for the liquor.

00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:13.400
So sorry!

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:14.320
Not much of a drinker.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.600
Sorry, liquor's not my thing.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.560
Such a character,

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.360
our Dr. Fu!

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.280
Let's go!

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.520
Cheers, guys!

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.640
Down it goes!

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.920
Got plenty of wine too!

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:24.520
Awesome!

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.400
C'mon, get comfy!

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.280
Now,

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.640
let's hear

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:33.880
what Mr. Chen's got to say!

00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.880
Hey

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:38.400
Dr. Fu,

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.160
red wine

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.160
all night?

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:44.160
No way!

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.440
Switch to the hard stuff!

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:46.320
Wine's the hardest

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.880
I can do.

00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.280
He's not a drinker.

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:49.920
Oh yeah?

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.920
I'll take it.

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.160
To you!

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.240
Now you're talking!

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:55.240
Drink up!

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:55.960
Sure!

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:56.520
Great!

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.320
Next time, it's liquor for you!

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.600
Yeah, definitely!

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.080
You good?

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:02.880
You sure?

00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:04.040
When's that crossed-arm toast?

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.720
C'mon, knock it off!

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.720
Bathroom break.

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.560
You're being honest!

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.440
Down it! All the way!

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.640
Watch me!

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.640
More, more!

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:24.880
Already?

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:26.920
He's a drinker!

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:28.680
C'mon!

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.800
Keep it coming.

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.560
Mr. Chen.

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.480
Alright.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:35.960
Mr. Wang,

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.520
maybe ease up?

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.960
Gotta drink!

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:39.960
Where'd you run off to?

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.560
Sorry,

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.240
bathroom.

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.400
Did you drink?

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:43.320
Fine, I'll drink!

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:44.840
Know what this is for?

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.400
Just for wiping.

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.600
Nah,

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:49.200
I'll show you a trick.

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.240
Still

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:52.800
waiting on

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.280
that crossed-arm drink!

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.600
Drop it already!

00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.640
Sorry everyone,

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.040
I'm late.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.520
Ms. Yu!

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:03.800
our star singer's

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:04.680
finally here!

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.600
Wasted!

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.360
So this is?

00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.520
I'm good.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.679
I'm Mr. Xing's friend,

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:10.440
teach opera at the music institute.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.840
The food won't cut it!

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.760
Waiter!

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.679
Mr. Yu, order anything you like.

00:34:14.679 --> 00:34:15.880
I already ate.

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:16.440
OK.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:16.840
I'll

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:17.920
make it up

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.159
to you all,

00:34:19.159 --> 00:34:20.199
let me belt one out.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:20.920
Sweet!

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:23.000
She's amazing!

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.800
I'll perform a section

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.840
from an opera.

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:29.880
What's up?

00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:32.719
This ain't what you said.

00:34:32.719 --> 00:34:33.679
More like a party

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:34.800
than business.

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.280
We're late to the game,

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:36.880
bet

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.199
they sorted it earlier.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:41.040
Just keep smiling.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.120
Should've taken it easy!

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.280
Here,

00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:47.240
rinse.

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:49.520
Are you OK, Mr. Li?

00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:50.360
Better?

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.320
Just finished puking.

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:53.880
Much better now that it's out.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:54.760
OK.

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:55.680
All good, no worries.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.800
Ready to go?

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.640
Driver's almost here.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.600
Driver's coming?

00:35:58.600 --> 00:35:59.040
Yeah.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:35:59.520
Let's roll!

00:35:59.720 --> 00:35:59.880
OK.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.080
Take it easy!

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:02.080
I'm fine. Don't help.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:03.040
I'm good.

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.480
Watch this straight line!

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.040
See that line there?

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:06.760
I can

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.800
walk it!

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.280
Keep it down!

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:26.680
Almost home!

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.080
Get back inside!

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.640
Stop being crazy,

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.440
Jesse's laughing at you!

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.320
Got it all

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.320
on video!

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.320
Saving it for

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.520
when he's a big shot!

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.680
Watch it!

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.240
Steps here!

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.640
Steps ahead,

00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:04.880
lift your feet!

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:05.760
Careful, that's it!

00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:06.920
Keep going!

00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.280
You OK?

00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.640
He's totally wasted.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.760
So sorry!

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.560
No worries.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.480
Couldn't stop him.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.600
You're kind enough

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.760
to bring him home.

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:16.400
Feel awful.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.080
- C'mon!
- Easy!

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:19.240
- OK.
- Careful!

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.800
Must've been some party

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.400
to get this drunk?

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:28.960
Our investor

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.040
took us to

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:30.680
this dinner thing.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.320
Bunch of

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.560
strangers,

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:34.760
some fund guy,

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:35.600
and

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.160
an investment boss.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.040
Might be

00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.120
future partners.

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.600
I'm singing off-key.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.520
Jesse's turn.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.920
Went singing too?

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.840
No,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.360
some music teacher

00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:49.240
showed up

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.320
mid-dinner.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.080
She did all

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.160
the singing.

00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.120
It's pretty late.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:54.920
I gotta go.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:55.720
Yeah, yeah.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:56.480
Here's the car key.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:58.040
Thank you so much!

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:58.920
You know the exit, right?

00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.400
Yeah,

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.360
call me if you need anything!

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:00.840
OK.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:01.440
Take care of him.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:02.400
Thanks!

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:03.200
No problem.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:13.880
Feel awful,

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.920
really awful.

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.840
I want...

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:21.400
some water

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:24.600
but gotta pee too.

00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:26.960
It's weird.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:29.960
Got me all confused.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.680
If someone

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.320
has to

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:38.440
work...

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.480
Up and at 'em!

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:46.760
Fu Yudong!

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.400
Fu Yudong!

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.960
Time to get up!

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.440
I'm going!

00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.640
Wake up!

00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.360
C'mon!

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.200
Move it!

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.160
One quick move!

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:03.240
3, 2, 1!

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.000
Man, you're heavy!

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:12.800
Hey,

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.680
massage time!

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:14.720
Giving you a massage!

00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:15.840
Missing my

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.360
work hours...

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:20.440
Will you get up?

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:24.640
Fine, I'm gone!

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.520
On your own now!

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.920
No business progress yet,

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:29.240
drinking's coming along great!
