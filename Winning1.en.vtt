2022
SEOUL ASIAD STADIUM

00:00:49.048 --> 00:00:50.508
Go, Korea!

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.971
<i>We're here at Asiad Stadium,</i>
<i>where the final match</i>

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:56.848
<i>of the Asian Rugby Cup is taking place.</i>

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:59.893
<i>For the first time in 12 years,</i>
<i>Team Korea has made it to the finals</i>

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:02.312
<i>and is now hoping to win</i>
<i>the championship against Japan.</i>

00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:06.024
<i>Although we are against Japan,</i>
<i>the best team in Asia,</i>

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:08.485
<i>Team Korea still has a strong chance.</i>
<i>Right?</i>

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.905
<i>Of course. Team Korea has</i>
<i>their star athlete, Ju Ga-ram.</i>

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:15.075
<i>He has scored more than half</i>
<i>of the team's points in this competition</i>

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:16.743
<i>and has shown peak performance.</i>

00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:19.454
<i>I'm sure he will bring us another</i>
<i>outstanding game.</i>

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.676
KNOCK 'EM DEAD
K-RUGBY

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.386
VICTORY FOR KOREA

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.266
WE HAVE THE ONE AND ONLY
JU GA-RAM

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.769
THE PRIDE OF KOREAN RUGBY, JU GA-RAM!

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:46.189
Ju Ga-ram!

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:47.106
EPISODE 1

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.026
<i>And now, Team Korea</i>
<i>is making their entrance.</i>

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.613
<i>Leading the way is Ju Ga-ram, Korea's ace.</i>

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.299
<i>This match decides</i>
<i>the team's Olympic qualification,</i>

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:15.051
so it is a very important game.

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:18.721
Mr. Park, will you explain rugby
for those who are new to it?

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:21.891
You can see a rugby post
and a goal line at each end.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.601
In rugby, you run with the ball,

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:26.437
pass the goal line, and ground the ball
to score a try.

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:29.357
Remember this,
and you'll enjoy rugby even more.

00:02:32.443 --> 00:02:34.154
<i>It's a tense moment.</i>

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:36.698
<i>Team Korea prepares for a kick-off.</i>

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:45.874
<i>And the game kicks off.</i>

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:48.751
<i>It's Korea versus Japan.</i>
<i>Japan versus Korea.</i>

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.837
<i>The final match of the Asian Cup begins.</i>

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:56.259
SECOND HALF
KOREA 30 - 33 JAPAN

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:57.969
<i>Only 57 seconds left.</i>

00:02:58.052 --> 00:03:00.763
<i>Team Korea has enough time</i>
<i>for one last play.</i>

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.390
<i>They need to make it count.</i>

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:08.605
<i>Ju Ga-ram has the ball.</i>

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:10.607
<i>He rushes forward. Run!</i>
<i>Here he goes.</i>

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.735
<i>Ju Ga-ram!</i>

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:15.236
<i>Outstanding!</i>

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.362
<i>He's going for it.</i>

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.406
<i>Ju Ga-ram! He's fast. He outruns them.</i>

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.325
<i>Ju Ga-ram's still going.</i>

00:03:20.408 --> 00:03:21.534
<i>He's about to score.</i>

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:22.660
<i>Finally, Ju Ga-ram…</i>

00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:25.622
<i>Ju Ga-ram did it!</i>

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:28.416
<i>Team Korea wins!</i>

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:29.834
<i>We won!</i>

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:32.295
<i>Ju Ga-ram has done it!</i>

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.131
<i>Hurray for Korea!</i>

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:36.132
<i>They crushed Japan.</i>

00:03:37.592 --> 00:03:39.969
<i>Ju Ga-ram crushed Japan.</i>

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.934
KOREA 35 - 33 JAPAN

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:56.027
<i>During the doping test</i>
<i>after the finals, Ju Ga-ram…</i>

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.488
<i>Ju Ga-ram's doping</i>
<i>has forfeited his gold medal…</i>

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.991
<i>The national rugby player, Ju Ga-ram,</i>
<i>is causing a stir with news</i>

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:05.453
<i>that he used an illegal substance</i>
<i>before the Asian Cup.</i>

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:09.791
<i>Mr. Ju, how do you feel?</i>

00:04:09.874 --> 00:04:11.960
2022 ASIAN RUGBY CUP DOPING INVESTIGATION

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:23.596
I'm going to retire.

THE WINNING TRY

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:33.731
The annual operating budget
for the Rugby Team…

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:34.774
THREE YEARS LATER

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:36.276
…is over 40 million won.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:40.822
And the result of that investment
was 25 losses, no wins, and one draw.

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:45.076
In the end, none of this year's graduates
were accepted into a works team,

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.619
let alone a pro team.

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:48.663
So?

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:52.292
PRINCIPAL KANG JEONG-HYO
FORMER SHOOTING COACH

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:54.877
I'm just saying
we need to be more realistic.

00:04:55.753 --> 00:04:58.464
VICE PRINCIPAL SEONG JONG-MAN
FORMER TRACK AND FIELD COACH

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.174
Is rugby worth the investment?

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:03.469
Shall we evaluate its value?

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:05.722
<i>Kang Tae-pung, a first-year.</i>

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:10.393
Tae-pung.

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:17.066
KANG TAE-PUNG, FIRST-YEAR
POSITION: CENTER

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.901
<i>He is considered talented,</i>

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.403
<i>but he is only a first-year.</i>

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:23.156
<i>Who knows what'll happen next year.</i>

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.073
Darn it.

00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.076
<i>Do Hyeong-sik, a second-year.</i>

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.496
DO HYEONG-SIK, SECOND-YEAR
POSITION: SCRUM HALF

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:32.332
Catch it!

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:38.546
Come on. No ball, no tackle.

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:40.131
I was just passing by.

00:05:41.174 --> 00:05:42.717
I didn't see you down there.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.054
Tiny bastard.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.600
Say that again, motherfucker.

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:52.727
What did you say, you piece of shit?

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:55.480
- Calm down.
- Come here, you fucking bitch.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.857
- He's full of bullshit.
<i>- He has anger issues.</i>

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:02.028
He caused three forfeits
in the first half of this year.

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:03.237
<i>Kim Ju-yang, a second-year.</i>

00:06:04.238 --> 00:06:06.908
<i>He has a physique that's hard to come by</i>
<i>in high school.</i>

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:10.328
KIM JU-YANG, SECOND-YEAR
POSITION: PROP

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:17.001
- Keep your chin up.
- Ju-yang, push.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.386
<i>He is called Crybaby</i>
<i>because he cries about everything.</i>

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.346
Poor thing!

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:33.893
<i>So Myeong-u, a third-year.</i>

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:36.604
Hey, get out of the way.

00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:45.655
SO MYEONG-U, THIRD-YEAR
POSITION: HOOKER

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:48.574
Hey!

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.618
- This is an expensive camera.
- So?

00:06:52.245 --> 00:06:53.287
What if it broke?

00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:55.665
- That was crazy.
<i>- He seems</i>

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:58.209
<i>to be more interested</i>
<i>in something else.</i>

00:06:58.292 --> 00:06:59.377
Look at this.

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:08.594
What? Where's my opponent?

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:13.683
<i>Oh Yeong-gwang, a third-year.</i>

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:17.478
<i>He found his way out on his own.</i>

00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:22.900
- I'm good.
<i>- He's studying to become a civil servant.</i>

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:25.027
OH YEONG-GWANG, THIRD-YEAR
POSITION: FLY-HALF

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.155
<i>Yoon Seong-jun, a third-year.</i>

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.290
HANYANG : DAESANG

FIRST HALF - 00 : 35
SECOND HALF - 00 : 33

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.048
CAPTAIN YOON SEONG-JUN
POSITION: WING

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:47.091
<i>He's pretty good.</i>

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:52.096
<i>But what can he do all by himself?</i>

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:56.893
Sir, rugby is a seven-player sport.

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:59.687
You've only mentioned six.
You have one left.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:01.105
Who did I miss?

00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:02.565
Pyo Seon-ho, a second-year.

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:06.319
<i>As a former judo player,</i>
<i>he's very strong and physical.</i>

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:10.990
Oops, I got busted.

00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:14.911
PYO SEON-HO, SECOND-YEAR
POSITION: PROP

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.206
Wait for me.

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:21.501
He doesn't ring a bell.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.713
They don't even have a coach now.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.509
The second semester is around the corner,
yet we're still missing a coach.

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:32.386
Are you suggesting
getting rid of the Rugby Team?

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.680
That would be more rational.

00:08:34.764 --> 00:08:37.683
For you, it might be.

00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.435
Did the players consent to it?

00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:42.230
Why do we need their consent
at this point?

00:08:42.813 --> 00:08:45.733
We can offer a different path to everyone.

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:49.278
Are there any teams that need an athlete?

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:52.323
Well…

00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:53.699
I don't think so.

00:08:54.742 --> 00:08:56.661
JEON NAK-GYUN
HEAD SHOOTING COACH

00:08:56.744 --> 00:09:00.289
They can't shoot or draw bows now,
can they?

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:02.959
The basic sports teams
will have to take them.

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:05.044
Maybe swimming and weightlifting?

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.339
The Track and Field Team should take them.

00:09:08.422 --> 00:09:12.468
What? Do you think
we're a recycling center for trash?

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:13.719
No thank you.

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:17.348
Even if someone were to take them,
they'd only cause trouble and headaches.

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:19.600
BANG HEUNG-NAM,
AEROBICS COACH

00:09:19.684 --> 00:09:22.270
We can just give basic job training
to the third-years.

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:25.064
Why don't we transfer the rest
to another school?

00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:26.190
That could work.

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:30.987
What's there to think about?
They don't even have a coach.

00:09:32.196 --> 00:09:33.990
Where is your coach?

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:36.659
<i>He's on sick leave.</i>

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:38.411
KIM MIN-JUNG, FORMER RUGBY COACH

00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:41.789
This is a practice game,
so we can manage without our coach.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.042
How can you play without a coach?

00:09:45.126 --> 00:09:48.838
Who will be responsible
if there's an accident? I can't do this.

00:09:48.921 --> 00:09:50.172
- Everyone, go back.
- Sir.

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.384
We got our school's permission.

00:09:53.467 --> 00:09:54.969
I don't care. Get your coach.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.805
Where is Coach Kim Min-jung?

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.099
Probably in the hospital.

00:10:00.182 --> 00:10:01.726
You should have brought a substitute!

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:08.149
How are you going to train them
without a coach next semester?

00:10:08.232 --> 00:10:11.152
Are you going to do it yourself?

00:10:17.158 --> 00:10:18.117
We do…

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.203
have a coach.

00:10:29.003 --> 00:10:31.505
THE 63RD NATIONAL FENCING CHAMPIONSHIP

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:41.724
HANYANG PHYSICAL EDUCATION HIGH SCHOOL

00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:48.230
Hey.

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:51.275
No outsiders.

00:10:51.942 --> 00:10:54.862
I've come here today
as a coach for the rugby…

00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:57.907
It's you! The judo player!

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.659
What was your name again?

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:01.535
Right! Lee Chang-yong.

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:03.037
Hey, don't you remember me?

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.455
I'm Ju Ga-ram, the rugby player.

00:11:04.538 --> 00:11:05.790
It's nice to see you again.

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:09.543
If you're a visitor,
tell me who you're here to see.

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:12.171
I need to confirm with them
before I let you through.

00:11:12.254 --> 00:11:14.090
Come on. We're friends.

00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:18.052
I'll call the police if you keep this up.

00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:19.970
Call the police, then.

00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:22.890
Call them.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:40.783
Chang-yong!

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.623
Excuse me!

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:49.959
Coming through.

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:05.307
Hey! Stop!

00:12:06.183 --> 00:12:07.351
Stop right there, you!

00:12:10.062 --> 00:12:11.480
Excuse me!

00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:37.465
Darn it. Where'd he go?

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:40.509
- Ju Ga-ram!
- Hey!

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.678
You do know my name.

00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:44.930
Man, I'll get you for this.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:47.766
It's good to see you again, my friend!

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:49.185
<i>What do you mean?</i>

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:51.854
There wasn't a single applicant
by yesterday's deadline.

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:52.771
Who is it?

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:55.983
I'm here.

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:03.491
Say hello to Coach Ju Ga-ram.

00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:05.451
- You're…
- Hello.

00:13:05.534 --> 00:13:06.994
- Hey, Heung-nam.
- Ju Ga-ram?

00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:11.332
Choking was my specialty, jerk.

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:13.292
Chang-yong, hey. Ma'am, help.

00:13:14.251 --> 00:13:15.211
Anyone?

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.005
Come here, you jerk.

00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:22.968
Is that who I think it is?

00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:24.720
Yes, you're right.

00:13:24.803 --> 00:13:28.557
The proud alumnus of this school
and the idol of Korean rugby…

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:30.392
How ridiculous.

00:13:32.353 --> 00:13:33.479
Come on.

00:13:34.104 --> 00:13:37.983
How can we hire someone
with a doping scandal? He's a disgrace!

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:40.528
Exactly. He was even expelled
from the union.

00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:42.905
He was expelled as an athlete.

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:45.366
He's still qualified to be a coach.

00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:47.952
He is certified.
There are no legal issues.

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:51.121
Being legal doesn't mean it's okay.

00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:54.083
Anyway, I can't agree to this.

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:58.087
You know,

00:13:58.587 --> 00:14:02.716
I don't need your agreement.

00:14:17.815 --> 00:14:19.358
Right, I should get that.

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:23.737
This is the teachers' room.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:26.699
Pardon?

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:28.534
What is it?!

00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:31.120
It's the rugby stadium.

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:38.085
Let's hurry up and go.

00:14:41.755 --> 00:14:42.673
Sir.

00:14:42.756 --> 00:14:44.341
The coach is… I mean

00:14:44.425 --> 00:14:46.385
an instructor is on their way.

00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:48.721
Can you wait a little longer?

00:14:49.471 --> 00:14:53.767
It's been over an hour since we warmed up.
How much more do we have to wait?

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:55.895
Go.

00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:57.062
Why don't we start first--

00:14:57.146 --> 00:14:59.607
No coach, no match. Go away.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.233
Let's start the match!

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:17.958
Hanyang.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:22.755
Look who's here.

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:25.007
He looks familiar.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:27.426
- Who's that?
- What about Coach Kim?

00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:28.594
I don't know.

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:31.221
Ju Ga-ram…

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.950
Nice to meet you.

00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:57.081
A new coach?

00:15:57.748 --> 00:15:58.958
What about Coach Kim?

00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:02.795
Mr. Kim went to coach
Daesang High School's rugby team.

00:16:02.878 --> 00:16:04.254
Say hello.

00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:06.924
Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Ju Ga-ram.

00:16:10.844 --> 00:16:11.762
Hey, Captain.

00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:14.556
Nice to meet you.

00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:22.606
Are you <i>that</i> Ju Ga-ram?

00:16:26.193 --> 00:16:27.403
Yes, that's me.

00:16:28.153 --> 00:16:30.364
The six-time Player of the Year.

00:16:30.447 --> 00:16:32.658
The MVP of the Asian Rugby Cup.

00:16:32.741 --> 00:16:34.284
The Asian Games medalist.

00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:36.036
I'm a man of many titles.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.330
What about "a juicer who got expelled"?

00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:45.921
That's a famous one too.

00:16:53.971 --> 00:16:56.640
No back-up players?
You all have to play full-time.

00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:57.683
Anyone sick today?

00:16:59.351 --> 00:17:01.395
Okay. And no one is injured.

00:17:01.478 --> 00:17:03.689
Let's see how we work as a team.

00:17:03.772 --> 00:17:04.815
What are you doing?

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:09.945
You said you wanted to play.

00:17:11.155 --> 00:17:13.282
You called,
saying you need a coach to play.

00:17:14.825 --> 00:17:15.659
So here I am.

00:17:20.414 --> 00:17:23.292
The coach is here. How much longer
do we have to wait for you guys?

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:24.835
Right. We're ready.

00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:31.216
Okay. Is the chant still the same?
Shall we, then?

00:17:32.009 --> 00:17:32.843
Get ready.

00:17:33.886 --> 00:17:34.720
Go!

00:17:34.803 --> 00:17:37.431
- Hanyang!
- Hanyang!

00:17:41.351 --> 00:17:44.938
We'll accept the disqualification
for not having a coach. I'm sorry.

00:17:52.946 --> 00:17:54.531
Thank you.

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:18.806
HANYANG RUGBY

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.538
HANYANG'S ACE
JU GA-RAM

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.935
TEAMMATES ALWAYS STAND BY YOU

00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:10.524
HANYANG RUGBY TEAM

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:24.830
Gosh, I should throw this away.

00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:28.333
That won't solve the problem.

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.836
The kids hate me so much.

00:19:30.919 --> 00:19:32.546
You deserve it, though.

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:36.300
Then why did you ask me to come?

00:19:37.384 --> 00:19:39.094
Did you see how they treated me?

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:40.679
Back in the day,

00:19:40.762 --> 00:19:45.017
the coach's words were the law,
religion, and revelation.

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:52.983
Ga-ram, what's going on?

00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:55.485
Doctor, what happened?

00:19:56.612 --> 00:19:58.488
He has severe Myasthenia Gravis.

00:19:59.031 --> 00:20:03.368
The last check-up showed
reduced mobility in his arms and legs.

00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:05.454
This time, his respiratory system
is paralyzed.

00:20:09.124 --> 00:20:11.877
That only applies to a normal coach.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.378
To them,

00:20:13.462 --> 00:20:15.631
you're just a juicer and a retired player.

00:20:15.714 --> 00:20:16.882
You're so harsh.

00:20:20.177 --> 00:20:21.553
Accept the truth.

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:24.556
But don't get discouraged yet.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.226
You still have miles to go.

00:20:27.809 --> 00:20:29.019
What if I get shot?

00:20:43.492 --> 00:20:44.993
BAE I-JI
SHOOTING PLAYER-COACH

00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:47.329
POINT: 9.8

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:52.376
Nice shot, Coach Bae.

00:20:53.293 --> 00:20:55.170
Go easy or you'll hurt your shoulder.

00:20:56.004 --> 00:20:56.880
I'm done.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.968
Isn't it restocking day
for the nurse's office?

00:21:02.052 --> 00:21:03.470
I've organized them already.

00:21:05.555 --> 00:21:06.890
Do you want some?

00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:08.350
YANG SEUNG-HUI
SCHOOL NURSE

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:11.019
The tryouts are less than a month away,
so I'm on a diet.

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:12.729
- I-ji.
- I know.

00:21:13.438 --> 00:21:15.941
Being an athlete at my age
is selfish of me.

00:21:17.067 --> 00:21:19.278
But what can I do?
I just can't seem to let go.

00:21:19.361 --> 00:21:22.281
Do you also have a hard time
getting over people?

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:25.659
You know, like from your past,
like an ex-boyfriend?

00:21:25.742 --> 00:21:27.995
What was his name again?

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:31.999
You broke up with Ga-ram long ago.

00:21:32.082 --> 00:21:35.919
If you beat the odds and run into him--

00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:37.045
I'll kill him.

00:21:37.754 --> 00:21:38.797
I see.

00:21:40.799 --> 00:21:41.925
I mean it.

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:44.553
I will kill him.

00:21:55.355 --> 00:21:58.358
Outsiders aren't allowed
in the Shooting Team's room.

00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:15.792
Ju Ga-ram?

00:22:17.627 --> 00:22:19.212
I guess I'm an outsider.

00:22:19.296 --> 00:22:20.505
I saw that the lights were on.

00:22:20.589 --> 00:22:22.382
Just as I expected, you were here.

00:22:22.966 --> 00:22:25.927
You're the only player
who'd practice this late.

00:22:26.011 --> 00:22:27.471
So how's the training going?

00:22:28.555 --> 00:22:31.850
Did you shoot a lot?

00:22:31.933 --> 00:22:34.144
Oh, Lord. I said I wanted to run into him

00:22:34.227 --> 00:22:36.855
when I had a gun in my hand.

00:22:36.938 --> 00:22:38.732
Is this the best you could do?

00:22:43.195 --> 00:22:47.074
If you pray like that,
even God would get scared.

00:22:51.787 --> 00:22:52.996
Crap.

00:22:54.956 --> 00:22:57.459
The Shooting Team has become much fancier.

00:22:57.542 --> 00:23:00.087
Our Rugby Team looks
just like it did 20 years ago.

00:23:02.339 --> 00:23:04.091
You even have electronic targets.

00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:05.550
More firing points too.

00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:06.551
ARMORY

00:23:06.635 --> 00:23:07.552
How cool.

00:23:08.637 --> 00:23:10.597
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

00:23:18.647 --> 00:23:20.565
The national tryouts are in 30 days.

00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:24.361
So you're a player-coach now
who trains alone at night.

00:23:25.403 --> 00:23:28.031
Right. It'd be awkward to train
with your students.

00:23:29.324 --> 00:23:32.828
You're still an active player,
and now you're even coaching.

00:23:56.017 --> 00:23:56.852
You bastard.

00:23:56.935 --> 00:23:59.729
Aren't shooters forbidden
from pointing a gun at people?

00:23:59.813 --> 00:24:01.148
You're no human, you asshole.

00:24:01.231 --> 00:24:03.358
Come on. Don't curse at me.

00:24:06.111 --> 00:24:08.530
That's your fake gun
for practicing your posture.

00:24:08.613 --> 00:24:11.491
Right? I've been the boyfriend
of a shooter for years.

00:24:11.575 --> 00:24:15.287
I can tell a real one from a fake one.

00:24:15.370 --> 00:24:18.081
You're not my boyfriend,
you're my ex, jerk!

00:24:18.165 --> 00:24:20.834
You ghosted me for three years
without a single word.

00:24:20.917 --> 00:24:23.086
What? "How have you been?" Really?

00:24:26.339 --> 00:24:30.510
Technically, since I didn't ask
to break up,

00:24:30.594 --> 00:24:32.262
aren't I still your boyfriend?

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:37.934
Even if it gets me expelled
from the association,

00:24:38.602 --> 00:24:39.728
I will kill you.

00:24:44.482 --> 00:24:45.567
I-ji.

00:24:47.652 --> 00:24:48.778
It's been a while.

00:24:55.202 --> 00:24:56.453
I'm not running away.

00:24:56.536 --> 00:24:58.872
With the tryouts coming up soon,

00:24:58.955 --> 00:25:01.082
I'm helping you avoid getting expelled.

00:25:06.713 --> 00:25:08.298
TEACHER
SHOOTING COACH, BAE I-JI

00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:11.843
That asshole, that crazy bastard!

00:25:12.928 --> 00:25:15.263
Who? Are you talking to me?

00:25:19.017 --> 00:25:20.185
Sir.

00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:24.356
What's with all the BBs?

00:25:24.439 --> 00:25:27.776
I allowed you to train alone.
Can you keep it low-key?

00:25:28.443 --> 00:25:29.653
Sorry.

00:25:29.736 --> 00:25:32.030
Geez, I-ji.

00:25:32.113 --> 00:25:33.281
Gosh.

00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:36.534
I'm telling you, you should retire
before you humiliate yourself even more.

00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:39.246
Frankly, you can't even shoot
as well as U-jin.

00:25:39.329 --> 00:25:41.706
Would holding onto it longer

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:42.791
make any…

00:25:43.458 --> 00:25:44.292
No, never mind.

00:25:44.376 --> 00:25:47.587
Since the armory's open,
go clean U-jin's and Seol-hyeon's guns.

00:25:47.671 --> 00:25:49.130
The rule is that everyone

00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:51.883
cleans their own gun.

00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:53.969
They don't have time for that.

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:57.472
If you lack coaching skills,
this is the least you can do.

00:25:57.555 --> 00:25:59.683
That's what being a coach means.

00:26:00.183 --> 00:26:03.436
Anyway, a professor
from Daehan Sport University is coming by.

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.398
I'm off to have a drink.
Come and drive me home later.

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:08.275
I'll call you.

00:26:09.859 --> 00:26:11.236
Geez.

00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:38.096
A man should endure it.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.515
Geez, that hurts.

00:26:51.651 --> 00:26:53.695
ROOM 304

00:26:54.571 --> 00:26:56.281
- What is it?
- Hyeong-sik.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:03.788
Seong-jun.

00:27:03.872 --> 00:27:05.457
Can you try calling Coach Kim?

00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:08.001
I already did.

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:12.005
- What did he say?
- He didn't pick up.

00:27:12.088 --> 00:27:12.922
Darn it.

00:27:13.006 --> 00:27:15.550
I had planned so much content
to shoot with him.

00:27:16.134 --> 00:27:17.427
I have to replan…

00:27:18.178 --> 00:27:20.805
Wait. "Ju Ga-ram returns as a coach."

00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:22.599
That's bitching clickbait.

00:27:22.682 --> 00:27:25.435
- Two million views? Ten million?
- Seriously?

00:27:28.563 --> 00:27:30.065
Why do you always yell at me?

00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:32.692
He's just lashing out at you
because his life is falling apart.

00:27:33.443 --> 00:27:35.362
Hey, watch your mouth. Seriously.

00:27:35.945 --> 00:27:38.531
- What, are you going to hit me?
- Here they go again.

00:27:39.407 --> 00:27:43.078
Just because we don't have Coach Kim
doesn't mean our lives are over.

00:27:43.161 --> 00:27:46.164
- Right?
- Because Ju Ga-ram was expelled,

00:27:46.247 --> 00:27:49.918
he can't write recommendation letters
or promote us to the pro teams.

00:27:50.001 --> 00:27:50.919
Really?

00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:52.045
Then what happens to us?

00:27:52.128 --> 00:27:54.506
What do you think?
It's every man for himself.

00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:57.592
Captain, what do we do now?

00:28:01.638 --> 00:28:02.889
Go and gather the others.

00:28:04.808 --> 00:28:05.725
Hurry.

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:12.607
Yeah, go lead the way.

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:13.775
Hurry up.

00:28:13.858 --> 00:28:15.652
Hello. Good morning.

00:28:15.735 --> 00:28:16.653
Hello.

00:28:16.736 --> 00:28:18.863
Hello.

00:28:18.947 --> 00:28:19.948
Is everyone here?

00:28:20.031 --> 00:28:21.032
SHOOTING, ARCHERY

00:28:21.116 --> 00:28:22.951
Stand in a straight line.

00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:25.120
RUGBY

00:28:27.163 --> 00:28:28.665
Hey, U-jin is here too.

00:28:28.748 --> 00:28:29.624
You should say hello.

00:28:30.208 --> 00:28:31.626
Shut up, will you?

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.128
Did you have <i>ramyeon?</i>

00:28:34.671 --> 00:28:36.798
You should cut back. You look bloated.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.095
SEO U-JIN
SHOOTING TEAM'S CAPTAIN

00:28:48.143 --> 00:28:49.352
NA SEOL-HYEON
SCHOOL PRESIDENT

00:28:49.436 --> 00:28:50.520
Good morning.

00:28:50.603 --> 00:28:51.730
DREAM BIG AT HANYANG HIGH

00:28:52.272 --> 00:28:54.107
- Good morning, sir.
- Hello.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.194
That was boiling hot.

00:28:59.404 --> 00:29:01.197
The alcohol is finally wearing off.

00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:04.826
I heard you met with someone
from Daehan Sport University.

00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:06.745
Did you ask him to look over our…

00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:08.621
Hey, Heung-nam.

00:29:08.705 --> 00:29:10.582
I'm not the one asking favors.

00:29:10.665 --> 00:29:13.001
"Please send us some good players."

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:15.086
- That's what he said.
- I knew it.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.589
Can you put in a good word
for our Aerobics Team…

00:29:19.799 --> 00:29:21.217
Got more? Get me another.

00:29:22.343 --> 00:29:24.053
Another one? Okay.

00:29:24.137 --> 00:29:25.805
Hello.

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.141
Hi.

00:29:28.725 --> 00:29:29.893
- Hello.
- Never mind.

00:29:29.976 --> 00:29:31.269
- I'll have that.
- Hello.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:36.441
This is mine.

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:38.234
I'll have it.

00:29:40.945 --> 00:29:41.946
Hey, Ga-ram.

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.573
Sir, what's going on?

00:29:43.656 --> 00:29:44.532
Hold on.

00:29:58.713 --> 00:29:59.923
Have it, then.

00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:02.467
- Goodness.
- That's hot.

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:11.684
Shooting Team, call in.

00:30:11.768 --> 00:30:13.603
Everyone is here.

00:30:13.686 --> 00:30:15.146
Shooting Team, go.

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.856
Shooting always gets to go first

00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.399
because they're performing well.

00:30:18.483 --> 00:30:20.068
When will we ever go first?

00:30:20.151 --> 00:30:22.111
Archery Team, get going.

00:30:22.195 --> 00:30:23.363
Wrestling Team, go.

00:30:23.905 --> 00:30:26.407
- Fencers, what are you doing?
- Gymnastics Team, go.

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:27.742
Rowing Team, get going.

00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:30.036
- Weightlifting Team, go.
- Boxing Team, move.

00:30:30.119 --> 00:30:31.663
Taekwondo Team, go.

00:30:31.746 --> 00:30:33.665
Okay, our Rugby Team…

00:30:35.333 --> 00:30:36.417
Geez.

00:30:37.252 --> 00:30:39.838
Gosh. That was hilarious.

00:30:41.256 --> 00:30:42.924
I've never seen that happen before.

00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:46.386
They completely ignored him.

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:52.016
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:53.810
- Let's go.
- Go.

00:30:53.893 --> 00:30:56.020
- Let's do it.
- Go.

00:30:58.690 --> 00:30:59.858
Let's go.

00:30:59.941 --> 00:31:00.900
We're almost there.

00:31:05.071 --> 00:31:06.781
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

00:31:06.865 --> 00:31:08.324
- Hello, sir.
- It's hot, isn't it?

00:31:08.408 --> 00:31:09.325
Have this.

00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:11.119
Really? May I? Thank you.

00:31:11.202 --> 00:31:12.036
RUGBY TEAM

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.371
Where's the Rugby Team?

00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:20.003
What did you do
to make them disappear on the first day?

00:31:20.086 --> 00:31:22.547
If they cause trouble,
who's going to take responsibility?

00:31:26.509 --> 00:31:28.052
Have you tried calling the captain?

00:31:28.636 --> 00:31:29.762
I don't have…

00:31:30.763 --> 00:31:31.598
his number.

00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:33.766
For goodness' sake.

00:31:34.601 --> 00:31:37.312
I think I know where they are.

00:31:37.979 --> 00:31:40.356
What are you waiting for? Go and get them.

00:31:44.444 --> 00:31:45.695
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

00:31:46.279 --> 00:31:48.031
Why are Hanyang students here at Daesang?

00:31:48.865 --> 00:31:50.867
Are you thugs? Are you here to fight?

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:52.493
No, actually…

00:31:52.577 --> 00:31:54.245
We're here to see the coach.

00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:55.496
Why do you want to see him?

00:31:56.164 --> 00:31:57.165
- Because…
- A car's coming.

00:31:57.248 --> 00:31:58.875
Come here. Come on.

00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:04.380
- Coach.
- Coach.

00:32:04.464 --> 00:32:07.300
- What are you doing here?
- What happened?

00:32:07.842 --> 00:32:09.135
Why are you at Daesang?

00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:12.805
It is what it is.

00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:14.557
Did the school…

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:17.060
put pressure on you to quit?

00:32:18.728 --> 00:32:19.896
Hey, Seong-jun.

00:32:19.979 --> 00:32:22.273
You guys couldn't even win once last year.

00:32:22.357 --> 00:32:25.026
I left because I didn't want you
to drag me down.

00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:28.696
I escaped before you could
ruin my coaching career.

00:32:30.615 --> 00:32:31.658
No.

00:32:31.741 --> 00:32:35.286
You said Tae-pung would get better
in the second half.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:38.414
You said we're bound to improve
with a team like this.

00:32:38.498 --> 00:32:40.917
Right. Tae-pung is all right.

00:32:41.501 --> 00:32:44.337
And you, too. But just two players,
with no bench members?

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:47.382
Aren't you the coach?
You should have raised us to--

00:32:47.465 --> 00:32:50.093
Raise you? Do you think I'm your parent?

00:32:51.427 --> 00:32:53.471
A coach uses his players to get results.

00:32:53.554 --> 00:32:56.724
I get incentives for that.
That's what I get paid to do.

00:32:57.392 --> 00:33:00.311
What do you think a coach is?

00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:01.270
Huh?

00:33:02.188 --> 00:33:04.315
Tell me.

00:33:06.901 --> 00:33:08.069
Woof!

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:09.404
Woof, woof.

00:33:09.946 --> 00:33:11.280
Woof.

00:33:11.364 --> 00:33:12.323
Woof, woof.

00:33:12.407 --> 00:33:13.324
Woof.

00:33:14.075 --> 00:33:15.243
Woof, woof.

00:33:16.285 --> 00:33:17.286
Woof, woof!

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:19.038
- It was you.
- What are you doing?

00:33:19.122 --> 00:33:22.959
How could you speak so cruelly
to a bunch of 18-year-olds?

00:33:24.961 --> 00:33:25.920
Look who it is.

00:33:26.004 --> 00:33:28.423
Are you the new coach?

00:33:29.424 --> 00:33:32.051
I was wondering who'd clean up this mess.

00:33:32.135 --> 00:33:34.178
You're the perfect fit.

00:33:35.888 --> 00:33:39.183
The dogs in this neighborhood
bark so loud, they almost sound human.

00:33:40.101 --> 00:33:42.854
- Are you talking about me?
- Enough is enough.

00:33:43.855 --> 00:33:47.316
I don't have time for your gibberish.

00:33:55.408 --> 00:33:56.242
Let's go.

00:34:00.204 --> 00:34:01.664
Geez.

00:34:02.915 --> 00:34:05.418
For goodness' sake.

00:34:22.101 --> 00:34:23.311
Geez.

00:34:30.610 --> 00:34:31.569
What are you doing?

00:34:31.652 --> 00:34:32.862
Wash your ears.

00:34:32.945 --> 00:34:34.530
Get that crap out of your ears.

00:34:35.406 --> 00:34:36.657
Why are you crying?

00:34:37.158 --> 00:34:38.201
Thank you.

00:34:38.868 --> 00:34:40.161
I will wash them myself.

00:34:40.244 --> 00:34:41.704
I can do it myself.

00:34:45.792 --> 00:34:47.627
- Did you know all along?
- I did.

00:34:47.710 --> 00:34:49.545
Did you come here
to watch us get humiliated?

00:34:50.213 --> 00:34:53.091
Hey, what's with you? He helped us.

00:34:53.925 --> 00:34:56.469
No, I didn't come to help you.

00:34:57.053 --> 00:34:57.887
Geez.

00:34:58.471 --> 00:35:00.765
The whole Rugby Team is getting punished.

00:35:00.848 --> 00:35:03.726
I came to get you
because I was scared to go alone.

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:05.269
Punished?

00:35:07.647 --> 00:35:08.689
Gosh.

00:35:12.068 --> 00:35:14.237
Hey, stop moving.

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.239
You'll spill it.

00:35:17.198 --> 00:35:18.950
Your underpants will get wet.

00:35:19.659 --> 00:35:22.411
If you spill it, you'll drop
into the thinking man position.

00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:25.248
Seriously.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.961
Why did you have to go out
and cause trouble?

00:35:30.044 --> 00:35:32.713
Did you think Min-jung would welcome you?

00:35:32.797 --> 00:35:35.424
Geez, look at you. Do you have a problem?

00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:39.053
- No, I don't.
- I can't hear you.

00:35:40.263 --> 00:35:42.056
Everyone, take one hand off.

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.474
- What…
- Do it!

00:35:43.558 --> 00:35:45.017
Come on.

00:35:54.694 --> 00:35:55.945
Geez.

00:35:56.028 --> 00:35:57.113
Hey.

00:35:57.196 --> 00:35:58.406
You can't take this?

00:35:59.448 --> 00:36:01.701
That's why your coach quit.

00:36:02.451 --> 00:36:05.580
You don't even train yourself
when you're the captain.

00:36:08.291 --> 00:36:09.500
You're rugby players.

00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:13.087
To pass the ball
and handle physical contact,

00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:14.755
you need strong shoulders.

00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:16.841
That's so distracting.

00:36:18.676 --> 00:36:22.054
I'm glad you have him as a coach.

00:36:22.138 --> 00:36:24.724
You guys are like peas in a pod.

00:36:25.391 --> 00:36:27.143
You all are truly something else.

00:36:37.361 --> 00:36:39.363
CR

00:36:39.447 --> 00:36:40.489
AP

00:37:01.135 --> 00:37:01.969
Sorry, I'm late.

00:37:04.347 --> 00:37:05.264
CRAP

00:37:05.348 --> 00:37:06.557
What are you doing?

00:37:06.641 --> 00:37:07.558
Sorry.

00:37:07.642 --> 00:37:08.726
It's a typo.

00:37:08.809 --> 00:37:10.269
It's supposed to be "apology."

00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:12.897
CRAPOLOGY

00:37:27.536 --> 00:37:30.289
COMMUNITY SERVICE

00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:43.886
I heard you were found at Daesang.

00:37:48.057 --> 00:37:49.225
Yes.

00:37:50.351 --> 00:37:52.061
You must have met with Coach Kim.

00:37:57.566 --> 00:38:01.237
It's not a bad thing
to see things through to the end.

00:38:02.989 --> 00:38:04.282
Good job.

00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:13.124
COUNSELING OFFICE

00:38:13.207 --> 00:38:14.542
Ju Ga-ram, that dude.

00:38:14.625 --> 00:38:16.544
He caused trouble on his first day.

00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:19.964
Don't we have to come up with a plan?

00:38:20.047 --> 00:38:22.091
We need to disband the Rugby Team soon.

00:38:22.174 --> 00:38:25.136
We need their budget
in the second half of the year

00:38:25.803 --> 00:38:28.139
to replace all the targets
to electronic ones.

00:38:28.222 --> 00:38:33.477
The second semester must be fruitful
for you to get promoted to Principal

00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:35.604
- without a problem.
- That's true.

00:38:37.398 --> 00:38:39.817
Did you try talking
to the principal again?

00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:43.195
She's not someone
you can talk some sense into.

00:38:43.279 --> 00:38:45.281
What are you going to do, then?

00:38:45.865 --> 00:38:48.951
If talking doesn't work,
I might have to threaten her.

00:38:58.294 --> 00:39:00.338
<i>Go ahead, Mr. Na.</i>

00:39:01.088 --> 00:39:03.549
I heard the guy who brought shame
to our country

00:39:03.632 --> 00:39:05.551
because of doping is our rugby coach.

00:39:05.634 --> 00:39:06.469
Is that true?

00:39:07.136 --> 00:39:09.472
NA GYU-WON, DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT
OF EDUCATION, HEAD OF PTA

00:39:09.555 --> 00:39:11.515
It was for the Rugby Team's sake.

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:12.892
Exactly.

00:39:12.975 --> 00:39:15.478
Do we really need the Rugby Team?

00:39:15.561 --> 00:39:17.813
As long as we have students on the team.

00:39:17.897 --> 00:39:19.273
No.

00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:22.735
They are athletes training
with funds provided by the school.

00:39:22.818 --> 00:39:25.571
If they received the funds,
they should deliver results.

00:39:25.654 --> 00:39:28.407
This is an elite
physical education high school.

00:39:28.491 --> 00:39:30.451
Nevertheless, a school is still a school.

00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:33.704
A school doesn't expel students
for not getting good grades.

00:39:42.129 --> 00:39:43.297
You're very idealistic.

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:46.926
I heard the new coach was your student.

00:39:47.009 --> 00:39:49.220
- So?
- I hear it could be illegal recruitment.

00:39:49.303 --> 00:39:50.971
That's nonsense.

00:39:51.055 --> 00:39:52.848
He went through the proper process.

00:39:52.932 --> 00:39:54.809
Will others believe that?

00:39:57.353 --> 00:39:58.938
This is what the parents want.

00:40:00.981 --> 00:40:02.566
PETITION FOR COACH DISMISSAL

00:40:05.903 --> 00:40:08.114
REASON FOR DISMISSAL
HISTORY OF DOPING…

00:40:08.197 --> 00:40:10.324
You have six months left until retirement.

00:40:12.493 --> 00:40:14.328
You should retire…

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:17.289
without any complications

00:40:17.957 --> 00:40:19.500
to get your pension.

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:37.435
PETITION FOR COACH DISMISSAL

00:40:38.185 --> 00:40:39.645
Hello.

00:40:42.481 --> 00:40:44.483
Deputy Superintendent of Education, sir.

00:40:46.152 --> 00:40:48.863
- I'm here as Seol-hyeon's dad today.
- I see.

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:49.947
Seol-hyeon.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:51.240
Dad!

00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:55.661
- Are you doing okay?
- Of course.

00:40:55.744 --> 00:40:58.330
I still have some training to do,

00:40:59.248 --> 00:41:00.708
but everyone left.

00:41:00.791 --> 00:41:03.669
Having someone by my side
would make it feel more real.

00:41:07.381 --> 00:41:09.675
Can't U-jin do extra training?

00:41:10.426 --> 00:41:12.470
She completed her training for today.

00:41:14.013 --> 00:41:15.055
So she can't?

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:21.020
Hey, U-jin.

00:41:21.103 --> 00:41:23.898
- Shoot 100 more today.
- I've already shot 200 times.

00:41:23.981 --> 00:41:25.149
I know.

00:41:25.774 --> 00:41:27.735
But shoot 100 more times. Okay?

00:41:27.818 --> 00:41:29.737
As your coach, I think it'll benefit you.

00:41:38.704 --> 00:41:39.747
Okay.

00:41:41.582 --> 00:41:43.709
Tell me if you need anything, my girl.

00:41:43.792 --> 00:41:44.877
I'll make it happen.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:45.920
Thank you, Dad.

00:41:48.172 --> 00:41:49.048
Have a seat here.

00:41:52.426 --> 00:41:53.260
No, thank you.

00:41:54.261 --> 00:41:57.806
Is the training schedule
for the second half of the year out yet?

00:41:58.349 --> 00:42:03.020
We are preparing a training schedule
tailored just for Na-hyeon.

00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:05.648
- Right, Coach Jeon?
- Yes, of course.

00:42:06.607 --> 00:42:09.068
I trust you, Vice Principal Seong.

00:42:09.151 --> 00:42:11.737
Wait, no. Now,

00:42:12.488 --> 00:42:15.491
should I call you Principal Seong?

00:42:20.246 --> 00:42:23.040
<i>A meeting will be held to discuss</i>
<i>the schedule for the common space.</i>

00:42:23.123 --> 00:42:27.461
<i>Captains and coaches of each team,</i>
<i>please gather in the teachers' room.</i>

00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:35.886
Hello.

00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:39.056
Is this how it works?

00:42:45.521 --> 00:42:46.855
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

00:42:48.315 --> 00:42:50.150
- We're all here, so let's get started.
- Okay.

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:52.903
As all of you know,

00:42:52.987 --> 00:42:55.406
we have many teams, but limited space.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:59.868
Let's be considerate
to ensure that promising medalists

00:42:59.952 --> 00:43:01.745
- can train without any issues.
- Yes.

00:43:01.829 --> 00:43:02.705
Yes.

00:43:02.788 --> 00:43:05.291
Let's take turns sharing
your preferred time slot.

00:43:06.166 --> 00:43:09.169
The Track and Field Team will use
the field all day.

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:11.463
What?

00:43:13.591 --> 00:43:14.592
FIELD
TRACK AND FIELD

00:43:14.675 --> 00:43:16.260
Do we have a separate training field?

00:43:16.343 --> 00:43:18.971
If they use the field all day,
where can we train?

00:43:21.974 --> 00:43:23.142
Excuse me.

00:43:23.726 --> 00:43:25.603
The Rugby Team needs the field too.

00:43:25.686 --> 00:43:27.813
Please wait for your turn.

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:30.274
Next team?

00:43:30.858 --> 00:43:34.069
The Wrestling Team will use the gym
four times a week in the afternoon.

00:43:34.153 --> 00:43:37.615
The Fencing Team will use
the multi-purpose stadium at dawn.

00:43:37.698 --> 00:43:40.701
The Aerobics Team will use the auditorium
three times a week.

00:43:40.784 --> 00:43:43.203
Right. How about the Shooting Team?

00:43:44.413 --> 00:43:47.166
We want to use the gym
from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. on weekdays.

00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:49.501
The gym and…

00:43:49.585 --> 00:43:50.419
NIGHT, SHOOTING TEAM

00:43:51.879 --> 00:43:53.005
Sir.

00:43:53.505 --> 00:43:56.133
Our team needs to use the gym
at least twice a week.

00:43:56.216 --> 00:43:59.970
It's unfair for the Shooting Team
to use it five times a week.

00:44:01.221 --> 00:44:04.558
We have many national tournaments
starting this September.

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:07.311
- We need a lot of balance training.
- Yes.

00:44:07.394 --> 00:44:09.438
The Shooting Team has many tournaments
coming up…

00:44:09.521 --> 00:44:11.857
- Yes.
- …with a great chance of winning medals.

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.234
Most importantly, the gym was built
with a lot of help

00:44:14.318 --> 00:44:16.278
from Mr. Na, Seol-hyeon's father.

00:44:16.362 --> 00:44:20.032
He is also the
Deputy Superintendent of Education.

00:44:21.867 --> 00:44:24.203
The Rugby Team
doesn't have any tournaments coming up

00:44:24.286 --> 00:44:26.205
and hasn't contributed much to the school.

00:44:26.288 --> 00:44:28.332
So, let's give it to the Shooting Team.

00:44:28.415 --> 00:44:30.125
- Next team?
- Vice Principal!

00:44:31.126 --> 00:44:33.128
You should get a pair of glasses.

00:44:33.212 --> 00:44:35.255
Wait, is it because you're getting old?

00:44:35.923 --> 00:44:37.007
I'm a big guy,

00:44:37.091 --> 00:44:39.968
but somehow you missed me
when I was waving my hand.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.304
What is it?

00:44:43.889 --> 00:44:45.349
Sit. I'll do the talking.

00:44:47.226 --> 00:44:49.061
Isn't this a
physical education high school?

00:44:49.144 --> 00:44:51.855
In that case,
training is considered part of the class.

00:44:51.939 --> 00:44:55.359
If we give up training,
doesn't that mean no class?

00:44:56.527 --> 00:45:00.989
We want to help our elite athletes
improve,

00:45:01.073 --> 00:45:03.826
not just do charity
for those who are falling behind.

00:45:03.909 --> 00:45:05.202
Also,

00:45:05.285 --> 00:45:06.453
you don't have a say

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:08.288
- right now.
- Why not?

00:45:08.372 --> 00:45:12.835
The PTA requested
a petition to dismiss you.

00:45:12.918 --> 00:45:14.962
Until the voting happens,

00:45:15.045 --> 00:45:19.174
you are suspended
according to the school regulations.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:21.760
Let's move on.

00:45:21.844 --> 00:45:23.679
Is it the Archery Team's turn?

00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:25.848
<i>Petition for Dismissal?</i>

00:45:25.931 --> 00:45:27.891
Is Coach getting fired, then?

00:45:27.975 --> 00:45:28.976
What happens to us?

00:45:29.059 --> 00:45:31.311
Wouldn't the school get us a new coach?

00:45:31.395 --> 00:45:32.312
Yeah, right.

00:45:32.396 --> 00:45:34.273
Who would come and ruin their career?

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.525
Hey, stop speaking like a jerk.

00:45:36.608 --> 00:45:38.068
Stop being so optimistic.

00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:41.572
Hey. Mr. Sensitive and Mr. Rude,
stop fighting.

00:45:41.655 --> 00:45:44.283
Stop fighting.
Why do you two fight at every chance?

00:45:44.366 --> 00:45:45.284
Stop fighting.

00:45:48.704 --> 00:45:50.372
They weren't really fighting…

00:45:51.874 --> 00:45:54.126
Geez. It's still the same.

00:45:55.419 --> 00:45:58.547
Gosh. It hasn't changed one bit.

00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:01.467
This looks like a good spot.

00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:09.558
What are you doing?

00:46:09.641 --> 00:46:11.518
Because I'm suspended,

00:46:11.602 --> 00:46:14.313
- they kicked me out of my dorm.
- So?

00:46:14.396 --> 00:46:16.565
I had nowhere to go.

00:46:16.648 --> 00:46:19.109
Outsiders aren't allowed in the dorms.

00:46:19.193 --> 00:46:20.068
Please leave.

00:46:22.571 --> 00:46:25.365
Lights out. All rolls have been called.

00:46:25.449 --> 00:46:26.533
Lights out now!

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:27.743
Hey, turn it off.

00:46:27.826 --> 00:46:29.828
If I get caught, you'll be accomplices.

00:46:29.912 --> 00:46:30.913
Hurry.

00:46:52.059 --> 00:46:54.603
TRAINING LOG

00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:39.773
Does it hurt a lot?

00:47:51.118 --> 00:47:51.952
It's me.

00:48:07.009 --> 00:48:08.051
Come on out.

00:48:13.807 --> 00:48:16.977
It was stupid of you
to carry the weight of a grown man.

00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:18.562
No wonder your shoulder hurts.

00:48:20.689 --> 00:48:21.940
Don't use it for a while.

00:48:23.358 --> 00:48:25.360
You won't be needing it anytime soon.

00:48:26.445 --> 00:48:29.781
If we had a proper coach,
I would be using it.

00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:31.575
Come on.

00:48:31.658 --> 00:48:34.494
Why would a proper coach
want to take charge of a team like this?

00:48:35.162 --> 00:48:39.124
You should be grateful that I'm here.

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:43.754
Be grateful for what?

00:48:45.922 --> 00:48:48.008
What can you do for us as a coach?

00:48:52.721 --> 00:48:55.307
Can an expelled person
write recommendation letters?

00:48:55.974 --> 00:48:59.269
Can you meet with pro teams
like other coaches?

00:49:00.937 --> 00:49:03.607
What can you teach us
after ruining your own career?

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:08.570
Hey, it's Ju Ga-ram you're talking to.

00:49:08.654 --> 00:49:11.865
No one plays rugby better than me
in this country.

00:49:19.331 --> 00:49:20.624
You're a traitor.

00:49:27.673 --> 00:49:29.675
So what if you did well and worked hard?

00:49:31.426 --> 00:49:35.138
In the end, you betrayed your teammates
and the time and effort you put in.

00:49:40.268 --> 00:49:41.687
You destroyed rugby.

00:49:54.783 --> 00:49:56.952
No. Never.

00:50:00.372 --> 00:50:01.957
I'll never accept you as the coach.

A STAR'S DOWNFALL

<i>Ju Ga-ram, who shocked the nation</i>
<i>with a doping scandal,</i>

00:51:27.834 --> 00:51:29.920
<i>has announced his retirement</i>

00:51:30.003 --> 00:51:33.131

00:51:33.215 --> 00:51:35.467

2022 ASIAN RUGBY CUP

00:53:11.396 --> 00:53:14.816
How can we hire someone
with a doping scandal? He's a disgrace!

00:53:17.152 --> 00:53:18.904
What about "a juicer who got expelled"?

00:53:20.196 --> 00:53:21.448
You destroyed rugby.

00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:22.991
I'll never accept you as the coach.

00:53:34.669 --> 00:53:37.088
<i>I don't think I can play at the finals.</i>

00:53:37.923 --> 00:53:39.674
<i>You're the captain!</i>

<i>We're about to qualify for the Olympics.</i>

00:53:42.802 --> 00:53:44.846

RITE OF VICTORIES 2025

00:54:11.790 --> 00:54:14.334
Let's have the athletes skip
afternoon training today

00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:16.252
so they can participate in the rite.

00:54:16.753 --> 00:54:18.004
Yes, sir.

00:54:18.088 --> 00:54:21.800
The principal will be out on business.
Is it alright for us to begin?

00:54:21.883 --> 00:54:24.177
We can't change the date for the rite.

00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:27.222
I'll try to come back
as quickly as possible.

00:54:27.305 --> 00:54:31.685
By the way, our team's sponsor
would like to donate some money.

00:54:31.768 --> 00:54:34.437
Can I stick that into the pig's head?

00:54:34.521 --> 00:54:37.732
I don't want other teams to feel deprived.

00:54:37.816 --> 00:54:39.401
Yes, it's all right.

00:54:40.151 --> 00:54:43.780
If the Shooting Team performs well,
other teams will watch and learn.

00:54:43.863 --> 00:54:45.281
Yes, sir.

00:54:45.365 --> 00:54:49.619
It's more transparent to get donations
through the administrative office.

00:54:49.703 --> 00:54:51.246
Go through them.

00:54:51.329 --> 00:54:54.457
Also, don't put money on the table
during the rite.

00:54:57.669 --> 00:54:59.004
Safe travels.

00:55:11.933 --> 00:55:13.184
On your marks.

00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:16.980
Get set.

00:55:29.075 --> 00:55:30.368
I'm jealous.

00:55:33.121 --> 00:55:35.248
How can one team hog the field like that?

00:55:35.331 --> 00:55:37.500
The Shooting Team took the gym.

00:55:37.584 --> 00:55:38.960
Where do we train, then?

00:55:39.044 --> 00:55:41.212
What about our coach? Did he say anything?

00:55:48.344 --> 00:55:50.221
We don't have a coach.

00:55:54.059 --> 00:55:55.101
Anyway,

00:55:56.061 --> 00:55:57.312
let's begin.

00:55:57.395 --> 00:55:58.396
Geez.

00:56:01.691 --> 00:56:03.109
- Nice pass.
- I'll pass first.

00:56:03.735 --> 00:56:05.612
- One, two.
- Okay, go.

00:56:05.695 --> 00:56:07.530
- Nice.
- Good.

00:56:16.623 --> 00:56:17.957
He's so full of himself.

00:56:18.041 --> 00:56:20.168
- I hope he fails all his tests.
- Focus.

00:56:20.251 --> 00:56:23.088
How can I? This situation really sucks.

00:56:23.963 --> 00:56:25.757
- Throw harder.
- Darn it.

00:56:27.509 --> 00:56:28.551
Hey, Rugby!

00:56:30.178 --> 00:56:31.221
Hey!

00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:33.515
He didn't cross the line.

00:56:34.974 --> 00:56:36.351
Hyeong-sik.

00:56:49.489 --> 00:56:50.323
Seong-jun!

00:56:50.406 --> 00:56:51.991
- Captain.
- Captain.

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:52.951
- Captain.
- Seong-jun.

00:56:53.034 --> 00:56:54.452
- Captain.
- Are you okay?

00:56:54.536 --> 00:56:56.538
- Hey!
- Are you all right?

00:56:56.621 --> 00:56:59.332
Are you crazy? If he gets injured,
are you going to play for him?

00:56:59.415 --> 00:57:01.459
You guys don't have any matches anyway.

00:57:02.335 --> 00:57:03.336
You know what?

00:57:03.419 --> 00:57:06.172
I might be better
than that shortie or you.

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:07.841
<i>I might be better</i>

00:57:07.924 --> 00:57:09.217
<i>than that shortie.</i>

00:57:10.218 --> 00:57:11.761
No. Don't listen to that.

00:57:11.845 --> 00:57:12.846
No.

00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:14.305
I heard it wrong, right?

00:57:14.389 --> 00:57:15.265
Yes, you did.

00:57:15.348 --> 00:57:17.976
- Stop. You heard it wrong.
- No, I heard it.

00:57:18.059 --> 00:57:19.727
- Hey!
- You son of a bitch!

00:57:19.811 --> 00:57:20.770
Hyeong-sik.

00:57:20.854 --> 00:57:21.896
- Hyeong-sik.
- Hyeong-sik.

00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:23.898
Hey, we'll get punished.

00:57:24.899 --> 00:57:26.025
Why?

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.402
- Hey!
- What's wrong?

00:57:27.485 --> 00:57:28.778
- Geez.
- Crazy bastard.

00:57:28.862 --> 00:57:31.156
Hey, you son of a bitch!

00:57:31.239 --> 00:57:33.032
How dare he. Hey!

00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:37.287
Blood. My face!

00:57:38.455 --> 00:57:39.539
Fuck!

00:57:42.542 --> 00:57:43.710
Hey, come here.

00:57:46.588 --> 00:57:47.589
Come here.

00:57:56.556 --> 00:57:58.475
Everyone stop!

00:57:58.558 --> 00:58:00.435
Please!

00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:08.526
You're dead meat.

00:58:26.252 --> 00:58:27.587
Move.

00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:29.130
TEACHERS' ROOM

00:58:34.511 --> 00:58:36.513
I suppose you're a coach too, after all.

00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:39.140
What happened?

00:58:39.224 --> 00:58:40.683
What do you think?

00:58:40.767 --> 00:58:43.770
The Rugby Team caused a ruckus
and hurt my players.

00:58:43.853 --> 00:58:44.812
What are they? Dogs?

00:58:44.896 --> 00:58:47.273
They go crazy when they see a ball.

00:58:47.357 --> 00:58:49.901
A rugby player ought to chase the ball.

00:58:49.984 --> 00:58:52.445
- Seong-jun.
- Is that so?

00:58:53.321 --> 00:58:55.198
It was the ball's fault, then.

00:58:55.281 --> 00:58:57.200
It should be punished. Give it to me.

00:58:57.283 --> 00:58:59.536
Hand it over. It should be punished.

00:59:00.119 --> 00:59:01.204
What should I use?

00:59:10.964 --> 00:59:13.967
The Rugby Team is banned from training
until further notice.

00:59:14.509 --> 00:59:18.054
We don't want any more trouble
caused by them training without a coach.

00:59:18.137 --> 00:59:21.349
- We do have a coach.
- Didn't your captain tell you?

00:59:22.976 --> 00:59:26.271
The rugby captain has agreed
to dismiss your coach.

00:59:30.567 --> 00:59:32.110
GYM: SHOOTING TEAM

00:59:32.193 --> 00:59:33.736
FIELD: TRACK AND FIELD TEAM

00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:35.905
SECOND HALF OF 2025
COMMON SPACE TIMETABLE

00:59:41.744 --> 00:59:43.538
As the captain, you must be worried.

00:59:44.289 --> 00:59:45.290
Well…

00:59:46.291 --> 00:59:47.750
About the dismissal petition.

00:59:48.835 --> 00:59:51.546
If it passes, what will happen to my team?

00:59:55.758 --> 00:59:58.928
With Ga-ram gone,
I assume things will get better.

01:00:00.054 --> 01:00:02.265
I can find you a new coach.

01:00:08.062 --> 01:00:10.273
You have no reason to be here.

01:00:11.899 --> 01:00:14.527
You have no reason
to participate in the rite either.

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.571
I would like the outsider to leave.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:31.794
The other teams are busy training.

01:00:31.878 --> 01:00:35.256
Let's have the Rugby Team,
who don't have training or a coach,

01:00:35.340 --> 01:00:36.716
prepare for the rite.

01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:45.558
Watch your back.

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:47.101
Set it up there.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:49.520
- Okay.
- I will go first.

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:51.606
One, two, three.

01:00:58.237 --> 01:00:59.155
Are you all right?

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:00.073
Geez.

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:03.284
Don't hurt yourselves.

01:01:08.289 --> 01:01:10.750
Come to think of it, it's pissing me off.

01:01:11.334 --> 01:01:12.669
Why did you agree to fire him?

01:01:14.003 --> 01:01:16.923
He needs to be fired
for a proper coach to come in,

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.716
so things like this won't happen again.

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:22.095
Isn't this also Coach Ju's fault?

01:01:22.178 --> 01:01:25.598
Hey. We ended up like this
because we don't have a coach.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.058
It's not because of Coach Ju.

01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:31.646
Do you think things will change
drastically if Ju Ga-ram is our coach?

01:01:33.064 --> 01:01:34.565
I'm not sure about that.

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:38.486
But I do know you're ignoring
our opinions because you're the captain.

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:47.036
Let's stop. We've already hit rock bottom.

01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.287
Sounds good to me.

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:58.423
WEIGHTLIFTING, TENNIS, FENCING

01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:01.843
WRESTLING, SWIMMING

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:05.513
Rugby is…

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:07.306
"Tennis."

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:12.812
Hold on.

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:14.897
Did I write rugby on it?

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:16.733
No, I think you missed it.

01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:19.026
No. I didn't write it. Take the ball away.

01:02:23.364 --> 01:02:25.783
Why can't the Rugby Team
be a part of the rite?

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:27.452
Did your team win…

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:29.370
even once last year?

01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:32.248
Before it brings bad luck to other teams,

01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.125
take it out.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:41.632
Stop wasting time.
Just take it out when you're told.

01:02:42.383 --> 01:02:43.718
Let's go.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:46.888
Okay. Let's do this.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.396
I'm glad I made it on time.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:57.023
- Is it ready?
- Yes.

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.233
We'll begin the rite.

01:03:01.694 --> 01:03:04.071
In the second half of 2025,

01:03:04.155 --> 01:03:06.073
we wish to achieve good results

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:09.368
without any accidents or injuries.

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:14.040
Next, we will have our vice principal
and sports team manager.

01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:56.666
- A rugby ball?
<i>- Three.</i>

01:03:56.749 --> 01:03:57.834
<i>- Two.</i>
- Hold on.

01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:58.876
<i>- One.</i>
- What's with him?

01:03:58.960 --> 01:03:59.794
Move.

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:08.636
What?

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:42.628
He stuck it into the pig's head.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.005
- It's stuck.
- In the pig's head?

01:04:44.088 --> 01:04:46.173
It pierced the pig's head.

01:04:46.257 --> 01:04:47.425
That's crazy.

01:05:02.523 --> 01:05:03.691
Ju Ga-ram!

01:05:16.078 --> 01:05:17.038
JU GA-RAM!

01:05:17.121 --> 01:05:17.955
- CRAZY!
- AWESOME!

01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.382
EPILOGUE

01:06:58.556 --> 01:07:00.057
THE WINNING TRY

01:07:00.141 --> 01:07:02.226
How dare he botch it up!

01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:03.978
Let's vote on his dismissal first.

01:07:04.061 --> 01:07:06.313
<i>As you know, I don't have much decency.</i>

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:07.648
- Say nay!
<i>- Stay out of my sight</i>

01:07:07.732 --> 01:07:09.066
<i>and lay low until you leave.</i>

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:12.319
<i>Why are you letting those Rugby Team</i>
<i>beasts join the training?</i>

01:07:12.820 --> 01:07:14.030
<i>Rugby Team!</i>

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:15.406
<i>We have a practice match!</i>

01:07:15.489 --> 01:07:18.868
<i>- Will this be enough for us to win?</i>
<i>- You have to learn to lose well.</i>

01:07:18.951 --> 01:07:21.287
I don't need a juicer
teaching me how to lose.

01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:23.080
- The kids hate me.
- The whole country does.

01:07:24.582 --> 01:07:27.835
<i>Soon you'll realize</i>
<i>that they're as hopeless as you.</i>

01:07:27.918 --> 01:07:29.378
<i>Is there any way to win?</i>

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:31.714
From now on, let's play real rugby.

01:07:36.969 --> 01:07:38.971
