00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:15.039
This

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:17.519
Has everything been destroyed to cover up the evidence?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.399
Call the police right away.

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:19.879
I hope he's okay.

00:00:20.879 --> 00:00:22.000
Why are you here?

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.239
Happy

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.920
You're okay?

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.239
I just came to collect a debt.

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.120
What could possibly happen?

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.399
Zhao Daqiang didn't give you any trouble, did he?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.600
Xiao Zhao is a good person.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.039
He's warm and hospitable.

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:38.359
We hit it off right away.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.159
Come on, Xiao Zhao.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:42.000
Big Brother

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.759
Big Brother, Big Brother

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.719
Big Brother

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.479
He won't make things difficult for me.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.560
Right?

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:47.359
Yeah, that's right.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.799
I've brought the money for Big Brother.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:49.679
It's a bit heavy.

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.359
How about I send someone to help you carry it back?

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.280
Send it to my company.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.399
Alright, alright.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:56.000
So polite.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:56.759
It's nice to have a lot of people.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:58.840
Let me introduce you.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.159
This is my wife, Su Qingyan.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.560
Hello, Sister-in-law.

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:04.400
Sister-in-law

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.480
Her best friend, Shen An'an.

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:07.680
Hello, Second Sister-in-law.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.799
No, no, no.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.000
Don't call her that.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.000
There's no such thing as a second sister-in-law.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.640
Remember that.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.719
Play less mahjong from now on.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:14.599
Be a good person.

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:15.840
Contribute more to the country.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.840
Yes, yes.

00:01:17.519 --> 00:01:18.280
Big Brother is giving a lecture.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.319
Did you all hear that?

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.799
We heard.

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.000
Play less mahjong, be a good person.

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:25.200
Take care, Big Brother.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.719
Take care, ladies.

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.840
Now no one will bother us.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.680
Let's have some quality time together.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.239
Why are you back?

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:46.200
You didn't really get the money back, did you?

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.280
How could that be possible?

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:49.640
The money is right here.

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:51.640
You can count it yourself.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.200
You didn't just fill a bag with scrap paper to trick me, did you?

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.480
With your small build,

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:59.719
you went alone to Sanhe Company to collect the debt,

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.079
and came back without a scratch? How is that possible?

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.800
Do you believe me now?

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.400
Still don't believe it?

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.719
You can call and ask.

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:31.039
Mr. Zhao.

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:32.520
Su Zhengdong, you've got guts.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.960
You deliberately brought in an expert.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.319
One person took on thirty of us.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.719
I'll remember this.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.319
Next time I see you,

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:40.680
I'll kill you.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:42.240
No, wait—

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.319
Mr. Zhao, listen—

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.759
Well?

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.080
Do you believe me now?

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:50.360
From now on,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.879
this place is my office.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.080
Please.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.639
Let's go.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.560
Hey, you—

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.919
You—

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.159
Young Master Song, Young Master Song

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.759
Something's wrong!

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.199
That kid Gao actually managed to collect the debt!

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:26.520
What?

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.039
Since when is Zhao Daqiang so easy to deal with?

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.719
Oh no

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.680
That's not it

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.439
Zhao Daqiang told me

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.479
they were beaten up by that Gao guy.

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:36.319
He fought all thirty of them by himself.

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.439
One person took on thirty?

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.120
Do you think this is some martial arts movie?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.759
Oh man

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:41.439
Young Master Song

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.199
It's absolutely true!

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:46.159
How is that kid so good at fighting?

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.039
Now

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.840
he's not only completely offended Zhao Daqiang,

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.919
I'm afraid I won't be able to keep my position as deputy general manager either.

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:54.719
Why are you panicking?

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.719
Even if he's good at fighting,

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.039
he's just a simple-minded

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:59.439
musclehead and a useless brute.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.919
Here's what we'll do

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.319
Have him keep collecting debts at Jin Zun.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.759
I actually want to see

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.599
if he'll even dare to fight Liu Xin from Jin Zun.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:15.680
That's right

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.079
I've heard the Liu family has produced several high-ranking officials.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.360
Liu Xin's father, Liu Shanhe,

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.480
has influence in both legal and illegal circles.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:25.959
His background is extremely powerful.

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:27.600
If he dares to hit Liu Xin too,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.879
no one will be able to protect him.

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:31.079
Young Master Song

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.759
You really are wise.

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:33.439
Enough

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:34.560
Go take care of it, quickly.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.240
I can't wait to see this show unfold.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.040
Do you think you can come into my office without an appointment?

00:04:49.519 --> 00:04:51.279
You think just because you collected six million

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.560
you're qualified to sit in this position?

00:04:54.079 --> 00:04:55.120
Keep dreaming.

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:56.279
Let me tell you,

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.800
Sanhe isn't the only company that owes us money.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.160
The real big debtor is Jin Zun Group.

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.399
If you can recover the debt from Jin Zun Group,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.120
then I'll be impressed.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.319
Fine.

00:05:11.959 --> 00:05:13.240
Jin Zun Group, right?

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.279
I'll make you truly convinced.

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:21.199
If you really can recover the debt from Jin Zun Group,

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:24.040
not only will I give you my position as deputy general manager,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.519
I'll give her to you as well.

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:32.680
As the deputy general manager,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.879
it's my duty to collect debts.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.240
I'm not doing this for her.

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.199
If you win,

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.720
I promise I'll keep my word.

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:48.759
Sanhe Company has been entrenched in Yuncheng for years.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.560
Their boss, Zhao Daqiang, is notorious for being ruthless.

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:53.639
Why is he so easy to talk to today?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.600
He actually agreed to pay back millions in debt just like that.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.120
It's more than just being easy to talk to.

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:00.160
Didn't you see how Zhao Daqiang treated Gaoxing?

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:02.120
He was nodding and bowing like a lackey.

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:03.680
It's unbelievable.

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:06.560
Is Gaoxing really that impressive?

00:06:07.759 --> 00:06:10.160
Didn't you say Gaoxing is good at fighting?

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:13.879
Maybe he beat up all the Sanhe guys.

00:06:13.879 --> 00:06:14.839
How is that possible?

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.439
Those people from Sanhe Company

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:17.519
are all tough fighters.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.600
Gaoxing is just in good shape,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.639
he's not a special forces soldier.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.360
How could he take on dozens of people alone?

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.079
Maybe he's someone from the underworld.

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:29.079
Maybe he's that

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:31.079
low-key, mysterious crime boss.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.399
And he has connections with Zhao Daqiang.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:36.079
That's even less likely.

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:38.319
Gaoxing is just a delivery guy.

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:40.959
He has nothing to do with any big shots.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.079
Then what on earth is going on?

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:47.279
It can't be that they just hit it off at first sight, right?

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.360
I can't figure it out either.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.160
It's really a complete mystery.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.199
Hello?

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.399
I got it.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:00.800
Qingyan, something's wrong.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.160
Your husband is in big trouble.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.720
He went to Jinzun Group to collect a debt.

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:05.240
What?

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:13.759
Haoyang

00:07:14.439 --> 00:07:16.920
I heard you were going to marry the most beautiful woman in Yun City.

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:19.519
But she ran away from the engagement party.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.519
What exactly happened?

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.000
Young Master Liu

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:25.079
I came to see you about this.

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:26.920
The Su family had clearly decided long ago

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.360
to marry Su Qingyan to me.

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:29.560
But Su Qingyan,

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:31.079
she just has to go against her family.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.959
I want to teach her a lesson.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.279
Make her company go bankrupt.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.120
So I wanted to ask you for help, Young Master Liu.

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:40.360
The money you owe Qingmu,

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.600
make sure not to pay her back.

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:48.639
If you ask me to pay back the money,

00:07:49.839 --> 00:07:51.680
I might not do you the favor.

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.199
But if you ask me not to pay,

00:07:54.319 --> 00:07:56.560
I'll definitely do you this favor no matter what.

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:57.040
Oh wow

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.920
Thank you, thank you.

00:07:59.079 --> 00:07:59.879
By the way, Young Master Liu,

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.439
Su Qingyan found some guy outside.

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:03.959
He's really skilled.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.319
Not long ago, he helped her collect a debt from Sanhe.

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:09.920
He even beat up Zhao Daqiang.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.839
You'd better be careful.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.959
Who does Zhao Daqiang think he is?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.600
He's not even worthy of being compared to me.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.480
Oh please

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.439
In Yun City,

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:22.160
if you're a dragon, you have to coil for me.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.759
If you're a tiger, you have to lie down for me.

00:08:26.519 --> 00:08:27.319
Yes, yes, exactly.

00:08:27.959 --> 00:08:28.639
Young Master Liu

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.560
Young Master Liu, you're so powerful.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:30.639
Let me toast to you.

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:33.559
You can't go in.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:35.960
You can't go in.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:42.919
Is Liu Xin from Jin Zun Group here?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.039
Who do you think you are?

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:45.399
Who let you in?

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.440
Young Master Liu.

00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:48.879
This is the guy I just told you about.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.480
So you're here to collect a debt from me?

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.720
Do you even know who I am, Liu Xin?

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.799
Do you know what my status is in Yun City?

00:09:01.759 --> 00:09:03.200
I don't care about your status.

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:05.360
I only know you owe Qing Mu fifteen million.

00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:07.960
If you owe money, you have to pay it back.

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:09.440
Kid.

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:11.120
How dare you talk to Young Master Liu like that?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.519
Are you looking for trouble?

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:15.879
No one dares talk to me like that.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.919
In all of Yun City, you're the first.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.039
Since you have the guts,

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:22.320
slap yourself a hundred times right now.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.240
Then kneel and kowtow to me a hundred times.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.879
After that, crawl out of here.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.639
Then I'll let you go.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.600
If you pay the debt honestly,

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.559
I'll let you go today as well.

00:09:33.879 --> 00:09:34.519
Otherwise,

00:09:34.559 --> 00:09:35.639
don't blame me for being ruthless.

00:09:37.799 --> 00:09:39.039
Ruthless?

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.159
What are you going to do?

00:09:41.559 --> 00:09:42.360
Hit me?

00:09:43.039 --> 00:09:45.039
I've ruled Yun City for so many years,

00:09:45.039 --> 00:09:47.840
and no one has ever dared lay a finger on me.

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.679
Come on.

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:52.879
Hit me.

00:09:54.039 --> 00:09:54.919
Hit me right here.

00:09:57.679 --> 00:09:58.919
Are you okay, Young Master Liu?

00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.679
You...

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:00.799
You...

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:02.039
You really dared to hit me.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.639
Weren't you the one who told me to hit you?

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:04.639
This is the first time I've seen

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:05.840
someone make such a request.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.759
Of course I had to oblige.

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:07.879
How dare you lay a hand on Young Master Liu!

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.799
You're finished.

00:10:08.799 --> 00:10:10.559
No one in the whole of Yuncheng can protect you.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.320
You're asking for trouble.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.320
Guards!

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.000
Wait!

00:10:20.039 --> 00:10:21.000
Honey

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.000
Why are you here?

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.000
You have the nerve to ask?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.480
Do you have any idea how much trouble you've caused?

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:27.080
Mr. Liu, I'm sorry.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.720
He's one of our people from Qingmu.

00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:29.879
He was very disrespectful to you.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.720
I, Su Qingyan, will take full responsibility.

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:32.799
You take responsibility?

00:10:34.559 --> 00:10:35.759
Even my dad has never hit me.

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:36.519
But he hit me.

00:10:36.559 --> 00:10:37.960
Can you really take responsibility for that?

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.399
Mr. Liu

00:10:39.679 --> 00:10:40.480
Here's the situation.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.879
He was ignorant and reckless.

00:10:41.879 --> 00:10:43.039
Please be generous and forgiving.

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:44.320
Let him off just this once.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:46.000
I apologize to you on his behalf.

00:10:48.879 --> 00:10:49.759
Apologize?

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:50.559
What,

00:10:50.559 --> 00:10:52.200
you think a bow is enough to settle this?

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.159
Do you really think

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:54.759
I'm that easy to brush off?

00:10:57.159 --> 00:10:57.960
Mr. Liu

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.559
What do you want me to do?

00:10:59.559 --> 00:11:01.039
I'll do my best to make it up to you.

00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:02.200
Make it up to me, huh?

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:02.960
Alright.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:03.960
Come on.

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:11.159
Show some sincerity first.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.399
Drink this glass of wine for me.

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:14.480
Mr. Liu

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.240
Qingyan can't drink.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.399
I'll drink it for her.

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:18.320
Who do you think you are?

00:11:18.559 --> 00:11:19.799
Stay out of this.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.519
I want her to drink it.

00:11:25.039 --> 00:11:25.840
Honey

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.320
You don't have to drink this.

00:11:34.399 --> 00:11:35.960
Qingyan, are you okay?

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.919
Young Master Liu.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.120
Are you satisfied with this?

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.159
You think one glass of wine is enough to please me?

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.240
Come on.

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:43.519
Drink this whole bottle for me.

00:11:43.759 --> 00:11:44.879
Qingyan, you can't drink.

00:11:44.879 --> 00:11:46.480
If you drink this whole bottle, something bad will happen.

00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:48.799
What?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.720
Not drinking?

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.159
Then you can just wait to collect his body.
