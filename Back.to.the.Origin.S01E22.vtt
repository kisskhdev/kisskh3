WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:35.451

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Dr. Fu's

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.640
really nice,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.720
but he's just...

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.440
How do I put it?

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.360
A bit shy.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.080
Okay.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.640
So later, please

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.600
be a little patient with him.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.800
I get it.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.560
He's here. Come over here.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.880
Let me introduce you.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.680
This is Yudong, Dr. Fu.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.240
Hello, Dr. Fu.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.840
Hi.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.680
She's offering her hand.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.080
Look, what did I tell you?

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.240
This is Ms. Ma,

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.160
the actress playing Mrs. Fu.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.920
Now you've met.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.800
Let's work well together.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.280
Can you give us a moment?

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.800
Why not go touch up your makeup?

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.479
Thanks.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.240
Sure.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.080
What's going on? Who is she?

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.480
This is the brand image story

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.320
Michael specially

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.680
planned for you.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:21.640
Michael!

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.840
Come over. Mr. Fu's here.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.840
Explain it to him.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.680
Mr. Fu's here?

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.720
Mr. Fu, please look.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.440
Do you like it?

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.120
We've found

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.600
the most professional

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.760
team in Lucheng.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.600
Take a look.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.040
From inside, it looks

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.120
almost identical

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.120
to Canada.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.680
This whole set...

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.480
Easy. Slow down.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.440
Let's not rush.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.760
I'll walk you through everything.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.720
This turf is imported from America.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.480
Four times the domestic price.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.480
You can't tell it's fake

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.960
unless you get down and look closely.

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.520
Feel how soft it is.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.920
Play the music.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.000
Soft, right?

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.880
It's so realistic.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.520
Now look at

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.960
this LED screen.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.640
LED...

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.920
I heard

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.040
Hollywood uses these

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.200
for filming.

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.560
This alone costs over 300,000 yuan.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.640
That's insane.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.560
The budget for

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.240
this whole package

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.600
definitely went

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.440
way over,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.600
but Mr. Xing specifically

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.560
told me that

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.200
our top priority now

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.800
is to elevate Dr. Fu's

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.920
personal brand value.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.160
So I

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.400
designed this set

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.680
to meet

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.320
your...

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.079
Yes?

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.280
The set's fine,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.160
but

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:34.200
why did you arrange

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.040
a fake wife for me?

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.520
Mr. Fu,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.200
this is for our brand story.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.200
What brand story?

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.800
Please sit.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.120
Mrs. Fu has sensitive skin.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.760
For years,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.760
she's suffered

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.200
from skin problems.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.079
Dr. Fu

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.880
happens to be a chemistry PhD

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.120
and worked at a major American

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.360
personal care company

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.320
as Chief R&D Officer.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.880
Who?

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.640
You.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.560
Me?

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.840
So Dr. Fu led

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.440
his team to create

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:03.200
skincare products

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.800
suitable for Asian skin,

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.400
our star product,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.680
Dr. Fu's Anti-Allergy Essence Set.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.400
Jesse.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.160
Bring the samples

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.760
we're using

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.160
today.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.000
Okay.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.440
What is all this nonsense?

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.959
Wait, what is this?

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:22.840
Product samples.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.640
That's a big deal. Why didn't

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.960
you discuss this with us?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.320
No, Mr. Li, you've got it wrong.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.560
These are just props

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.720
for today's shoot.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.160
See?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.320
They're all white bottles,

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:32.720
so it's easy to modify

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.440
the packaging design later.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.120
How could I

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.000
make such an

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.760
important decision

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.080
without your approval, right?

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.960
And minor details

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.880
like this

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.480
are best left to the professional

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.280
team.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.120
Today's real focus

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.880
is helping Dr. Fu

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.200
and his wife

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.120
relive their

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.240
happy memories

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.080
from Canada

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.520
in our filming setup.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.520
Sorry, I can't do this.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.280
That brand story

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.920
thing

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.520
is already hard enough to swallow,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.280
and now a fake wife?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.080
That crosses the line.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.120
Why are you looking at me?

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.720
Your brand ambassador

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.400
just walked off.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.440
Shouldn't your

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.200
professional team

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.240
deal with that?

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.560
Jesse!

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.600
It's fine.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.159
Go back to your work.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:58.760
Keep the music going.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:08.840
Nice job.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:10.280
Really,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.160
he needs to be

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.040
put in his place.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.840
Making samples

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.160
without telling us?

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.160
He really thinks we're just decoration?

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.800
I'm not attacking him personally.

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:23.520
I know.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.720
But honestly,

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.720
you still need to

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.720
cooperate with

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.600
Michael today.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.160
He's been running around

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.320
setting all this up.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.520
It's not easy.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.159
I know what you're thinking.

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:40.040
But look,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:43.520
you're the brand ambassador.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.600
What does that mean?

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:48.159
You're playing Dr. Fu,

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.680
get it?

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.520
That girl too.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.320
She's playing Mrs. Fu.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.000
It's not like she's going home with you.

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.200
What are you thinking?

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.080
Chill out.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.240
Besides, do you know

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.640
how much today's production

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.360
costs with

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.320
all these people?

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.680
I'm paying half of it.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.800
There's no turning back now.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.120
That's being professional,

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:12.280
understand?

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:14.240
And hey,

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.560
you look pretty sharp

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.000
in that suit today.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.040
Alright.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.720
It's fine. Just still photos.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.040
I asked.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.480
Just an elevator ad

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.000
and some posters.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.480
That's it.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.440
The girl won't even show her face.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.480
Just her back.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.520
If she's okay with it,

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:36.960
what are you fussing about?

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.960
You're a man.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.840
Be cool about it.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.560
Dr. Fu,

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.680
could you tell us about

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.240
the brand story for this product?

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.080
I remember

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.520
when we were in Canada,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.440
then my wife, she...

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.360
Director,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.600
can I do that again?

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.440
Yudong, cheers.

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.800
Nian.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.000
Nian.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.320
Here, open up.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.200
Open your mouth.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:24.080
Good boy.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.800
What?

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.560
Never seen

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:31.240
this loving father side of me?

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.320
What's special about that?

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.120
Isn't that how you should be?

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:34.880
Honestly,

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:35.799
if I

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:37.200
hadn't brought him today,

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.480
I'd have taken you to

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.240
that street stall.

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:40.600
That one's really good.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.039
Taking your son to a BBQ place?

00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:43.919
Really?

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.200
If Cheng Man finds out,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.000
she'll kill you.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:46.640
She makes me

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.040
eat like a rabbit every day.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.240
Ever had greens

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.240
boiled in just water?

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.200
I have to sneak out

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.400
to eat something decent.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.720
But honestly,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.840
their chicken wings

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.280
aren't as good as the street stall's.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.360
You know why they charge so much

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.320
and still get customers?

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:07.080
Because they're good

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:07.960
at telling stories.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.200
At the stall, they're just grilled wings.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.400
But here? These're called

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:13.160
Flying Wings.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.920
They claim the chickens

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.800
are free-range in the forest,

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.240
can give a kick

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.280
ten meters up into trees,

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.840
and lay eggs up there

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.800
instead of on the ground.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.080
Sounds amazing, right?

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.840
What we need

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.760
to do now is find

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.920
every possible way

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.400
to promote

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:39.000
and tell stories.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.160
I'm just frustrated.

00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.320
I wanted to do real work,

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.440
real R&D,

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.240
but now

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.320
I'm a model being

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.640
ordered around for photos.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.720
How ridiculous.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.240
That's not bad.

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.800
Look at me.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:56.960
I've basically

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.720
become a human bottle opener,

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.840
and I

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.080
drink till I'm a complete mess.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.640
Wanna swap?

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.200
Control your kid.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.080
What is he even watching?

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.640
Stop watching. Put it down.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.120
Put the phone down.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.640
You hear me?

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.520
Take your bottle and toast your uncle.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.160
Stop it.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.480
Come on, toast to your uncle.

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.240
Cheers.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.680
Is this how you parent?

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.480
Yudong,

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.960
let me give you some real talk.

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.240
If you

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.040
still want to make money today

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.440
and give your family a better life,

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.040
you can't take

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.640
everything seriously.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.440
Looking good! Nice!

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.240
Goal! Goal!

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.920
Beautiful!

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:28.560
Lin Dajie!

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.840
Guys! Guys!

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.280
I've got some great news.

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.960
My buddy Yudong

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.520
just got an offer

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.880
from the Royal

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.560
University of Toronto.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.080
A joint master's and PhD!

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:52.640
Great!

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.640
Daoqi, stop shouting.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:55.360
Get down from there.

00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:56.800
To celebrate,

00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.000
I'm buying everyone two beers!

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.240
Yeah! Yeah!

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.480
Yudong! Yudong! Yudong!

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.480
Yudong! Yudong! Yudong!

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.240
Master's to PhD!

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.200
Master's to PhD!

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.160
Yudong! Yudong! Yudong!

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.240
Yudong! Yudong! Yudong!

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.920
Master's to PhD!

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.920
Master's to PhD!

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:23.920
Master's to PhD!

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.760
Come in.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:36.640
Mr. Li, are you...

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.480
You're already eating?

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.240
Is that homemade?

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.400
Mrs. Li's so thoughtful.

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.360
It's leftovers from last night.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.880
Leftovers?

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.880
Very thrifty of you.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.720
My wife

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.160
eats super healthy,

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.320
like an athlete.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.480
My mom, afraid I wouldn't eat well,

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.640
braised some pork for me.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.120
There was so much left yesterday,

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.920
and my wife told me to throw it away.

00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:57.680
Am I crazy?

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.760
Throw away braised pork?

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:00.160
So I brought all of it for lunch.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.120
Leftover braised pork

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:02.920
is delicious, actually.

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.400
Same with

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.360
overnight curry.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.480
You like leftovers?

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:07.760
Then take it all.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:09.800
No, thanks.

00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.160
I'll head out.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.320
Call me if you need anything.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:12.840
Okay.

00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.240
What did you come in here for?

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:16.200
Lunch.

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.200
What's for lunch?

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.480
The company lunchbox.

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.280
Worse than leftover braised pork.

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:21.440
I'll leave you to it.

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.960
Alright, alright.

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.000
Good.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.160
You guys get back to work, go on.

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.920
Did you see Ran's video?

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:50.920
Pretty funny.

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.680
I think she could go viral.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.880
But I have to remind you

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.480
your marriage to her

00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.920
should stay under wraps.

00:13:59.120 --> 00:13:59.800
Got it?

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.760
Why keep it secret?

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.600
We're legally married.

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.720
Our brand

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.680
targets high-end clients.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.160
You're the face of the brand.

00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.760
You gotta protect your public image.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:09.480
I'm going to the factory

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.880
at 3:30 PM to check the production line.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:11.720
You wanna come?

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.200
Tech stuff's not my thing.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.320
You handle it.

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.160
I've got

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.160
got several meetings this afternoon

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.120
and an industry

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.440
summit tonight.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.880
Go by yourself.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:22.960
Jesse,

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:24.560
is the car ready?

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.880
Yes, Mr. Li.

00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.520
Let's go.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.200
Okay.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.520
We'll head out then.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:30.760
Lots of people there.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:31.880
Hand out more business cards.

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.960
I brought five boxes.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.680
If they don't take them,

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:34.320
I'll just stick them under

00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:35.200
windshield wipers.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:48.720
Did you hand out

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.640
all business cards?

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.440
Yeah.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.760
What about your three boxes?

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.560
All gone.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.200
I gave the last

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:56.640
two to the waiters.

00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.560
Not a single one wasted.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.240
Good, mission accomplished.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.440
But that buffet,

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.280
I have to say, is awful.

00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:06.640
If I'd known it'd be that bad,

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.560
we should've eaten

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.200
before we came.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:09.880
You didn't have much?

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.240
I didn't eat a thing.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.600
I know this amazing

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.920
BBQ place nearby.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:17.040
Not far. I can take you there.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:17.880
BBQ?

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.440
Yes.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.480
Tell Chen where to go.

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:21.320
Okay.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.280
Mr. Chen,

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.320
turn right at the light up ahead.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:23.640
Got it.

00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.320
Step on it,

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.520
but drive safe.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.240
No problem, Mr. Li.

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.600
Great, now everything is perfect.

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.360
Yeah.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:38.000
It's good.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:39.840
Really good.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.000
Glad you like it.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:42.640
How did you even find this place?

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.400
If I saw these lights from outside,

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.880
I wouldn't dare go in.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.120
It doesn't look like a BBQ joint.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.840
I've had zero resistance

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.480
to BBQ since I was a kid.

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.400
Once I smell the cumin

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:56.120
and charcoal,

00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.640
I just can't walk away.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.640
Mr. Li,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.880
I really admire you.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:01.800
Really.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.800
You can

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.080
handle those fancy dinners.

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:06.600
Yeah.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.200
You're elegant, polished, and eloquent.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.760
And you can grab

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:12.560
BBQ with a subordinate like me

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.480
like regular folks.

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.040
Not every boss can

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:15.880
pull that off.

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:17.400
Come on.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.440
I am also ordinary.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:22.360
I'm from

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.120
a working-class family,

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.040
seriously.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.480
When I was a kid,

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.160
my mom worked night shifts,

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.720
so she had no time to cook dinner.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.840
She just left some cash on the table

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.280
and told me to go eat downstairs.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.800
I'd head straight

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.280
to the BBQ place downstairs.

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.600
The guy made incredible grilled beef tendon,

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:40.320
really.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.200
0.5 yuan a skewer at first,

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.120
and 2 yuan later.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.640
After a few years, the place shut down.

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.680
No idea where the owner went.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.120
After I got married,

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.640
well, my wife...

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.320
She likes eating vegetarian.

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.520
Like, strictly vegetarian.

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:55.920
And she

00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.640
told me she read some study

00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.120
saying BBQ causes cancer.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.960
But based on my years of experience,

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:03.720
I think not eating BBQ

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.440
might kill me.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:06.200
Well,

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:09.280
which is worse?

00:17:09.839 --> 00:17:10.839
It's hard to say.

00:17:10.839 --> 00:17:11.520
Indeed.

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:12.960
Mr. Li,

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:15.800
I love meat too.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.400
Anytime you're craving it,

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:18.319
just let me know.

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.359
I know tons of places,

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:20.720
good, fun,

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.599
and cheap.

00:17:21.599 --> 00:17:22.560
We can go together.

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:23.599
Deal?

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.319
Deal.

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.160
Deal?

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.200
Of course.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:26.680
For real?

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.800
I finally found myself a meal buddy.

00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.360
Cheers.

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.120
You really know where the fun is.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.520
No, no, no. I'm flattered.

00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:36.560
Great.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.360
From now on, tell me about

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.760
any good spots you know.

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.960
Staying at home

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.080
all the time makes me dull.

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:44.600
Mr. Li,

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.960
you're not busy after this, right?

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.440
Right.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.400
Let's go for a foot massage.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.520
Foot massage?

00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:49.720
You're gonna love it.

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:50.920
Lead the way. I'll pay.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.360
Alright, then I won't hold back.

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.400
Sir,

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.840
is the bottom of my foot injured?

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.640
Why do I...

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.320
You may have a low tolerance for pain.

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.200
Yeah, maybe.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.560
You're right.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.520
I've always wanted to try this,

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.600
but my wife's

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.800
super ticklish,

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.080
so she won't come with me.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:23.880
And I...

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:25.200
I felt kinda awkward coming alone.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.760
So this is your

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.440
first time?

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.440
Yes, first time ever.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.840
Then let me take a photo for you.

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.720
No, no, no.

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.600
Come on.

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.560
He's working on my feet right now.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.920
Let's take photos together.

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:36.440
Let's take one together.

00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:36.960
Hold on.

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.680
One, two, three. Look this way.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.640
One, two, three.

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:40.360
One more. One, two, three.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:41.280
Perfect.

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.000
Thank you.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.200
Awesome.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.160
You really know how to enjoy life.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:49.640
Not bad.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.360
If you like it, we can come again next time.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.200
Alright.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.080
Want him to go easier?

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:56.680
No, I'm fine.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.120
Feels like the more it hurts,

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.800
the more I'm getting my money's worth.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.080
Makes sense.

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:03.960
I'm just kidding.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.960
You don't have to press that hard.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:10.600
Here.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.120
Quick.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.480
Drink some lemon water.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:15.240
It'll make you feel better.

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.440
I'll drink it later.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.160
Later?

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.280
- I'll just leave it here then.
- I...

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.400
I didn't want to wake you,

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.720
so I thought I'd just

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:24.280
crash on the couch,

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.600
but then you got up.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.440
How could I

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.240
sleep soundly when you're not home?

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.920
Sorry, I'm sorry.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.520
Daoqi, listen to me.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.200
Just cut down on these business parties.

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.200
Those parties seem fun,

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.600
people toasting,

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.760
acting like friends,

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.320
and exchanging business cards.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.680
But what does it actually get you?

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.880
It's all empty networking.

00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:49.520
It's different today.

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:50.840
It was just the two of us.

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.000
We didn't even drink.

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.480
More like a tiny team building thing.

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.800
Barbecue for team building?

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.080
Don't forget

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.480
it's a startup.

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.720
Budgets are tight.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.960
Jesse also took me to

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.600
a foot SPA place.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.040
God, the masseur was incredible.

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.320
Traditional technique.

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.520
He pressed one spot on my foot

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.680
and my whole head hurt.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:14.760
Let me show you.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.840
Who's Jesse?

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.800
She's the assistant

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.480
they hired for

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.560
me and Yudong.

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.720
She's pretty fun.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:24.040
Young people nowadays

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.120
really know how to have a good time.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.320
Look, this is the photo she took.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.400
That's the masseur next to me.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.440
He's a genius with

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.480
his hands.

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.480
Pity that you don't like

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.360
going to these places.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.280
Otherwise, I'd take you.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:42.680
And it was cheap too.

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.080
Didn't cost much at all.

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.560
Quite interesting.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.440
We've got older.

00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:52.120
Young ones

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.800
really know how to relax after work.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.400
Well done.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.240
Here.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.440
Shall we add some fruit to the cake?

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.160
Let's add fruit.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.800
Daddy likes mango, right?

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.160
Let's add more.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:23.320
A bit more mango.

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:25.000
Let's add a strawberry.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.280
How about this one?

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.640
Here, you add it.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.960
Is that okay? Good?

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.600
Let's admire our work.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.720
In your hand.

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:35.600
Hold it.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.000
Come on, everyone.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.640
Help yourselves.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.560
Grab a cupcake.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.600
Thank you.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.480
I made these myself.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.360
Please, take one.

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.120
Thanks.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.080
Everyone's been working so hard lately.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:51.560
I didn't know how else to

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.720
show my appreciation,

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.000
so I made these cupcakes.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:55.880
Hope you all like them.

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:56.640
Just a small gesture.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.960
Mr. Li's got such a good wife

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.000
and adorable son.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.880
We're all jealous.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.280
Don't just be jealous.

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:04.920
I put a lot of effort

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:05.640
into winning

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.000
over my wife.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.280
You only see

00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.400
the happy ending,

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.240
not all the hard work I put in,

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:11.960
you know?

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.720
Don't wait around.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.680
Come get them yourselves.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.680
No rush to work today.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:17.880
It's a special day.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:19.680
Let me show you

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.440
my office.

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:21.440
Great, sure.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:22.440
These are for you.

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.360
Nian, let's go.

00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.040
Come on.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.320
Help yourselves.

00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.600
Grab whatever you like.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.040
Don't be shy.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.640
Where is it?

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.360
Up ahead.

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.840
This is for you.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.440
Looks like it fell on the floor.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.440
This way.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.920
This is my assistant, Jesse.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.120
She usually has nothing to do.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.360
Just pretending to be busy.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.080
This is my wife.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:43.960
Nice to meet you.

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.400
- Let's go, Nian.
- Hi.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:46.280
Let me show you something fun.

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.280
Come here.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.640
Being his assistant

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.560
must be exhausting.

00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.720
Here, have some cake.

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:53.640
It'll cheer you up.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.520
Thank you.

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.560
Mr. Li is

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.640
really good to us.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.800
He's so funny and witty.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:58.960
Working for him isn't tiring at all.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.920
He has a lot of

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.040
social events lately.

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:02.840
Sometimes

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.240
I really don't want to call him,

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:04.960
worried it might disturb him.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.000
Shall we add each other on WeChat?

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:07.440
Okay.

00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:08.960
Let's stay in touch.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:09.600
Okay, sure.

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.480
I'll scan you.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.040
Okay.

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:13.800
Here.

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:34.720
You're home so early today.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.720
I was exhausted the past two days.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.080
When I got back, you two were already asleep.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:41.240
Since I'm free today,

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.040
I thought I'd come home

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.160
early to hang out with you.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.480
Where's Nian?

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:46.400
Reading a bedtime story.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:47.840
He said he wanna

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.960
read it himself.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.440
Should be awake now.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.320
I'll go check on him.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:52.960
Daoqi.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:56.200
I have a dinner tomorrow.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.760
Can you come home early

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.480
to take care of Nian?

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.200
No

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:00.880
problem.

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.040
Dinner with whom?

00:24:04.800 --> 00:24:06.440
An old friend you don't know.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.280
You sure?

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.640
Fine.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.080
Can Nian and I eat out then?

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.280
Of course.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.480
Can we eat anything we want?

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.800
Healthy food only.

00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:20.840
[Nian.]

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.080
[Daddy's home.]

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:24.280
[You're so grown up now.]

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.640
[You can read by yourself.]

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.800
[Let me see, what are you reading?]

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.200
[The King and His Little Chick.]

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.120
Man, you're amazing.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.320
These tickets are so hard to get.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.320
But you got them anyway.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.880
And even a signed band album.

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.200
I'm so happy.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.400
Eat to your heart's content.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.040
Today's on me.

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.520
Thanks.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.360
Enjoy your meal.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:04.840
Thanks.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:05.400
Thanks.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.560
You're way too nice,

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.560
even got lobster.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.800
That's totally over the top.

00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:11.800
Please don't say that.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.240
It's my pleasure to treat you.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:15.200
Thanks.

00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:16.520
Before we eat,

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.440
can I take a photo?

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.600
Of course.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:20.720
Thanks.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.160
Pricy food really is different,

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.440
even the plating looks so nice.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:27.640
Done.

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:28.880
Let's eat.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:29.520
Okay.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.640
Jesse.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.880
I want to ask you something.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.880
Why did you choose

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.160
a startup

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:42.320
for your first job?

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.440
Who wouldn't wanna work at a big company?

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:45.520
I wanted it too.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.280
But they didn't want me.

00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.560
I only have a second-tier university degree.

00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.160
No fancy degree,

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.360
no connections.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:53.480
I couldn't even get past

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.920
the resume screening at big companies.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:56.960
And besides,

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.000
I'm from out of town.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:58.720
So once I got the offer,

00:25:58.720 --> 00:25:59.760
I just took it.

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.280
I had no real choice.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.200
Jesse.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:06.880
Did you know that

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.320
ninety-nine percent

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.200
of startups

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.200
only survive

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:14.120
for three to five years?

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.200
I really hope

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.160
your company is

00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.280
part of the 1%.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.600
I hope it grows stronger.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.880
Go public and ring the bell.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:25.880
Then my husband

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.600
can reach the peak of his life.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.760
But

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.800
he can take the risk

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.400
because he has me

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.720
as his family support.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.400
But you're different.

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.880
You're so young,

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.920
alone in an unfamiliar city,

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.400
trying to settle in.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.000
It must be not easy for you to rely on

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.360
yourself for everything.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:46.840
So you need to be careful

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.040
with every step.

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:50.600
Don't take

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.760
unnecessary risks.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.640
I'm telling you this

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.600
because I see you as friend.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.600
Don't mind me.

00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:58.920
I understand.

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.800
Thank you so much

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.000
for telling me this.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.360
But

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:05.560
for me,

00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.760
life is really hard.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.360
My current salary

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.960
is really not

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.400
as high as I expected.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:13.920
My parents,

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:14.840
they have it tough too.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:16.040
It's hard for them to earn money.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.360
They don't have connections either.

00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.320
So,

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:19.880
the most important thing

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.600
for me right now is to make money.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.160
Man, there's something

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.240
I never dared to say

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:25.800
to Mr. Li.

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.400
But I wanna tell you about it.

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.280
I can work harder

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.400
and take on

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.720
more work tasks.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.240
I just hope you could

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.640
talk to Mr. Li,

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:40.040
ask him to give me a small raise.

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:41.680
Just a tiny bit.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.120
I appreciate your honesty.

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:51.080
First,

00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.920
yes, youth is capital,

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.320
but opportunities matter more.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:57.040
Have you heard of

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.280
Xunshuo Group?

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.480
It's a big company.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.520
I know it.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.920
A friend of mine runs it.

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.720
I heard some of their departments

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.760
are hiring assistants.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.280
They're looking for

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:08.320
hardworking and reliable people like you.

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:09.760
I can recommend you.

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.520
Really?

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.520
With my education and experience,

00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:16.480
is that possible?

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.840
I don't want to trouble you.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:18.920
Don't say that.

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.160
You can do it.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.720
Before, you may not have had a choice,

00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:24.720
but now, I'm putting

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.520
the choice right in front of you.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.400
It's up to you

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:30.120
to decide if you want to try.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.120
Of course I do!

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.320
Thank you so much, Man.

00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:36.040
I, uh...

00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.160
Thank you, thank you!

00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.160
Thank you so much!

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.320
You should thank yourself.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:48.680
Excuse me,

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.680
I'm going to the restroom.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:50.200
Okay.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.480
Hello, check for table five, please.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.640
Okay, just a moment.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.600
What are you two doing?

00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.640
We're doing photosynthesis,

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.720
absorbing energy.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.520
Absorbing energy?

00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:29.720
Now that you've absorbed energy,

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:31.440
come absorb some vitamins.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.320
Have some fruit.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.240
I haven't been feeling great lately.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.800
Might need to absorb a bit longer.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.680
You're not feeling good?

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:39.520
What's wrong?

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:40.600
Tell me about it.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.840
The marketing department has

00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:47.560
a planning meeting next week.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.360
I wanted to come up with a plan

00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.640
to compete with

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.600
Michael's team.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.760
But before I finished the plan,

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:58.080
my assistant Jesse quit.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.120
She studied marketing.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.720
I thought with her help,

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:04.920
we could work on the plan together,

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.640
making me look more professional.

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:07.560
Well, guess what?

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:09.760
She quit.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.480
How can I not be worried?

00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.840
Then

00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.640
hire a new one.

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.520
No big deal.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.760
Jesse told me before

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:19.800
she wanted to

00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:21.680
work at a bigger company.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.000
Young people nowadays are all like this,

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.440
aiming too high.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.240
Whichever company is bigger,

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.280
more famous,

00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.280
offers them more money,

00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.400
and they just jump ship.

00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.280
It's fine.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.360
Hire another one.

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.080
You'll definitely find the right fit.

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.560
She went to Xunshuo.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.560
That's your friend's company, right?

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.360
Did you know about this?

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:49.000
It's the weekend.

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.720
Let's not talk about work.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.160
The weather is so nice.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.200
After we finish the fruit,

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.640
let's take Nian out for a walk.

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:55.240
Okay?

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.200
Well.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.400
You guys go.

00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.240
Gotta stay in the study

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.320
to work on the plan.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.760
I can finish it by myself.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:13.280
But, well, why is that?

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.440
Mr. Li.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.440
all departments in the company

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.680
are fully staffed.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.320
We don't have a need to hire anyone new.

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:19.880
But Jesse left.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.280
Now I don't have an assistant.

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.880
As I just explained,

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.080
executive assistants

00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:27.520
are handled by the HR department.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.360
Jesse was

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.600
affiliated with us.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.280
If you don't mind,

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:31.920
I can take on

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.960
your assistant's work.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.160
Then get me a glass of water.

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.280
Just joking.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.800
Even the CFO has his own assistant.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.680
I, the CEO, have no assistant.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.880
Does that make sense to you?

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:48.960
If you really need one,

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.360
I can report to Mr. Xing

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:51.640
to apply for a special approval.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.440
Forget it.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.320
I'll assist myself.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.440
Don't worry, Mr. Li,

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:02.960
we'll deal with it ASAP.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.160

What do you think, Mr. Fu?

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:47.960
Michael.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.560
Isn't this a bit

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.760
far from the real me?

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.040
Not at all.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.600
These are all words you said yourself.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:55.680
But not in

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:56.840
an exaggerated way like that.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:57.480
Well,

00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.160
this just proves

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.400
it was worth the money.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.360
Find a good editor,

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:01.000
after editing,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:01.440
this Dr. Fu will be

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.680
the real you.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:03.840
Marketing

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:04.640
always needs

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.680
some selling points.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.440
We can't just

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.640
copy real life.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.640
Besides, Mr. Fu,

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.440
this has already been

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.600
reviewed by Mr. Xing.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.000
Let's just stick to

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.040
our own jobs,

00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:16.360
and do our parts,

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.600
it's better for everyone.

00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.360
Don't you think?

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.000
I get it.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.280
But you can't just...

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.160
The fruit of the whole team's hard work.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:24.640
Great job this time.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:25.520
Mr. Fu just sang your praises.

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.440
You should thank him.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.600
Thank you, Mr. Fu.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.040
Alright, alright.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.120
Get back to work.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.240
This isn't marketing,

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:47.360
this is blatant coercion!

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:49.880
Using everyone's effort

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.840
to pressure me.

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.640
Did you see the video?

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.800
I asked for an assistant,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.960
and HR said it needs

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.720
special approval from Xing Kai.

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:02.480
I'm the CEO here!

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.200
Worse off than a temp.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:06.960
You have it better.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.520
At least you can still fight for things.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:09.719
Me?

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.560
I have no say at all.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:13.960
What did you want me to see?

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:16.760
The promotional video.

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:19.520
I was bypassed.

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:22.400
He's flat-out disrespecting us.

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:24.400
I will address this at next week's

00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:25.719
middle management meeting,

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:26.719
remind them

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:27.840
who the true backbone

00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.040
of the company are.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.280
How do you usually

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.040
hit this big dumbbell?

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:41.159
Duck your head,

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:42.800
grab that silver bar

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.840
with your mouth,

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:45.920
and hoist it up.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.160
Based on the current analysis report,

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:01.960
we plan to

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.400
start from the third and fourth-tier cities,

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:04.440
gradually expanding

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:04.960
the brand

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.280
to first and second-tier cities.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.560
Penetrate the lower market first.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.440
Sorry to interrupt.

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.920
Dr. Fu is

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.160
an innovative domestic brand.

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.640
If our initial

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.280
business strategy

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.200
is so conservative,

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.080
how can we

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:19.120
join the top ranks later?

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:19.720
Mr. Li,

00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:20.600
you make a very good point.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.360
But it's risky to be too eager

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:22.920
for quick success.

00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:24.760
It's not about quick success.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.360
This is about strategic direction.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.840
We have a price advantage,

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.120
and now we

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.640
have our own

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:33.920
brand story.

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:35.120
We should strike while the iron is hot

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.080
and directly target

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.000
the first and second-tier cities.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.200
I agree with Mr. Li.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:46.960
But Dr. Fu...

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.960
I also agree with Mr. Li.

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.720
Sorry to interrupt.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:49.320
Mr. Li.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.160
Next slide.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.320
Everything I just analyzed

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.880
is based on

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.040
this analysis report

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:56.720
and market

00:35:56.720 --> 00:35:57.760
feedback data.

00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:59.240
Given the company's

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:00.080
current cash flow,

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.200
our top priority should be

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.800
to recoup our investment.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.640
If we pour all

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:04.720
our money into

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:05.880
brand building,

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.480
we might end up

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:07.440
with nothing.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:08.200
So, Mr. Li, I wonder

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:08.920
if the plan

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.000
you just mentioned

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:10.840
has sufficient

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.680
data to support it?

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.400
Data support?

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.840
The data is still,

00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.080
well,

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:25.320
being organized.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.360
But I assume

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.880
we're not sitting in this meeting today

00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:29.120
just to build a

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:30.680
second-rate brand

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.640
in a year or two, are we?

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.240
Our target audience

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.520
is female consumers.

00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:46.680
So we should

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:48.080
collaborate with

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.120
top influencers

00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:50.840
with absolute influence

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.040
among women,

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:52.600
like Lady Wan.

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.560
It's a great idea.

00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.880
But we're a new brand,

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.840
Lady Wan is a top-tier influencer.

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:56.600
How can we ensure

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.000
she'll collaborate with us?

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.760
I have confidence in our products.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:00.600
I have confidence

00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:01.360
in us too.

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.320
But if confidence alone

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.280
guaranteed success,

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:03.720
every street

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:04.920
would be full of entrepreneurs.

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:05.920
Also, Mr. Li,

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:07.640
Lady Wan demands

00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.240
the highest commission in the industry.

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.200
Now isn't the time

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.000
to quibble over money.

00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.800
A famous Chinese entrepreneur

00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:15.840
once said:

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.360
Nothing ventured,

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.320
nothing gained.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:34.320
Mr. Fu.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:36.920
What's your opinion?

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.760
I'm no expert in operations.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.080
But I think we should

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.320
focus most of our energy

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.240
on the product itself.

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.400
Or everything else is just empty talk.

00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.880
Mr. Fu is right.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.480
Try to contact

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.840
Lady Wan

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.000
tomorrow.

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:05.640
How will we know if it works

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:07.240
if we don't try?

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.640
Right?

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:10.000
Got it, Mr. Xing.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:11.880
Then we'll go with

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.160
Mr. Li's plan.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.880
Make the necessary sacrifice.

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.040
Good. Meeting adjourned.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:20.640
Mr. Xing, excuse me for a moment.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.760
See that Michael?

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.560
He really takes himself too seriously.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:39.880
In today's meeting,

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.320
Xing Kai was clearly on our side.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.840
Who does he think he is,

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.360
butting in like that?

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.160
How can you

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.320
propose collaborating with Lady Wan

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.280
right off the bat? That's too reckless.

00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:56.880
Let me tell you,

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.040
the whole point of what I said today

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.520
was to let them know

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.720
our words carry weight

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.640
in this company.

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:05.520
Got it?

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.840
Lady Wan must be contacted.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.440
And it can only be Lady Wan.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.160
Anyone else just won't do.

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.480
If we don't accomplish

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.720
something significant here,

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.640
everyone will just treat us

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:16.480
like mascots.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.400
Here we go!

00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.320
Ha.

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:25.880
Great kick, Mr. Xing.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.920
Not bad, right?

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.600
Yes, really good.

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.520
Come on.

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:32.400
There you go.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.520
Nice shot!

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:35.200
You can't even defend that? On purpose?

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.160
No, no, no.

00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:37.680
Okay.

00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.480
Ha.

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.120
Mr. Xing, not bad!

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:41.920
Cut it out.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:43.080
Mr. Xing.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:44.320
Yudong.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:46.040
We've been waiting for you.

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.360
Come on, join us.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.200
I really don't know how to play soccer.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.840
And I don't have soccer shoes.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.560
What's your shoe size?

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:54.680
Me?

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:56.480
Forty-three.

00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:57.960
You?

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.680
Forty-three.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.400
Take off your shoes for Mr. Fu.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:02.920
Take them off.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.400
Hurry up.

00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:04.920
Okay.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.120
Mr. Fu.

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.200
Put them on.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:14.440
Mr. Xing.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.760
I wanna talk to you about something.

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:17.640
Go ahead.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:18.960
Why else

00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.600
would you come find me?

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.360
Here?

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:21.960
Chop-chop.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.840
We've got

00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:23.880
a game later.

00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:27.600
I was thinking

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:30.880
the stuff in that promo video

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:31.920
is kinda overboard.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.200
You know,

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:36.720
you're good in every way,

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:37.840
except one thing:

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:39.840
you're

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.760
too rigid.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.520
I know we need marketing,

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.200
but it can't be this absurd.

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:45.960
This is basically

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.160
falsification, isn't it?

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.640
How is this falsification?

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:50.800
I told you before,

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.280
marketing is just storytelling.

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:54.520
Right?

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.040
Why do you keep dwelling on it?

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.120
But the problem is I'm the protagonist

00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:58.880
of this story.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:40:59.520
If it were someone else,

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.840
I don't know if they could accept it.

00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:02.360
But I'm thin-skinned.

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:03.320
Can't we just

00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:04.680
tell my real story?

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.240
Listen to me,

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.400
playing soccer and running a company

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.320
are the same.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.280
Everyone just

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.480
has different roles.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.520
For example,

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.480
if I play forward,

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:21.040
I have to charge ahead.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:22.080
If I play midfield,

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.400
I have to provide technical support.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:25.720
If I play defender,

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.480
I have to do

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:28.480
all the dirty work.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.200
To win,

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.480
everyone has to work together.

00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:35.000
I've seen Michael's proposal,

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:36.440
it's good.

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.240
You know,

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.880
that Dr. Fu

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.320
is very charismatic.

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.680
And your real

00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:44.480
academic background

00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.640
makes it even better.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.960
It's so perfect.

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.040
I mean it.

00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.200
Actually, I think

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:52.880
I'm more suited for research.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.280
Maybe you should find someone else.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:03.720
What?

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:05.960
No one can replace you.

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.040
Look at you,

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.000
you're like

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.800
the anchor of the team.

00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.160
You're irreplaceable.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.320
Don't you get it?

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:17.960
Actually, if I just

00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.360
provide technical support,

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.040
I can definitely

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.160
take the team to the next level.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.800
Alright, alright.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.880
I'll have the R&D team

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:34.040
find time to talk to you, okay?

00:42:34.360 --> 00:42:35.240
After all,

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.960
you're a Canadian-returned PhD,

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:40.040
wasting your expertise is a shame.

00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:41.360
Come on.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:43.440
Mr. Xing.

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:45.160
This is just my wishful thinking.

00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:46.800
Whether it's feasible or not

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:48.360
still needs to go through assessment.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:49.120
I get that.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.160
And, Mr. Xing,

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:53.160
Li Daoqi and I have poured

00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.960
all our passion and efforts

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:56.360
into this company.

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.560
Perhaps our suggestions

00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.360
are a bit immature,

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:00.880
we'd be grateful

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.480
for your tolerance and guidance.

00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.240
I'm tired.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:16.720
Need a break.

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:17.920
Hey, you're up.

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.320
Mr. Xing.

00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.040
I'm not very good with words,

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.680
but I didn't mean to offend you.

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.000
Who said you offended me?

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.880
You're the last person in the world

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:30.440
who'd ever offend anyone.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.280
I need to make a call.

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.080
Don't mind me.
