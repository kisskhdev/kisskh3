WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:45.451

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.040
This man is named Meng Hang.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.840
In twenty days,

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.640
he will step into marriage.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:57.719
But

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.840
out of love for his wife,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.719
he’s long since become a husband.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:01.799
Right now,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.000
he’s like any seasoned husband,

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.280
finding every excuse

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.200
not to go home.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.159
What are you mumbling about?

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.280
Why are you still filming?

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.400
Didn’t you say cameras make you tense?

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.319
Four cameras will be on you at the wedding.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.879
I’m letting you get used to it early.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.080
Still, don’t film every little thing, okay?

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:21.719
Relax.

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:22.800
I’ve got loads of experience.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.360
I’ll make sure all the footage passes review.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:26.240
Passes my sister’s review.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.960
I find getting married is like that journey
to the West.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.159
Trial after trial, never-ending.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.199
Each one harder than the last.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.960
Cai.

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.919
Good, you’re here.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:46.240
We’re discussing the pickup route
with your brother‑in‑law.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.879
Come on, let’s finalize the pickup route.

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:52.400
We leave home, get on East Fourth Ring,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.319
and reach the hotel in under twenty minutes.

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.039
No way, that’s way too quick.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.240
Then what’s the point of hiring the fleet?

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.159
What do you mean?

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.000
Here’s what I’m thinking.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.039
We

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:01.240
split into three routes.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.520
Route one

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.719
heads south,

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:04.759
passes Daxing,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.080
loops around to Fangshan,

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.199
reaches Mentougou,

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:08.319
then from due west

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.599
advances toward downtown.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.759
Route two

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:11.719
heads north,

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.960
gets to Shunyi,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.199
pulls a sharp U‑turn,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.199
strikes straight for Tongzhou,

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.360
then from due east

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.599
moves toward downtown.

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.879
Well?

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.960
Are you getting married or going to war?

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:22.919
It’s a motorcade,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.039
it’s meant for people to see.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.199
You’ve got to let everyone,

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.080
the whole of Beijing,

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.800
feel how happy I am.

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.560
What about the last route?

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.080
That one’s a bit tougher.

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:34.439
They start at Deshengmen,

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.599
take Qinghe, Shahe, up to Changping—

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.520
Oh, get lost.

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.919
What’s that supposed to mean?

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:39.719
No, I mean,

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:41.080
I know that route well.

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:43.159
Let’s just head to your hotel first.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.840
Okay, settled then.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.120
No, wait—

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.039
Lily,

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.719
can we

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:50.919
maybe make this wedding

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.639
a bit simpler?

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.360
This is already the simplest.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.319
Any simpler and we cut you out.

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:58.360
That won’t do.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.800
No, what I meant was—

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.120
Sis, my brother‑in‑law means

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:02.039
you’re being a bit extra.

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.680
Hey, Li Cai,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.039
what did you come here for?

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.159
Didn’t you call me over?

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:10.039
You couldn’t say this yourself,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.599
so you needed a mouthpiece, huh?

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:13.800
These are totally Li Cai’s own ideas.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.560
Brother‑in‑law,

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.279
you change your face faster than a page.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.160
Dad, I really don’t get this setlist.

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:29.680
Is it a medley of seven songs?

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:30.839
No.

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:31.480
I’m singing seven full songs.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.519
One by one.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.040
Seven songs.

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:38.360
Isn’t that the time you gave me?

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.839
Ten ten to eleven ten.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.240
That’s one hour.

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.680
That’s the whole ceremony time,

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.839
not just performance time.

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:46.399
But we already rehearsed everything.

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:47.399
Look, at any wedding,

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:48.560
you need festive music,

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.600
playing in the background.

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.879
How about this:

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:52.519
you go through your procedures,

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.079
we’ll play soft when needed,

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:55.040
and we’ll turn it up

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:56.319
to pump up the mood.

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:57.439
Won’t delay a thing.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.519
It will.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.160
Why don’t you have your own wedding?

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.319
Then you can sing all you want.

00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:03.879
What kind of talk is that, kid?

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:05.800
I’m doing all this for you.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.360
Dad…

00:05:08.079 --> 00:05:09.439
I mean it.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.920
Look, my mom’s already found a new partner.

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:14.519
You’ve competed with her all your life.

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:16.079
You can’t lose to her

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.560
in the field you’re best at.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.839
Don’t mention her to me.

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.079
I get mad the moment you do.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.680
She went and found that old geezer.

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.319
What I mean is,

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.639
if my mom can find true love,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.439
you’re not far from happiness either.

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:29.759
I’m not like her.

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.480
I’m fully devoted to my career.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:33.160
True enough,

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:35.399
I haven’t dealt with women in ages.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.920
That last part is really true.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.240
Uncle Meng,

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.279
that’s because you bicker with Aunt Cai daily.

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.480
You don’t need any other women.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.399
Oh, right—

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:45.399
is it that you don’t like her?

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.319
I like her.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.839
Like hell I’d like her.

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:52.879
Listen,

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.920
if she were the only woman left on earth,

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.759
I…

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:57.519
I’d rather become a monk.

00:05:59.079 --> 00:05:59.959
Cut this part, cut it.

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:00.879
This bit won’t do.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.800
Enough, enough.

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:02.680
Stop filming, stop it.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.000
You’ve really got my mind all messed up.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.399
Don’t you people have real work?

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:06.519
Nothing serious to do?

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:07.560
Honestly…

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.040
Suspicious.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.920
Aunt Cai…

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.040
I'll grow to like her.

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.600
I still have one big thing to do.

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.920
Auntie Cai.

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:28.040
My brother‑in‑law sent me to ask you.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.360
Did you send that video?

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:31.000
What video?

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:33.160
The one inviting my dad to the wedding.

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.680
I haven't sent it.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.240
Where would I even find your dad?

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:37.279
Then what do we do?

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:40.800
Just tell him I sent it.

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.160
Your dad is in Africa.

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:42.920
He can't make it back.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.720
So the in‑law dad can't come?

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.120
Why are you eavesdropping on us?

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.639
I'm not eavesdropping on you.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.480
You're in my shop.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.040
Which of us is

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.439
eavesdropping on whom?

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:54.720
You think I want to hang around here?

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.759
If it weren't for Meng and Lili

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:57.959
making out at home,

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:58.839
shoving their love in my face,

00:06:58.959 --> 00:07:00.000
I'd grab some “dog food”

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:01.759
Yeah, there's “dog food” everywhere.

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:02.800
You can sprinkle it on them.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.000
Let's talk business.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.879
Speaking of the wedding,

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:06.720
the two sets of parents

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.040
haven't sat down for a real talk.

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:09.920
Raising Lili all by yourself,

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.319
to be honest, has been tough.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.439
And we're so close already.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.480
So...

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:15.959
we're close, that's all.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.199
There are just some

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.279
things we give and take on.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.759
Don't worry what other people say.

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:23.600
W‑w‑what are you talking about?

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:24.639
We—

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.600
it's the kids' wedding.

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:27.120
Right.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.360
And you’re talking all this

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:29.519
nonsense, serious or not.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.279
I have nothing to discuss with you.

00:07:32.399 --> 00:07:33.319
I, I...

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:34.240
I'm just saying—

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.000
I mean, about that...

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.439
that...

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:36.040
th‑that...

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.959
the dowry and stuff.

00:07:37.959 --> 00:07:39.920
Just a token amount is enough.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.399
Dowry?

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:42.360
There’s even a dowry?

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.560
What I mean is,

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.439
if you must, like one or two thousand...

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:46.040
Two hundred.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.519
Or you could just give a red envelope.

00:07:47.519 --> 00:07:48.279
It’s the custom.

00:07:49.959 --> 00:07:50.959
But...

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:52.720
Where we’re from, we don’t do that.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.879
Aunt Cai is telling the truth.

00:07:58.759 --> 00:08:00.120
If there isn’t, then there isn’t.

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:01.160
That’s what I think too.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.639
I mean, for two people to live life,

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:03.959
being happy together is enough.

00:08:03.959 --> 00:08:05.279
Okay, it’s fine, you don’t pay.

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.000
Wait.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.240
You just reminded me.

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:10.240
We should probably

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:11.959
talk about the bride price.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.759
Bride price?

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.079
You have that custom there?

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:16.759
No.

00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:19.800
But you don’t have it here either?

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.639
Let me look it up online.

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:21.319
No, no, no need, no need.

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:22.800
We have it here, we do.

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:25.920
Then we can’t break tradition.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.199
For us,

00:08:27.199 --> 00:08:28.680
we follow our own rules.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.040
There’s no dowry.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.519
As for you,

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:33.080
you should follow your rules.

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:35.559
So there has to be a bride price.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.799
That never even crossed my mind.

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:42.759
You only thought about my dowry,

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:44.440
not your own bride price.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.799
You’re really something, you know.

00:08:46.879 --> 00:08:47.440
No,

00:08:47.759 --> 00:08:48.399
I...

00:08:48.399 --> 00:08:48.919
That

00:08:48.919 --> 00:08:49.600
money,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.639
I need it to release my album—

00:08:52.039 --> 00:08:53.519
Okay, okay, okay.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.320
Gift money.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.799
The gift money is all yours.

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:57.240
Take it as the bride price, okay?

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:58.600
The gift money...

00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.960
how many people can we get?

00:09:00.679 --> 00:09:01.879
I, I, our side—

00:09:01.879 --> 00:09:03.919
I’ll invite about ten tables.

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:04.759
And you, you—

00:09:04.759 --> 00:09:06.200
no idea how many from your side.

00:09:06.799 --> 00:09:08.519
Good, good, good.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.440
That’s perfect.

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:10.080
No,

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.159
it’s not about the money.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:11.919
Mainly,

00:09:12.159 --> 00:09:13.919
it’s to respect your customs.

00:09:13.919 --> 00:09:14.320
Yes, yes, yes.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.200
Respect, respect.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.039
Mutual respect.

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.879
Usually, for this,

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:28.840
how much do people give in gift money?

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.399
Gift money, what gift money?

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.399
I just give them a video I edited.

00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:36.519
No wonder you have no friends.

00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.559
Let me do the math.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.320
If

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.480
one table seats ten people,

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.360
and it’s five hundred per person,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.600
that’s five thousand per table.

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:49.960
If we have ten tables,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.200
that’s fifty thousand.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.279
We can have ten tables.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.759
The Meng family also has ten tables.

00:09:56.799 --> 00:09:58.759
If we find ten more tables,

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:01.720
we could get 100,000 in gift money.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.360
It’s not like we’re selling tickets.

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.080
How can you be sure they all give five hundred?

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.440
Exactly.

00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:10.519
I can sell tickets.

00:10:11.759 --> 00:10:12.399
Li Cai,

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:13.919
you’re actually useful for once.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.720
Da Liu,

00:10:23.399 --> 00:10:24.120
it's me.

00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:26.840
Some time ago, Old Meng was

00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:29.159
singing at your bar, went great, right?

00:10:30.639 --> 00:10:31.440
Yeah, yeah.

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:33.919
In a couple of days he has another show.

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:35.799
Not at your place.

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:38.080
There's a special venue.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:40.840
Right now I've got

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.639
uh,

00:10:41.679 --> 00:10:42.960
one hundred spots.

00:10:43.679 --> 00:10:44.879
I didn't give any to anyone else.

00:10:44.879 --> 00:10:45.440
I'm giving them to you.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.440
You help me sell them.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.080
It's five hundred per person.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:48.840
Right.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:51.200
But you have to wire me the money first.

00:10:51.799 --> 00:10:52.559
All right.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.639
Deal.

00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.919
The gift money's in the bag.

00:10:58.039 --> 00:10:59.480
Aunt Cai, what do you mean?

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.000
Old Meng,

00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:02.840
he has to sing anyway.

00:11:02.879 --> 00:11:03.879
At the wedding,

00:11:03.919 --> 00:11:05.240
it's all noisy and chaotic.

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:06.399
Who can even tell

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.759
who's a fan and who's family?

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.080
How am I this smart?

00:11:11.559 --> 00:11:12.159
No, I mean,

00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:13.639
haven't you already saved up

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:15.200
enough to go to Antarctica, back home?

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:16.480
Why do you still want more?

00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:20.879
Who ever thinks they have too much money?

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:22.519
I look this good,

00:11:22.519 --> 00:11:23.679
can't I upgrade to business class?

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:25.159
Is that not allowed?

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:25.919
Mom.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:26.799
Li Cai,

00:11:26.879 --> 00:11:27.799
let’s have a meeting.

00:11:37.159 --> 00:11:37.919
Comrades,

00:11:38.279 --> 00:11:39.000
friends,

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.200
first of all, on my own behalf,

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.080
for all your hard work lately,

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.559
I want to say a heartfelt thanks.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.120
And for all of you,

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.519
for what you have achieved,

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:50.919
I want to offer my warmest

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.799
congratulations.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.039
The groom counts as an “official,”

00:11:58.399 --> 00:11:59.399
so today’s meeting

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:01.080
is mainly to plug the gaps,

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.840
check which little details

00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.159
have not been carried out yet.

00:12:04.279 --> 00:12:04.799
Mom,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:05.879
let’s start with you,

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:07.440
start with what you need to do.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:09.840
Uh…

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.080
have you written the speech?

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.440
Our submission deadline

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.600
was yesterday at noon.

00:12:19.039 --> 00:12:20.600
There are still a few days!

00:12:21.039 --> 00:12:21.720
When the time comes,

00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.559
I’ll just talk on stage, done.

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:25.080
What did we agree on before?

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.639
Have you forgotten our plan?

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.080
You should have handed it in

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.120
to Lili yesterday to proofread.

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:32.320
Then Lili gives it to me to review.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.960
I give feedback within eight hours,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.320
then you revise it again.

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:37.320
Lili,

00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:38.360
he, uh…

00:12:38.759 --> 00:12:39.320
well, this…

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:41.240
the, the speech thing

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.519
really is very important.

00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:44.159
Plus, when you talk normally,

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.480
you don’t really filter yourself.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.480
So better be careful.

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:47.360
Right? Isn’t that so?

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:48.360
Better prepared than sorry.

00:12:48.399 --> 00:12:49.399
So about this, um…

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:50.320
you can make up for it.

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.600
I’ll give you an important task.

00:12:51.639 --> 00:12:52.200
This here

00:12:52.679 --> 00:12:54.440
is a key prop for our wedding.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.679
I’m entrusting it to you.

00:12:56.039 --> 00:12:56.919
But remember,

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.519
guard it from my dad like a thief.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.360
Why should you say that?

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.960
Because you can’t keep your hands off.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.200
I’m just…

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.120
fiddling with strings, that’s all.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:06.080
All right, all right, all right.

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.039
Next item.

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:09.559
Ms. Li Lili,

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:12.440
the wedding hall big screen’s

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:14.519
wedding photo, have you picked it?

00:13:15.039 --> 00:13:17.039
I’ve narrowed it down to eight.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.000
Tomorrow I’ll decide on the one.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.879
Which eight? Bring them here.

00:13:19.919 --> 00:13:20.919
I’ll pick it for you right now.

00:13:26.399 --> 00:13:28.159
All eight are just your solo shots?

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.080
You won't let me pick the best one?

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.840
Okay, okay, okay.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.720
L-let's talk about this tonight.

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:34.159
Father, Father.

00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:36.879
Re-rehearsing, I...

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:38.080
I'm just way too sleepy.

00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:39.559
Where are we now?

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:40.639
Is the program list decided?

00:13:40.639 --> 00:13:41.039
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:41.840
All decided, all decided.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.799
For the opening, we’ll start with

00:13:43.919 --> 00:13:44.919
“Endless Love.”

00:13:44.919 --> 00:13:45.559
Which is about

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:48.759
recalling the past,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.519
a love-sick pain you can’t forget.

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:53.519
It’s about a breakup.

00:13:54.279 --> 00:13:56.200
No, it mainly blesses you, like

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.000
you two get along great,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:57.720
three lucky stars above,

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:59.039
and wealth in all four seasons.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.600
Right.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.799
Then we also prepared “Afterwards,”

00:14:01.919 --> 00:14:03.480
wishing you both a brand‑new life.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.720
That one’s also about a breakup.

00:14:04.919 --> 00:14:06.000
It’s mainly to wish you

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.559
j-just, you know,

00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:07.159
good harvests,

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:08.000
and everything going smoothly.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:08.759
That’s

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:09.960
If this one doesn’t work,

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.080
“Ten Years.”

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.080
Wishing your love life will

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.200
end in heartbreak sooner or later.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.799
No, I mean wishing you

00:14:14.799 --> 00:14:15.879
j-just, you know,

00:14:15.879 --> 00:14:16.399
lasting forever,

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:17.240
and ten out of ten perfect.

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:17.720
That’s

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:18.840
what I meant.

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:20.480
If that song won’t do,

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:21.440
aside from the main track,

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:22.919
I only know “I Got Nothing.”

00:14:22.919 --> 00:14:23.240
Dad.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.240
“I Got Nothing” is great.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:24.720
Look,

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.919
Dad, could you please try harder?

00:14:26.919 --> 00:14:27.840
I am trying really hard.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.279
I even wrote the links.

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:28.799
Li Cai.

00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:29.159
I came up with them.

00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:29.759
Li Cai.

00:14:29.759 --> 00:14:31.039
My h-hair’s gone gray.

00:14:31.679 --> 00:14:32.039
Brother‑in‑law.

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:32.360
What are you doing?

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:33.440
I’ve been filming you nonstop.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:34.720
Who told you to record?

00:14:36.519 --> 00:14:38.360
What role did you fight to get?

00:14:38.399 --> 00:14:39.039
Host.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.080
What’s a host’s main duty?

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.840
Looking after the bridesmaids.

00:14:42.279 --> 00:14:42.759
Looking after—

00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:44.000
Right.

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:44.840
the bridesmaids.

00:14:45.039 --> 00:14:45.879
Keke said

00:14:45.919 --> 00:14:47.120
she and the other bridesmaids

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.240
have agreed

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:49.639
that when you show up,

00:14:49.679 --> 00:14:51.879
you must improvise fifty good traits of mine.

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:53.000
Fifty?

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.320
You don’t have that many.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:55.960
You’ve got way more than fifty.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Fifty’s really selling you short.

00:14:58.399 --> 00:15:00.240
Is there anything else besides that?

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.200
They also said, um,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.240
they’ll put lipstick on your lips,

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.320
Darn it, then kiss “LOVE” on my face.

00:15:05.679 --> 00:15:06.559
This is bad, really bad.

00:15:06.679 --> 00:15:07.559
Well, there is space for it.

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.960
That’s the part that worries me most.

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:13.639
What I’m most afraid of

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:14.639
is the best man and bridesmaids

00:15:14.919 --> 00:15:16.919
making trouble during the pickup.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:20.039
Li Li

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.720
Can we just cancel this whole thing?

00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:24.000
Or maybe even cancel the wedding?

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:24.960
No, no, no.

00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:25.919
Uh, well…

00:15:25.919 --> 00:15:27.440
I’m really scared of this.

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.679
But everyone else does it.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.480
Other couples all have this.

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.000
I’m begging you.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:31.960
How about this…

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:32.799
Once this rush is over,

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:33.840
have him write out all your good points

00:15:33.879 --> 00:15:35.080
one hundred times each.

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:37.639
All right then.

00:15:37.919 --> 00:15:40.080
Then let’s follow our family’s custom.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.279
You come pick me up yourself.

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:43.399
The best man and maid of honor wait there.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.080
Okay.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:45.000
Settled, then.

00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:47.200
Everyone,

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:47.840
remember:

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.600
do not mess up at the key moment.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.399
We won’t.

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:51.919
And you.

00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:54.120
Dad, fix up the program list.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:54.759
Yes, absolutely.

00:15:54.759 --> 00:15:56.360
We rehearse at the hotel the day after.

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:57.120
Comrades,

00:15:57.639 --> 00:15:58.679
perk up your spirits.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:15:59.919
Let’s do this!

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:02.960
Don’t get too excited.

00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.039
Get some proper rest.

00:16:09.679 --> 00:16:10.720
The countdown starts now.

00:16:10.799 --> 00:16:12.039
The wedding is tomorrow.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:13.960
Aren’t these flowers a bit tacky?

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:15.080
They’re fabric ones.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:16.799
That’s not important.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.679
The main thing is,

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:20.360
this is all custom-designed by us.

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:22.320
Red and blue make a perfect pair.

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:24.600
So pretty.

00:16:29.879 --> 00:16:30.639
That’s Lao Meng.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:31.639
Lao Meng!

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.080
Hello, sir.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:36.080
I’m

00:16:37.039 --> 00:16:38.080
Guiying’s husband.

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:42.000
Why’d you drag him out here?

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.919
You’re not needed—ship him back.

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:44.799
How can you…

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.159
What’s this got to do with you?

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:49.159
Of course it’s got to do with me.

00:16:49.879 --> 00:16:51.720
I’m here to witness these two kids’

00:16:52.559 --> 00:16:53.679
beautiful love.

00:16:53.879 --> 00:16:54.879
No need, no need, really.

00:16:54.919 --> 00:16:56.480
Their beautiful love’s right here already.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.200
No need.

00:16:58.919 --> 00:17:00.120
When I see them,

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.360
I can’t help thinking of

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:03.879
me and Guiying back then.

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:05.359
Guiying,

00:17:06.039 --> 00:17:07.039
do you still remember?

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.599
Back in those days,

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:10.319
you often

00:17:10.359 --> 00:17:11.839
came to the acrobat troupe to see me.

00:17:12.039 --> 00:17:12.799
And I

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:14.680
often went to the dispatch station

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.039
to pick you up from work.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.680
Can you two stop flirting here?

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.359
If I puke later, who’s to blame?

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:22.000
No, I mean—

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.079
when you were at the dispatch station,

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:24.440
we hadn’t divorced yet, right?

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:28.880
All these years apart,

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.799
how are you still so clueless?

00:17:31.319 --> 00:17:32.720
Can’t you tell what matters now?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Bringing that up now—

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.119
is it really that important?

00:17:35.319 --> 00:17:36.079
No, I just—

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.440
Mom.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:37.880
Li Li.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:38.519
Coming, Mom.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:40.039
This is your Uncle Jin.

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:41.200
Hello, Uncle.

00:17:41.559 --> 00:17:42.240
Hello.

00:17:44.799 --> 00:17:46.079
Staying at the hotel and all that—

00:17:46.079 --> 00:17:46.759
you getting used to it?

00:17:46.759 --> 00:17:47.920
It’s fine, really fine.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:51.759
Well...

00:17:51.759 --> 00:17:52.839
He’s just being stubborn.

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:53.960
Don’t worry about him.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.319
He really hopes you’ll come, actually.

00:17:56.319 --> 00:17:57.039
Really.

00:17:58.079 --> 00:17:59.279
Then I’m relieved.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.319
Don’t worry, really.

00:18:00.319 --> 00:18:01.279
I’ll talk some sense into him.

00:18:01.279 --> 00:18:01.839
Okay.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:02.880
Uncle.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:03.720
Dad.

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:05.480
Rest for a bit.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.440
We’ll rehearse the tea ceremony later.

00:18:07.759 --> 00:18:08.480
All right, all right.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.599
You don’t need to mind them.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.000
Go take care of your stuff.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:10.960
Then I’ll go check on things.

00:18:11.079 --> 00:18:11.880
Sure, go have a look.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.799
Okay, okay.

00:18:13.519 --> 00:18:14.039
Come on.

00:18:14.519 --> 00:18:15.359
Where’s my mom?

00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:16.640
Haven’t seen her.

00:18:18.119 --> 00:18:19.599
Where’d she run off to now?

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:22.480
Stop filming here, okay?

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.279
Go look for her.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.880
Go, go find my mom, go.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:25.519
Hurry up.

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:26.319
Let’s go.

00:18:26.759 --> 00:18:33.000
Meng Qianwan!

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.079
Stop shouting.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.720
What are you all doing?

00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:37.880
We’re here for Meng Qianwan’s concert.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.880
What concert?

00:18:39.319 --> 00:18:39.960
Aunt Cai.

00:18:40.039 --> 00:18:41.200
Didn’t you sell off

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.039
all of our wedding seats?

00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:43.400
Yes, yes.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.319
Well…

00:18:44.599 --> 00:18:46.319
That “concert” is tomorrow.

00:18:47.319 --> 00:18:49.640
We always arrive a day early for concerts,

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.119
sing all night first to warm up.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:53.720
No, listen, sir—

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.480
this “concert,” see,

00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.920
it’s a themed concert.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.440
Wedding themed.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:18:59.279
You guys

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.440
just pretend to be the bride’s relatives

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.519
coming to offer blessings.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:04.880
Got it?

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.720
Got it.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.759
What’s your name?

00:19:08.519 --> 00:19:09.279
I’m Cai Xiaoying.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.039
Blessings to Cai Xiaoying and Meng Qianwan,

00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:13.960
may you share a hundred years of love,

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.240
forever of one heart,

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.680
and soon bear a noble son!

00:19:17.759 --> 00:19:19.319
What nonsense! Stop yelling that.

00:19:19.319 --> 00:19:20.000
Out, out, out!

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.720
Everyone out, out, out!

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.319
Why should we?

00:19:21.319 --> 00:19:23.039
We paid 1,808 for these tickets!

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:24.279
Why are you kicking us out?

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.519
How much?

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.640
1,808.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.480
Aunt Cai, you got scalped.

00:19:28.519 --> 00:19:29.519
I’m betting it was Big Liu.

00:19:30.359 --> 00:19:31.960
Face value was only five hundred.

00:19:32.359 --> 00:19:34.039
Big Liu is so shady.

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:36.160
The concert’s canceled.

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:37.920
Whoever sold you tickets, go find them.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:38.960
How is that fair?

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.440
We came from so far away.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.599
You just cancel like that?

00:19:41.599 --> 00:19:42.599
But the tickets Big Liu gave us—

00:19:43.319 --> 00:19:44.480
Coming to me won’t help you.

00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.319
Right? We just—

00:19:45.319 --> 00:19:46.759
Meng Qianwan, where are you going?

00:19:46.759 --> 00:19:47.759
Aunt Cai, run!

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.279
Mom!

00:20:05.799 --> 00:20:06.799
We’ve been looking for you.

00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:07.680
Rehearsal time, let’s go.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.240
Let’s go.

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:11.319
Next is serving tea to both parents.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:13.640
Go ahead, serve.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.240
Mom, have some tea.

00:20:19.279 --> 00:20:20.160
Tea keeps me awake.

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.079
Drink, drink.

00:20:21.079 --> 00:20:21.559
Mom—

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:22.759
You have to drink this.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.359
Mom, drink the tea.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.279
You owe a red envelope tomorrow.

00:20:31.759 --> 00:20:32.519
I know, I know.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.480
It’s rehearsal, stand in for me.

00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:39.839
Thank you, thank you.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.079
Um…

00:20:43.799 --> 00:20:45.119
A-are you thirsty?

00:20:45.559 --> 00:20:46.559
What are you doing?

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.200
Someone’s in your seat.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:54.519
I can see that.

00:20:57.079 --> 00:20:59.160
This is the groom’s father’s seat.

00:20:59.519 --> 00:21:00.359
Why are you sitting here?

00:21:00.359 --> 00:21:01.039
Get up.

00:21:01.519 --> 00:21:02.400
Old Meng.

00:21:03.279 --> 00:21:05.400
No need to blow up over this.

00:21:05.599 --> 00:21:06.599
He’s taken my seat completely.

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:07.319
And that’s “no big deal”?

00:21:07.319 --> 00:21:08.200
How is this not a big deal?

00:21:08.279 --> 00:21:08.880
You’re partly to blame too.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:10.039
Where did you go?

00:21:10.079 --> 00:21:10.559
I…

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:11.279
I was over there.

00:21:11.279 --> 00:21:12.559
I was getting tomorrow’s music ready.

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:13.680
My band needs me.

00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.480
If they need you, go then.

00:21:15.559 --> 00:21:17.119
Is this chair custom‑made for you?

00:21:17.119 --> 00:21:18.119
We all have to wait for you?

00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:18.920
Guiying…

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.079
Since big brother is back now,

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.759
I’ll just let him have the seat.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.640
You’re not going anywhere.

00:21:24.839 --> 00:21:25.440
Sit down.

00:21:28.759 --> 00:21:29.920
You can sit here,

00:21:30.039 --> 00:21:31.880
but if I perform, he performs too.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.200
He can walk a tightrope for everyone.

00:21:34.519 --> 00:21:35.359
And jump through a ring of fire.

00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:37.279
You can just go straight to that…

00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:38.480
swallowing a Green Dragon Crescent Blade.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:38.960
Tomorrow

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.200
I’ll get you a real Green Dragon Crescent Blade.

00:21:50.119 --> 00:21:51.240
You’ve pissed the kids off; they left.

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.960
Because you were the one making a scene.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.519
Making a scene?

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.519
It’s fine.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.200
Let them blow off steam today.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.559
Tomorrow it’ll be fine.

00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:35.079
Don’t be mad at your mom.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.640
I’m not mad at her.

00:22:38.519 --> 00:22:40.359
Then don’t be mad at your dad either.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.200
I’m not mad at my dad either.

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:44.319
Then what is it?

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.160
Last night my dad got really drunk

00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:51.680
and told me a lot about the past.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.440
Back then,

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.759
my dad loved to mess around.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.119
With his good‑for‑nothing buddies,

00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:02.480
drinking, singing, playing cards,

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.519
gone all day and all night.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.000
I had a fever over thirty‑nine.

00:23:08.079 --> 00:23:10.119
My mom took me to the hospital alone,

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.000
stayed with me all night.

00:23:13.319 --> 00:23:14.279
And my dad?

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.759
He was drunk.

00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:17.519
He went to the wrong home.

00:23:18.599 --> 00:23:20.039
He ended up at the neighbor’s,

00:23:20.079 --> 00:23:21.799
slept on the young couple’s bed all night.

00:23:23.079 --> 00:23:24.079
They called the police.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.000
My mom even went to the station

00:23:27.039 --> 00:23:28.319
to bring him back.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.640
I know my dad.

00:23:31.759 --> 00:23:33.480
He wants me and my mom to make up,

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.519
but he just can’t say it.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.599
They both really love you, actually.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:45.480
I know.

00:23:57.799 --> 00:23:58.839
Just now, I…

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.559
did I go a bit too far?

00:24:01.319 --> 00:24:02.759
That weird temper of yours,

00:24:02.759 --> 00:24:04.400
only I can put up with it.

00:24:04.799 --> 00:24:05.640
Yeah,

00:24:06.279 --> 00:24:07.519
this temper of mine…

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.200
It’s just that

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.960
I got carried away talking.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:11.680
So, uh…

00:24:12.839 --> 00:24:13.400
how about

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.799
you go to Old Meng

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:15.880
and apologize for me?

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.000
Forget it.

00:24:17.279 --> 00:24:19.200
I’m the center of the conflict now.

00:24:19.559 --> 00:24:21.480
I’ll just skip tomorrow’s event.

00:24:22.599 --> 00:24:23.359
That might be best.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.000
I’m really sorry.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.720
Sorry about this.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.920
Hanghang, don’t you worry.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.279
Um, Uncle Jin just won’t come tomorrow.

00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:32.039
Yeah, that’s right.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:33.400
Tomorrow I’ll

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.079
just happen to catch a cold,

00:24:35.799 --> 00:24:37.960
with a terribly, terribly bad headache.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.519
Uncle Jin,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.839
you still have to come tomorrow.

00:24:41.319 --> 00:24:42.839
You, my mom and my dad,

00:24:42.839 --> 00:24:43.920
and Lili’s mom,

00:24:44.119 --> 00:24:44.880
you all sit at the main table.

00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:46.119
That…

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.240
wouldn’t really be proper.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.680
Your dad won’t like it.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.559
It’s my wedding, I decide.

00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:53.640
Mom,

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.720
let’s finish rehearsing

00:24:57.119 --> 00:24:58.079
the tea ceremony first.

00:25:00.559 --> 00:25:01.000
Let’s go.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:01.960
Uh…

00:25:04.079 --> 00:25:04.880
Come on, let’s go, Uncle.

00:25:05.319 --> 00:25:05.960
This is…

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:06.920
Let’s go.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.079
I truly am sorry.

00:25:08.079 --> 00:25:09.720
It’s fine. Isn’t this better?

00:25:25.039 --> 00:25:25.880
Brother Meng

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.160
I never even meant to join in

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:32.039
that tea ceremony part

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.519
It was only because you weren't here

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:36.799
They

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.359
asked me

00:25:38.519 --> 00:25:40.000
to help run through it

00:25:42.039 --> 00:25:43.680
I'm not mad at you

00:25:43.799 --> 00:25:44.799
I'm mad at her

00:25:45.599 --> 00:25:46.720
All claws and fangs

00:25:46.839 --> 00:25:47.920
For no reason at all

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:52.559
She’s not usually like that

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.720
She’s normally very reasonable

00:25:55.599 --> 00:25:57.039
That’s all an act

00:25:57.119 --> 00:25:58.279
She fakes it really well

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.000
Or why else would I divorce her

00:26:00.799 --> 00:26:01.799
Wasn't it because

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:03.480
she didn’t want you anymore

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.559
No, you

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:08.160
You came all the way from Australia

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:09.759
just to gross me out, right

00:26:09.759 --> 00:26:11.039
No, no, no

00:26:13.599 --> 00:26:14.519
It seems

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:15.720
I was wrong

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.279
Actually

00:26:18.039 --> 00:26:19.400
not getting married is quite nice

00:26:21.799 --> 00:26:23.359
What business are you in, brother

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.000
I’m not in business

00:26:26.599 --> 00:26:27.839
These are my old

00:26:28.279 --> 00:26:29.079
buddies and brothers

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:30.880
We started a band

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.400
We want to put out an album

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:36.920
Hello, hello

00:26:37.079 --> 00:26:37.759
Hello

00:26:39.079 --> 00:26:39.920
I’m so jealous

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.279
To be honest

00:26:44.359 --> 00:26:46.599
I wanted a band when I was young too

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.759
But no one around me liked it

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:51.160
Alone

00:26:51.319 --> 00:26:52.200
you just can’t keep it up

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.000
Right

00:26:56.039 --> 00:26:58.119
You need like-minded people

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.960
Otherwise you really can’t play

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.559
Yes, yes

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.440
Right

00:27:02.799 --> 00:27:03.640
Right

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:04.759
Long time no see

00:27:04.759 --> 00:27:05.799
You two know each other

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.039
Come on, come on

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.440
Come on, have one, have one

00:27:09.279 --> 00:27:09.839
Have one

00:27:10.119 --> 00:27:10.599
Sing one

00:27:10.599 --> 00:27:11.000
Can’t

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:11.359
Come on

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.519
Sing one song

00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:13.880
My throat can’t do it

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.519
Singing’s not about throats, it’s fine

00:27:16.519 --> 00:27:19.079
I’m like that one

00:27:19.079 --> 00:27:20.440
I’m like a

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.519
firebird

00:27:23.519 --> 00:27:25.079
silently

00:27:25.079 --> 00:27:29.319
burning

00:27:29.599 --> 00:27:31.039
I want to sing that

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.119
You sing it great

00:27:32.119 --> 00:27:34.319
that ballad

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:35.240
Join our band

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.079
Listen, I’ll give you lead vocal

00:27:37.279 --> 00:27:38.920
Accompany me to the ends

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.000
Accompany you to the ends

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.160
of the earth

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:55.799
How’s that

00:28:02.119 --> 00:28:03.480
Li Li, open up

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.960
I’ve come to pick you up

00:28:05.839 --> 00:28:06.559
Li Li

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:08.920
Give a red envelope

00:28:12.599 --> 00:28:13.480
Li Li

00:28:14.039 --> 00:28:15.519
Take the money, Li Li

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:17.160
Li Li

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.000
Li Li

00:28:18.599 --> 00:28:19.319
Li Li

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.240
Open the door

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.720
Li Li, I truly want to marry you

00:28:27.039 --> 00:28:28.119
What if she won’t open up

00:28:29.119 --> 00:28:30.119
What else can you do

00:28:32.759 --> 00:28:33.680
Go in yourself

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.480
No need for red envelopes

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:38.240
Li Li

00:28:39.759 --> 00:28:40.359
Li Li

00:28:42.319 --> 00:28:43.079
Li Li

00:28:46.279 --> 00:28:46.839
Li Li

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:55.079
Li Li

00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.640
Li Li

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:05.880
Li Li

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:16.759
Brother-in-law

00:29:16.759 --> 00:29:17.680
No one’s inside

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.680
How important a wedding is to a woman

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.880
is way higher than it is to a man.

00:29:41.119 --> 00:29:42.359
Take me, for example.

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:45.119
Chances are I will wear a gown once in life.

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:47.640
But Meng Hang wears a suit and tie every day.

00:29:47.799 --> 00:29:49.480
So how could he value it that much?

00:29:50.279 --> 00:29:52.039
Every morning he puts on a suit

00:29:52.039 --> 00:29:53.160
and smiles at all kinds of people all day.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.160
If the last deal falls through,

00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.880
that’s just another normal day for him.

00:29:56.599 --> 00:29:57.480
If you ask me,

00:29:57.559 --> 00:29:59.200
if you want a wedding to feel sacred,

00:29:59.319 --> 00:30:00.920
both men and women should wear gowns.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:01.960
That way,

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.839
women can cherish that day all their lives,

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:06.480
and men can be nagged about it forever.
