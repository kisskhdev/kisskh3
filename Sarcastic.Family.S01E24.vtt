WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:45.451

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:17.560
There is only one truth

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:18.479
Based on my analysis

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:19.400
The person must have just left

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:20.400
How can you tell

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.360
The water in this cup

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:23.360
Is still hot

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.199
Is there a possibility

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:29.560
That this cup is called a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:30.800
Thermos cup

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:50.800
The makeup looks so gorgeous

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.280
Let me see

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.800
Are these my own eyelashes

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.319
As expected, they are not

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.520
A professional makeup artist really is different

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.439
Your face upgrade is like getting a new head

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.240
Stop following me

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.439
I need to change my wedding dress

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.439
I know

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:11.080
No

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.000
Go out

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.680
Go

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.560
Let me record this

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.840
Fine, I will not film either

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.719
Sis, I am resting here a bit, I am tired

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:23.960
Get out

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:25.240
No, I just

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.159
Cai Yi, I

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.280
Let us both take a break

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.719
Why are you resting in the bride’s room

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.520
I am exhausted

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.840
Say no more

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.840
I do not want to upset myself

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.919
At least you know yourself

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.879
You really are my own daughter

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.000
So

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:05.000
Ugly, right

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:07.960
Really

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.199
Let me see

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:17.480
Are you stupid or what

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.680
You fall for it every time

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.240
With my high IQ genes

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.920
How did none of it pass to you

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:27.319
You take after your dad in everything

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.920
Mom

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.480
My dad

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.279
My dad did not come to my wedding

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:38.480
I am actually quite regretful

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:40.319
You really do not miss him

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.360
I do not

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.199
You look exactly like your dad

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.800
Why would I miss him

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.800
Having you is enough

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.759
You can go

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.519
Okay

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.879
Got it

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.839
Are you all right

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.600
I am fine

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.319
Yes

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:16.240
Well

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.439
Li Cai

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.839
He said

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:20.519
He left this here

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:21.800
And asked me to bring it to him

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:48.399
Bottoms up

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.800
Here

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.959
Shall we down it

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.720
Down it

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.279
Done

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.920
Downed it

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.480
Down it down it

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.000
You drink first

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:56.160
I cannot finish it

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.439
It is fine if you cannot

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:59.639
Drink it slowly

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.920
Okay, let us toast together

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.160
So nice, Jin Shu

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:04.000
It is okay, it is okay

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.720
Such a good temper

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.879
Now let us rehearse the speeches

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.720
Please welcome the bride’s mother onstage

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.680
Come on

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:24.399
I

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.519
Well...

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.199
My mom's speech draft

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:29.000
is not finished yet

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.360
right?

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:31.639
Let us just run through the process today

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:32.639
and deal with it tomorrow

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:33.959
Then rehearsal is over

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.720
Okay

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.439
Turn it off

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:36.879
Sis

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.959
Tonight you and Cai Yi go home

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.120
and everyone else goes back to the hotel

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:41.639
Tomorrow morning my brother in law comes to fetch the bride

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.720
You just wait at home for us

00:06:42.959 --> 00:06:43.319
Okay

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.759
Okay

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:44.920
The arrangements are pretty clear

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:45.600
Okay

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.800
Drink a bit less

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:48.279
You have to get up early tomorrow

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.199
All right then

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:50.079
We will head back first

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.079
Rest early Mom

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:51.800
We are going

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:52.560
Go on

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:53.959
Wait for me

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:56.319
Well...

00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:57.360
Y you go back first

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:58.639
What is wrong with you

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.720
I

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:01.560
I will discuss it a bit more with Li Cai

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.680
about my speech for tomorrow

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:05.120
You are discussing it with him

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.079
He is already drinking

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.519
What can you two even come up with

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:09.560
Li Li

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:11.360
If

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.680
I mean if just in case

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.040
at tomorrow's wedding

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.759
an important guest does not come

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:17.519
will it matter a lot

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:21.439
A guest

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.800
It should be fine

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.720
As long as bride and groom are there

00:07:26.519 --> 00:07:27.439
Then I am relieved

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.560
Who who is not coming

00:07:32.959 --> 00:07:33.839
This is for you

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:35.120
Well...

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.279
After the wedding

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.000
open it

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:39.920
What is this all mysterious for

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:41.319
Come on come on let us go home

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.839
Then I am going

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:43.439
Go on go on go on

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.560
Do not stay up too late

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:28.199
Li Li

00:08:29.519 --> 00:08:30.040
If

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.439
I mean if just in case

00:08:31.879 --> 00:08:34.759
an important guest does not come to the wedding tomorrow

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:36.320
will it matter a lot

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.840
Happy birthday to you

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.720
Happy birthday to you

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.320
Happy birthday to you

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.720
I hope my daughter

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.639
is as happy every day as she is today

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.279
Ever since I was little

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.360
I have looked forward most to this moment

00:09:17.559 --> 00:09:18.919
Who allowed you to hold mine

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.720
You even slept in my bed

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.519
I even took photos

00:09:22.559 --> 00:09:23.559
I will send them to you now

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.960
So gross

00:09:25.159 --> 00:09:26.559
How do I delete this thing anyway

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:14.240
Why do you have to move it earlier

00:10:15.399 --> 00:10:16.960
Plans cannot keep up with changes

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.759
The interstellar weather report says

00:10:19.159 --> 00:10:19.879
Neptune

00:10:19.879 --> 00:10:21.120
there is in the Kuiper Belt

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.639
a meteor shower

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.159
which will affect the flight safety of the route

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:25.720
so it was moved earlier

00:10:26.279 --> 00:10:26.759
Then

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.600
then I will change to the next flight

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.360
You would have to wait for the next flight

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:32.799
five years and six months

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:34.919
and only hanging tickets are left

00:10:35.799 --> 00:10:36.600
Hanging ticket

00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:38.919
I would be outside the cabin

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:39.679
hanging there

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:41.559
crossing half the galaxy

00:10:41.759 --> 00:10:42.559
Are you kidding me

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:44.720
Mom

00:10:52.759 --> 00:10:54.399
Are you leaving tomorrow night?

00:10:55.039 --> 00:10:55.759
No.

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:56.919
Stop lying to me.

00:10:56.919 --> 00:10:58.360
I saw it all.

00:11:00.039 --> 00:11:00.480
No.

00:11:00.639 --> 00:11:02.039
I really, really am not.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:03.879
Yes.

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:05.639
Tomorrow morning.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.440
Tomorrow morning.

00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:10.679
The flight was moved earlier.

00:11:11.159 --> 00:11:12.679
I have to board at dawn.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.679
Li Li,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.240
come with me.

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:25.799
I heard some news.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.279
If aliens stay on Earth too long,

00:11:28.559 --> 00:11:29.320
they will die.

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:31.639
No kidding, you stay anywhere long enough, you die.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:33.240
I am not finished yet.

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:33.799
Let me finish.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.440
They said 3 years ago,

00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:36.799
one of our folks

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.159
mysteriously went into

00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:40.759
a rapid aging phase

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.279
and then died of

00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:43.919
multi-organ failure.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.279
No one cared at the time,

00:11:47.559 --> 00:11:48.639
not until last month,

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:51.080
when the causes of death of more aliens

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:52.320
were exposed.

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:53.159
They found out

00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:55.639
almost all were like this.

00:11:56.159 --> 00:11:57.759
Only then did everyone know the truth.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.320
We aliens come to Earth

00:11:59.320 --> 00:11:59.960
and in the end

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.559
we all end up like that.

00:12:02.879 --> 00:12:03.200
Yes.

00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:04.639
We die miserably.

00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:06.360
Bleeding from every orifice.

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:08.440
Then the heart suddenly stops.

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:10.399
Why are you telling me this?

00:12:10.399 --> 00:12:11.480
Tell her.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.240
And then just,

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:13.960
bang,

00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:15.279
they explode.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.399
They explode.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.080
You have been on Earth for decades.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.159
You have not exploded.

00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:25.360
You are just in a rush to leave, right?

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.000
Then make up a better excuse.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.600
This is way too perfunctory.

00:12:29.159 --> 00:12:31.159
E even if what I said was just hearsay,

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:31.679
then what I am

00:12:32.039 --> 00:12:33.120
about to say now

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.240
is absolutely true.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:35.720
They are going to build

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.879
an Interstellar Highway.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:37.960
Earth is in the way.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.559
It is about to be hit with dimensional reduction.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.679
Come with me.

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:41.399
Mom,

00:12:46.679 --> 00:12:48.879
do you really not want to attend my wedding?

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.960
Y your mom is worried about you.

00:12:54.039 --> 00:12:55.399
She is afraid you will be alone on Earth.

00:12:55.399 --> 00:12:56.159
You shut up.

00:12:58.799 --> 00:13:00.000
Far from home.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.080
The wedding dress is still here.

00:13:40.399 --> 00:13:41.039
Brother-in-law,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.120
the button was left behind.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.639
Left behind.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.360
This implies

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:50.840
my sister was detained.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.240
So this is a kidnapping case.

00:13:52.519 --> 00:13:54.039
Stop messing around.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.159
There is another possibility.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:13:59.720
The button

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:00.919
popped off onto the floor.

00:14:02.519 --> 00:14:04.159
That means when my sister tried on the dress,

00:14:04.159 --> 00:14:05.000
she found she had gained weight.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.279
So my sister went to lose weight.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:12.720
Right.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.240
She got fat.

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:20.919
She even threw up a few days ago.

00:14:22.039 --> 00:14:22.879
Most importantly,

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.360
her phone wallpaper

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.559
was changed to Guanyin.

00:14:27.159 --> 00:14:28.080
What does that mean?

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.120
It means she wants to drink tieguanyin tea.

00:14:29.279 --> 00:14:30.000
Shut up.

00:14:31.159 --> 00:14:32.519
Guanyin granting a child.

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:35.919
She is pregnant.

00:14:45.639 --> 00:14:45.919
Sis

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:46.799
You are pregnant

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:47.879
I am going to be an uncle

00:14:47.919 --> 00:14:48.879
Who is pregnant

00:14:48.879 --> 00:14:50.039
Am I really that fat now

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:51.679
Li Li

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:52.879
Where did you go

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.960
I, I

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.279
I went for a walk

00:14:56.919 --> 00:14:57.639
Just out for a walk

00:14:57.639 --> 00:14:58.639
I told you to lose some weight

00:14:59.039 --> 00:14:59.960
Hurry up, brother in law

00:15:00.559 --> 00:15:01.720
Right, right, there is no time

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.240
Let us go

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.799
I have not changed into my gown

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.480
I have not put on my wedding dress

00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.120
There is no time

00:15:10.639 --> 00:15:11.120
My friends

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.399
The most thrilling moment is here

00:15:13.639 --> 00:15:15.440
Please raise your golden palms

00:15:15.679 --> 00:15:16.159
Silver palms

00:15:16.519 --> 00:15:17.600
Money making palms

00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:18.720
And warmly welcome

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:19.720
The groom and the bride

00:15:20.039 --> 00:15:20.759
As they make a shining

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:21.600
Entrance

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.399
Honored guests, have you noticed

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.360
The groom

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.320
The way he looks at the bride

00:15:46.519 --> 00:15:47.679
His eyes are glowing

00:15:47.919 --> 00:15:48.600
Do you know why

00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:49.679
Because the bride

00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:50.879
Is now wrapped

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.200
In a beautiful kasaya

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.080
Wedding dress

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.480
I am a black bear demon now

00:15:57.799 --> 00:15:58.799
This loving couple

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.320
With two hearts that

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.360
Are in love with each other

00:16:01.679 --> 00:16:02.440
Are about to

00:16:02.639 --> 00:16:03.919
Step onto this wedding

00:16:04.039 --> 00:16:04.840
Of souls

00:16:04.879 --> 00:16:05.759
Colliding

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:06.519
Hall

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.720
Groom, please

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:08.720
Collide with

00:16:09.039 --> 00:16:09.600
The bride

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.879
Will the newlyweds enter the hall

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:47.639
Come on stage

00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:52.919
Who let him host this

00:16:53.559 --> 00:16:54.840
I regret it now too

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.399
Today

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.080
At this

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.000
Unforgettable moment of your lives

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.120
Everyone who loves you

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.240
Holds in their hearts a

00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:03.759
Shared wish

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.720
We wish you

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:06.559
In your happy love nest

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.880
To love each other wholeheartedly

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.920
On the journey of life

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:11.960
To walk hand in hand

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:13.319
Those two lines were not bad

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.279
You two

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:16.000
Sail on the great ship of love

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.880
Just like the Titanic

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.160
Riding the winds and waves

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:22.200
Can you wish us something better

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.680
As the saying goes

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.200
When you drink water, remember the well

00:17:30.359 --> 00:17:31.359
As the saying goes

00:17:31.599 --> 00:17:33.599
When you drink water, remember who dug the well

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.880
In happiness, do not forget

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:35.799
The kindness of your parents

00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:36.920
So next

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.200
Everyone, please pay attention

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.079
Let us solemnly invite the hosts of this wedding

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:43.920
The parents of both families to enter

00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:44.880
First, please welcome

00:17:45.079 --> 00:17:46.279
The groom parents

00:17:46.359 --> 00:17:47.519
Mr Meng Qianwan

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.160
And Ms Mu Guiying

00:17:50.599 --> 00:17:51.400
So handsome, so handsome

00:17:57.319 --> 00:17:59.680
Next, please welcome the bride mother

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.160
Ms Cai Xiaoying

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.039
Ms Cai Xiaoying

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.319
Please come on stage

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.599
Ms Cai Xiaoying

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.240
Please come on stage

00:18:22.079 --> 00:18:23.400
Everyone, put on your glasses

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.319
The antimatter engine will start soon

00:18:25.319 --> 00:18:26.160
There will be a strong flash

00:18:28.279 --> 00:18:28.759
Glasses

00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:29.759
Put them on

00:18:35.319 --> 00:18:36.359
Ms. Cai Xiaoying

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.240
Please come on stage

00:18:42.759 --> 00:18:43.480
We are short on time

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.839
Soon we will miss the spaceship

00:18:46.759 --> 00:18:47.599
Hurry, get in the car

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:49.680
Let us go

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.519
Hurry up

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.359
Ms. Cai Xiaoying

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.599
Please come on stage

00:19:13.119 --> 00:19:14.240
Ms. Cai Xiaoying

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:18.599
Thank you all for coming

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.839
My mom just told me

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.599
she has something urgent now

00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:24.440
so she cannot attend our wedding

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.000
Thank you, everyone

00:19:26.079 --> 00:19:26.680
Thank you, thank you

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.160
What, what happened

00:19:30.319 --> 00:19:31.200
My mom, she

00:19:31.359 --> 00:19:32.640
had to go away on a trip

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.799
But she should still attend

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.400
her own daughter’s wedding

00:19:36.599 --> 00:19:38.119
Why leave at such a moment

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.000
It is fine, she

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.240
it is my wedding, not hers

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.680
As long as her blessing is here

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.559
Come on, let us do the procedure

00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:47.319
Do the procedure

00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:49.480
Next, let us quickly do the procedure

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.519
The ceremony is complete

00:20:00.319 --> 00:20:00.799
Okay

00:20:03.519 --> 00:20:04.160
Okay

00:20:05.839 --> 00:20:07.000
Okay

00:20:20.559 --> 00:20:21.599
Okay, keep smiling

00:20:21.599 --> 00:20:22.079
Keep smiling

00:20:22.079 --> 00:20:22.960
Bride, move a bit to the right

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.359
Okay

00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:25.559
Okay

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.759
One two three

00:20:27.599 --> 00:20:28.440
A lifetime of harmony

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:29.359
Thank you, uncle, thank you, uncle, come on

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.599
Li Li

00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:31.359
Sis

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:32.759
Happy wedding day, happy wedding day

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.680
Congrats, bro, congrats, bro

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.640
No hard feelings, okay

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.519
Next time I will bring some seeds to your place

00:20:38.759 --> 00:20:40.079
Look at the camera, look at the camera

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.680
Three two one

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.720
Ten o clock direction

00:20:44.599 --> 00:20:46.160
That woman has something going on with Old Li

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.400
Look into it

00:20:48.599 --> 00:20:49.920
Sis, I am getting married here

00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.000
Fine

00:20:51.319 --> 00:20:52.799
Then report back to me tomorrow

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:56.839
Smile, smile

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.599
Come on, one more shot

00:20:57.599 --> 00:20:59.000
Mom, are you leaving so fast because something happened

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:00.400
I will explain it to you later

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.079
Okay

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.000
You have worked hard, really, thank you

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.640
Take good care of yourselves

00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:05.160
You must, really must, take good care

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.440
Then when will you come back

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:08.680
I am not coming back

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:09.039
Congratulations, congratulations

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:09.559
Director Li

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:10.680
Director Li

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:11.519
This is my husband

00:21:11.519 --> 00:21:12.519
He is really handsome and talented

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.559
Wish you both happiness

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:14.720
Come on, come on

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.279
One two three

00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.160
Okay

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:16.799
Congrats

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.480
Congrats, congrats

00:21:17.559 --> 00:21:18.839
How can you just leave like that

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.160
It is too sudden

00:21:21.039 --> 00:21:22.759
You did not even give me a heads up

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.039
Meng Hang

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:28.240
Meng Hang

00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:30.400
I have to say a few words to you

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:32.400
Usually

00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.200
Go to bed early and get up early

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.079
Stop always eating late night snacks

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.119
If you die young

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.440
Li Li will end up a widow

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:42.400
You should also talk to Li Li

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.400
Tell her not to work overtime all night

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.559
Those mistresses around her boss

00:21:46.559 --> 00:21:47.759
You can never catch them all

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.039
Her own health matters more

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:51.960
Spend more time with Li Li

00:21:52.519 --> 00:21:54.640
Do not always go boxing alone

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.079
I know

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.720
You want to beat up the manager

00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.319
And that little Cha

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.599
Just tell me about it

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.519
I have a hundred ways to make them suffer

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.920
If you get hurt

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:08.000
Our Li Li

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.480
Will have to go to the hospital to take care of you

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.480
Make her laugh more

00:22:16.039 --> 00:22:17.599
I always say she is not pretty

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.279
But actually

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.359
She is beautiful when she smiles

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.319
Of course, still a bit worse than me

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.079
Well, she takes after her dad

00:22:28.839 --> 00:22:29.640
Today

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.960
I give you my greatest treasure

00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:34.720
And put her in your hands

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:37.599
Meng Hang

00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:40.720
Do not mess this up on me

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.359
I miss my mom

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:30.960
Next

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:32.160
It will be brought to you by me

00:23:32.279 --> 00:23:32.920
Little Liu Qian

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.400
I will perform a magic trick for everyone

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:36.240
Appearing person illusion

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.680
When did he learn that

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.160
He arranged it himself

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:42.960
Now

00:23:43.359 --> 00:23:44.599
There is nothing inside here

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:45.559
Completely empty

00:23:45.599 --> 00:23:46.000
In a moment

00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:48.200
I will make a living person appear

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.079
Next

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.640
is the moment to witness a miracle

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.079
Everyone, together with me

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.240
count down from five

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.000
Five

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.000
Four

00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.240
Three

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.200
Two

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.119
One

00:24:00.279 --> 00:24:01.119
Appearing Person Illusion

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:01.799
Applause

00:24:09.279 --> 00:24:09.799
There is none

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.720
What is going on

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.839
There is no one

00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:14.400
Jin Jin Shu, come out

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.319
Where is he

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.519
Jin Shu

00:24:18.839 --> 00:24:20.160
Where is he, the trick is busted

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:20.880
Hurry and come out

00:24:22.039 --> 00:24:23.519
Uncle, where are you

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.640
What is going on

00:24:26.599 --> 00:24:29.200
You cannot get in from behind the box at all

00:24:29.839 --> 00:24:30.920
Darn

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:33.839
What kind of prop is this

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.200
This

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.640
We will pause the magic trick for now

00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:43.279
Next, Uncle Meng's Naked Mole Rat Band

00:24:43.359 --> 00:24:44.680
will bring you a song

00:24:52.799 --> 00:24:53.640
What is that glowing

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:08.839
Mom

00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:09.519
Mom

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.640
Mom is pranking us

00:25:23.839 --> 00:25:26.119
She wants to surprise us, that is a good idea

00:25:29.599 --> 00:25:30.400
Today

00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:34.839
the groom's moms and dads are all gathered here

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.319
Bride

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.039
you also have a mother

00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:39.759
I am right here

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:51.000
Here

00:25:51.119 --> 00:25:52.240
is the time to witness

00:25:52.279 --> 00:25:53.960
the moment of a miracle

00:25:54.519 --> 00:25:55.960
Okay

00:25:56.839 --> 00:25:57.599
Okay

00:26:17.799 --> 00:26:18.799
I want to get off

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.000
Do not make trouble, auntie, what kind of joke is this

00:26:22.759 --> 00:26:23.759
I am serious

00:26:23.839 --> 00:26:24.759
Send me back

00:26:26.079 --> 00:26:27.519
Why do you want to get off

00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:35.200
Have you ever had someone you could not stop worrying about

00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:37.240
That person

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.599
Sometimes keeps you awake at night

00:26:40.119 --> 00:26:41.519
And sometimes lets you sleep so soundly

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:43.279
Makes you

00:26:43.359 --> 00:26:44.960
Feel very fragile at times

00:26:45.279 --> 00:26:47.480
But also makes you feel so strong

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.799
Allergic to hugs

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.519
Mom

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.279
What are you doing

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:54.720
I am sorry

00:26:54.799 --> 00:26:56.079
You will think a hundred times

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.799
Of kicking them to the ends of the earth

00:26:59.119 --> 00:26:59.680
Cai Yi

00:26:59.799 --> 00:27:00.519
What is going on

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:01.559
He even knelt down and begged me

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:03.400
And for the hundred and first time

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.599
You want to keep them by your side

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:07.079
Humans

00:27:07.799 --> 00:27:08.559
Ignorant

00:27:08.799 --> 00:27:09.920
Fragile

00:27:10.319 --> 00:27:11.359
Short lived

00:27:11.519 --> 00:27:12.559
Childish

00:27:13.079 --> 00:27:16.079
But they have a deadly weapon

00:27:17.359 --> 00:27:18.880
And that is love

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.039
Dad

00:27:20.039 --> 00:27:21.960
Come quick Meng Hang has killed himself

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:23.759
Call him one more time

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.440
Do you dare to answer

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:26.119
Dad

00:27:27.079 --> 00:27:27.720
Dad

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.000
In this lifetime of ours

00:27:29.119 --> 00:27:31.079
The number of times you call me is already fixed

00:27:31.119 --> 00:27:32.759
Each time you shout it there is one less left

00:27:32.759 --> 00:27:33.519
Stop right there

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.400
You stop right there

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.640
You damn pervert

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.440
Sis

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:37.799
I miss you

00:27:39.279 --> 00:27:39.640
Fine

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:40.640
Okay

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.200
Not until today

00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:43.920
Did I finally realize

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.519
That it is exactly because you are so weird

00:27:45.839 --> 00:27:46.799
That in my eyes

00:27:47.079 --> 00:27:48.759
You are the most precious kind of adorable

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.200
This word is very violent

00:27:52.839 --> 00:27:54.039
It pulls me in

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.000
Drags me along

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.480
That gravity

00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.359
Is stronger than a black hole

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.160
This is forty three not forty eight

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:01.799
Look

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.960
Dad what is wrong with you

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.319
Son call the police

00:28:06.119 --> 00:28:06.839
I will propose one toast

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.240
Let us all drink to my in law

00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.559
You have just arrived on Earth

00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:11.799
I am your local guide

00:28:12.119 --> 00:28:12.759
Starting today

00:28:12.799 --> 00:28:14.039
I will be with you all the way to

00:28:14.079 --> 00:28:15.000
Your old age and your final farewell

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.119
Today Meng Hang and I

00:28:17.359 --> 00:28:18.440
Put on these outfits

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.680
Turn heads

00:28:19.759 --> 00:28:20.720
Like crazy

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:21.920
That day

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.880
My dad said he would take me away

00:28:24.079 --> 00:28:25.039
But

00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.960
When we were about to board the spaceship

00:28:27.359 --> 00:28:29.200
I suddenly thought of my mom

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.720
Mom

00:28:31.359 --> 00:28:33.160
If I leave today

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.720
There is one thing I am afraid of

00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:39.480
After I return to my home planet

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.960
When I look up at the stars

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.680
Every single night

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.279
I will keep thinking

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.319
Of using the rest of my life

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.079
To trade for one more chance

00:28:50.559 --> 00:28:52.039
This very moment right now

00:28:52.039 --> 00:28:53.279
To let this car

00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:54.759
Stop right here

00:29:07.759 --> 00:29:09.640
How could I say something so cheesy

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:10.279
Pfui, pfui, pfui

00:29:10.599 --> 00:29:11.160
Pfui, pfui

00:29:11.359 --> 00:29:12.160
It is not cheesy

00:29:12.799 --> 00:29:13.680
It is really sentimental

00:29:14.359 --> 00:29:16.119
I have hated sentimentality my whole life

00:29:16.759 --> 00:29:17.640
You, hate sentimentality

00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:19.119
On the Spring Festival Gala you were the most sentimental

00:29:19.119 --> 00:29:20.720
You still, you still claim you hate sentimentality

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:22.279
That, that was

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.960
the me from a parallel universe

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.720
That is not even the same person

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.359
Right

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:29.440
All right

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:30.319
You all go

00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:32.119
I am staying

00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:34.039
I am not leaving either

00:29:34.519 --> 00:29:35.519
I want to stay on Earth too

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:38.880
I cannot part with my deskmate

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:41.680
I will be with Gang Dan even if it kills me

00:29:42.519 --> 00:29:43.640
Wherever my beloved is

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:44.839
that is where home is

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:45.839
Right

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:46.519
Go home

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:47.680
Yes

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.319
Go home, go home

00:29:49.519 --> 00:29:49.920
Go home

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:51.759
Go

00:29:52.079 --> 00:29:52.759
Go home

00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.640
I did not close my windows at home

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.440
Mother in law, you look so beautiful

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.880
Congratulations, congratulations, congratulations

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.680
Congratulations, congratulations

00:30:15.799 --> 00:30:16.960
Thank you, same to you

00:30:18.319 --> 00:30:19.440
Why are you not leaving anymore

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:22.440
Well

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.000
The flight suddenly went up in price

00:30:24.319 --> 00:30:26.319
I am not going to be that sucker

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.279
Did you not say

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.119
that Earth is about to be forcibly demolished

00:30:30.279 --> 00:30:30.880
Yeah

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:31.920
Then it is perfect for me

00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:32.960
I will be a holdout

00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:34.519
and squeeze a huge payout from it

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.440
I mean

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:42.559
give me back the money I gave you

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:46.119
I am allergic

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:46.519
I

00:30:46.799 --> 00:30:47.240
I

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.640
Happy wedding

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.799
Even though my mom still will not admit it

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:45.799
I know

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:46.920
she has already fully

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.480
accepted this big family

00:31:48.599 --> 00:31:49.400
And also

00:31:49.559 --> 00:31:50.440
the name of our group chat

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.559
was finally changed by her

00:32:14.519 --> 00:32:16.160
Okay, on this very special day

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.640
I want to give my blessings to our employee Li Li

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.759
And also to Meng Hang

00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:20.400
I wish you two

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:23.039
a happy marriage and a long life together

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:24.720
Oh right, Little Meng

00:32:25.319 --> 00:32:26.400
here is a friendly reminder

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:29.200
our Li Li has had professional training

00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:31.599
and I have the Heavenly Eye System in my hand

00:32:32.079 --> 00:32:33.880
so you had better never do anything to betray her

00:32:34.279 --> 00:32:35.200
got it?

00:32:35.799 --> 00:32:36.440
Here

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.680
I wish Li Li and Little Meng a happy marriage

00:32:39.319 --> 00:32:40.519
Speaking as the boss

00:32:40.519 --> 00:32:42.640
I would rather give you a few days of wedding leave

00:32:42.920 --> 00:32:44.279
because that way

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.559
it is like giving myself a vacation too

00:32:47.759 --> 00:32:48.680
Sister Li

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.119
I heard you are getting married

00:32:51.599 --> 00:32:52.680
you said you would find me

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.079
a guy even more handsome than Peng Yuyan

00:32:55.079 --> 00:32:56.440
when are you arranging that for me

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.720
I am here waiting for your good news

00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.559
Love you

00:33:00.519 --> 00:33:01.039
Li Li

00:33:01.119 --> 00:33:02.480
happy wedding

00:33:02.519 --> 00:33:04.519
remember to give me the bouquet

00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.519
Li Li, Little Meng

00:33:06.599 --> 00:33:08.240
I wish you a happy marriage

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.519
After you get married

00:33:09.559 --> 00:33:10.960
you must be tolerant of each other

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.640
do not fuss over every little thing

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.079
I have done accounts my whole life

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.559
and I have never miscalculated

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.799
only this messy account of feelings

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.119
I can never work it out clearly

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:19.920
Little Meng

00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:21.160
happy wedding

00:33:21.559 --> 00:33:23.559
here is another riddle for you

00:33:23.799 --> 00:33:26.359
What kind of house has no shared area

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:27.880
The answer is

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.279
the chambers of your heart

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.759
The chambers of your heart

00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:32.920
must all belong to Li Li

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.519
In the past

00:33:34.759 --> 00:33:36.400
I was really against getting married

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.200
but after seeing Little Meng and Li Li

00:33:39.319 --> 00:33:40.680
I suddenly understood

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.960
what it means

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:44.440
to envy lovers, not immortals

00:33:47.599 --> 00:33:48.279
I will stop talking

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.279
I will go try proposing too

00:33:53.559 --> 00:33:54.519
Do you

00:33:55.519 --> 00:33:57.119
want to

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:01.119
marry me

00:34:03.799 --> 00:34:04.599
Group message sent successfully

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.240
On my big screen

00:34:08.039 --> 00:34:09.559
I can now see the two newlyweds

00:34:09.559 --> 00:34:11.599
one of them is a black hole

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.159
and the other is also a black hole

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:16.119
Two black holes slowly draw near and collide

00:34:16.239 --> 00:34:18.400
releasing gravitational waves of love across the universe

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.239
then have a little superman to keep working for me

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:22.760
I wish Sister Li Li a happy wedding

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.519
may you be united for a hundred years and have a baby soon

00:34:26.079 --> 00:34:26.719
Um

00:34:27.079 --> 00:34:28.360
who is the best man

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:29.440
send that

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.760
contact info to me

00:34:33.039 --> 00:34:34.039
sorry to trouble you
