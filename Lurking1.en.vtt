WEBVTT

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.400
Do you want me

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.800
to take your clothes off

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:15.400
or you take them off yourself?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.839
Whatever.

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.359
I'll consider it a dog bite.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.960
Your mouth is tough,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.640
but your body is soft.

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:33.719
Welcome to Tai City.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.880
Let me go!

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.840
Scoundrel!

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.920
Off course.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.640
Recalculating route for you.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:44.840
Nian?

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.000
The address is wrong.

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:47.679
- Are you sure the person...
- You've entered Tai City.

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:48.359
Come back.

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:49.399
Don't go near Tai City.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.439
Sir?

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:36.719
(There is still a pulse.)

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.680
No wounds?

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.280
Isn't this blood his?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.840
What were you doing?

00:01:55.519 --> 00:01:56.000
Let me go.

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:42.479
We found K

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.759
and a woman.

00:02:54.886 --> 00:02:58.240
=Love Lurking=

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.744
=Episode 1=

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.919
If K refuses to say anything,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.360
just kill him.

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:08.560
Leave me alone.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:13.319
You smell so good.

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.919
This is the pulmonary artery.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.159
Press it if you want to live.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.840
She's there.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.400
Let me go.

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:10.400
Shut up.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.280
Stop moving, or I'll kill you.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.759
Have you found that woman?

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.040
No. And you?

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.360
I haven't, either.

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:25.000
Shall we go inside and look?

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.720
K's body is still inside.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.720
Don't look for trouble.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.839
Let's look elsewhere first.

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:32.279
Let's go.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.000
You guys look in K's room.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.839
K ran away.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.439
Who exactly are you?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.439
And who are you?

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.319
Speak.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.199
I drove by and saved you.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.000
And then they took me here.

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:12.279
You saved me?

00:05:13.079 --> 00:05:14.199
Or you tried to kill me?

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.560
You were having a traumatic pneumothorax
at that time.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.319
If I hadn't done that, you'd have died.

00:05:22.399 --> 00:05:23.600
I remember the way in.

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:26.120
Let me go and I'll take you out.

00:05:37.792 --> 00:05:38.816
They're drug dealers.

00:05:39.584 --> 00:05:40.920
Stay with me if you want to live.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.279
Drug dealers?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.639
They are here!

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:50.639
Hurry!

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:04.480
Search!

00:06:08.384 --> 00:06:08.960
No one here.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.680
No one.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.480
Let's go.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.319
To another room.

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:11.639
Okay.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:45.519
Stay here.

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:07.920
A-Are you okay?

00:07:08.399 --> 00:07:09.199
Hurry and go.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.519
Go!

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:20.439
Nobody move.

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.879
Put down your guns.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.279
Yes, K.

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:44.560
Impressive,

00:07:45.199 --> 00:07:45.720
K.

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:47.920
You handled so many people alone.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.680
You're late.

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:52.680
If I hadn't helped handle

00:07:53.279 --> 00:07:54.279
the people outside,

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.519
do you think

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:56.839
you could still be alive?

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:01.040
If I hadn't deliberately
let them catch me,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.879
could you retrieve that batch?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.439
Daring to steal our goods?

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.360
Idiots.

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:20.079
Get rid of everyone here.

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:21.560
Yes, Kun.

00:08:27.319 --> 00:08:28.439
This chick is not bad.

00:08:29.759 --> 00:08:31.040
I found your work ID

00:08:31.519 --> 00:08:32.519
in the car outside.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:34.960
Gu Nian?

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.720
From the international medical team?

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.279
It seems keeping you is trouble.

00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:40.759
I planned to keep you for fun.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:41.960
Kill her.

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:45.360
Wait.

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:51.120
I-I saved you.

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:54.480
You saved the wrong person.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.759
He is a drug dealer.

00:08:59.519 --> 00:09:01.000
Since you brought her back,

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:02.320
you do it.

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:05.000
No.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.279
I am a doctor.

00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:08.360
Keeping me is useful to you.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
No? Then I will do it.
