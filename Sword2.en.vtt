Fafa

was kidnapped by Whiteboard years ago.

00:01:43.142 --> 00:01:44.502
We can run an investigation

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.288
and see if there are any old reports

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:47.955
that suit Fafa's case.

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:04.390
Why are you sitting on the ground?

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.520
Isn't it cold?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.640
I brought you a small gift.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.150
Here you go.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.040
Is this your bear?

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.510
I brought it back for you.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.760
Check and see if it's yours.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.230
You treasure this bear so much.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.830
Who gave it to you?

00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:50.360
Let me examine your wound.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.110
I have everything

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.830
in the pockets of my treasure box.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.150
Look.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.840
Let me put it on you.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.270
The pain will go away immediately.

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.990
There are also cartoons on it.

Do you want to try my magic?

00:04:17.733 --> 00:04:18.880
It doesn't hurt anymore.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.910
You must listen to me next time.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.470
If you don't listen to me,

00:04:23.577 --> 00:04:24.680
your stomach will hurt.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.390
Relax.

If your father is a bad person,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.910
the police will catch him.

Speak.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.950
Apparently, Whiteboard

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:24.880
is a gambling addict.

00:05:25.222 --> 00:05:26.560
He usually gambles at places

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.830
with games hosted by dealers.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:31.760

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.200
Take a look.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.555
Which games do you want to play?

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.030
I'll do this.

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:51.220
We're playing Three Cards today.

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:53.220
Xie is here.

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.080
Quick!

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:55.350
Shuffle the cards!

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.220
Xie is here.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.680
How much are we playing for?

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.270
2,000 yuan maximum.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.710
That's a false win!

Hello, Anti-abduction Office.

00:06:20.744 --> 00:06:22.711
Yan Lei, Whiteboard
is a gambling addict.

00:06:22.888 --> 00:06:24.569
Investigate the entertainment cities

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:26.070
- Jiajia.
- and underground casinos.

00:06:26.151 --> 00:06:27.521
Don't miss out on any clues.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.960
Understood.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.950
Also, contact Chang Rui

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.240
and convey the news to him.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.950
Ask him to investigate the casino lead.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.150
Yes.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.590
Make a record.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.155
Hello, Anti-abduction Office.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.710
Lei.

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:43.680
I found it.

00:06:43.933 --> 00:06:45.244
Whiteboard is a gambling addict.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:47.240
I'm currently following this lead now.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.000
Rui,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.270
Director just called us.

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.680
She said something similar to you

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.270
and asked us to investigate
casinos and entertainment cities.

00:06:56.822 --> 00:06:59.022
Not only do I know
that Whiteboard is a gambling addict,

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:00.640
but I also know which casino he's at.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:02.040
Let me scout ahead first.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.120
Sure.

00:07:05.266 --> 00:07:07.030
Are these two competing with each other?

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.270
Seems like it.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.600
Hello. Who is it?

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.510
If you're awake,

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.350
come and play.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.110
A game hosted by Xie.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.030
Which Xie?

00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.000
The guy who's been playing generously.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.080
He's hosting a game on the hills.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.750
I'm not going.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.590
I'm poor.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.080
More reason to come.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.910
I'm telling you.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.360
This is a great opportunity.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.390
If you gamble today,

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.911
there are no limits to your winnings.

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.000
Don't blame me for not notifying you.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.030
Sure.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:13.390
Big!

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.240
Small!

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:32.960
Open!

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.040
Odd or even?

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:34.890
Even!

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:37.770
- Odd!
- Even!

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:39.480
Even!

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:40.550
There's no mistake!

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.360
Five.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.320
Ten.

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:43.630
11, odd.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:47.990
Thank you!

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.960
Buy!

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.080
Buy!

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.710
Even!

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.280
Even again!

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.110
Odd again!

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.080
Even!

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.520
Odd!

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:18.630
Two.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:19.950
Four.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.390
Six.

00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.320
Eight.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:23.830
Nine, odd.

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.470
This doesn't count!

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.630
Dafeng.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.830
Show some respect.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.400
Respect is worth nothing.

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:42.440
Besides, why should I show you respect?

00:09:48.555 --> 00:09:49.560
If you like, keep playing.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.630
Otherwise, get lost.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.120
Who are you?

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.280
Feng,

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.320
he is Xie.

00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:57.230
Let's not offend him.

00:09:58.733 --> 00:10:00.710
You spend money
on food, wine and entertainment.

00:10:00.777 --> 00:10:03.311
Gambling is the only thing
that lets you spend and make money.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.750
We are all here just for fun.

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:09.800
Don't spoil the rules.

00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:12.111
I'll pay for your losses
in the previous game.

00:10:13.422 --> 00:10:15.400
Give the money back to that person.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:25.790
This money...

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:26.630
Feng.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.870
He is rich

00:10:27.933 --> 00:10:29.288
and he has a powerful background.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.630
Thank you, Xie!

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:36.200
Bring the chair.

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:39.440
Come on!

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.320
Keep playing!

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.560
Come on!

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.110
Place your bets!

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.200
Odd!

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:04.040
Sit.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.080
Let me introduce myself.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:11.680
I am Xie.

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:13.080
I just came to Linshan

00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:14.990
and I want to do some business here.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.360
I was the one

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.466
who hosted the game today

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:20.000
because I wanted

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:20.840
to make some friends.

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.280
We are all out here

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.280
to make money.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.320
But have you two thought about this?

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.870
Why do some people make money,

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.320
and even a lot of money,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.040
but some people

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.710
only work all day

00:11:45.777 --> 00:11:47.377
just to lose everything?

00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:57.080
You cheated?

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.000
This is the money

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.280
both of you lost here tonight.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.040
I added some money

00:12:04.111 --> 00:12:05.230
to make it a round number.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.280
What do you think?

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:11.520
Can we be friends?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:17.870
I am Bai.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:19.590
I am Zhao Dafeng.

00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:20.750
My nickname is Crazy.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:22.510
Bai.

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:24.710
Zhao.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:27.590
In my experience,

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:29.200
making money

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.200
is not about one's ability

00:12:31.822 --> 00:12:33.688
but who one partners with sometimes.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.350
I hope you can help me.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.920
Let's make it big

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.990
in Linshan

00:12:41.422 --> 00:12:42.590
and make money together.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.580
(Banker Wins)

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:49.080
Vice Director Yin,

00:12:49.688 --> 00:12:51.311
I notice someone else
besides Whiteboard.

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:53.440
He also has a partner
called Zhao Dafeng.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.510
Zhao Dafeng?

00:12:55.666 --> 00:12:57.110
I've never heard of this person.

00:12:57.155 --> 00:12:58.577
I think they are working together.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.630
I suspect they are
an organized kidnapping group.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:02.800
I want to extend the line.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.440
The priority now

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.990
is to find Zhou Min
and Zheng Weiwei immediately.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:09.990
I understand.

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:11.440
I've spread the news.

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:13.022
There will be updates soon.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.110
Director Deng.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:26.710
Chang Rui called

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.160
and said he has found Whiteboard.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.950
He also noticed another person

00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:32.160
called Zhao Dafeng.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:33.790
Zhao Dafeng?

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:34.630
There might be

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.440
a bigger target behind them,

00:13:36.688 --> 00:13:38.800
so he is not in a rush
to make the arrest right now.

00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:40.390
I asked him

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:41.630
to search for

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.155
Zhou Min and Zheng Weiwei soon.

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.710
All right. I understand.

00:13:45.133 --> 00:13:46.422
I'll report to Captain Han later.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.320
All right.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.110
Zhao Dafeng...

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:58.460
(June 18, 2009,
Linshan City Forest Park)

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.630
All right.

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:06.630
Be good.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:07.590
What a good boy.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.110
Someone! Come quickly!

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.720
Are there any doctors around?

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.150
Call 120!

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.680
Help me call 120!

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.800
Hello, emergency services?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.160
Someone has passed out here.

00:14:23.733 --> 00:14:25.288
Hello, Anti-abduction Office.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:31.990
All right. I'll head over immediately.

00:14:35.244 --> 00:14:36.439
Director, I received a report.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.080
A baby boy is missing at the Central
Garden Square in Xinmin Street.

00:14:39.088 --> 00:14:40.280
We need to deploy immediately.

00:14:42.533 --> 00:14:43.977
Ai Xin, stay here.

00:14:43.977 --> 00:14:44.439
All right.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.700
How long has the baby been missing?

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.420
Less than an hour.

00:14:46.422 --> 00:14:48.670
(Linshan City Police Station)
Contact the Command Center.

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:50.990
(A child is missing
at the Central Garden on Xinmin Street.)

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.750
(Activate Blue Contingency Plan now.)

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.470
(1201. This is 1101.)

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:55.870
I have activated

00:14:55.911 --> 00:14:58.266
the Blue Contingency Plan
to search for a missing child.

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:00.710
Surrounding police forces
have been deployed.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.140
(Xinmin Street Central Garden Square)

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:05.888
Every patrol in the city
has been informed.

00:15:05.888 --> 00:15:06.990
Report your current location.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.870
Command Center,

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.680
Traffic Team 1 is on Hongyang Street.

00:15:09.888 --> 00:15:11.230
Traffic Team 3 is on Qinghe Road.

00:15:11.355 --> 00:15:13.150
Traffic Team 4 is on
Haitang Road Section 2.

00:15:13.177 --> 00:15:15.160
We are heading to the destination. Over.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:19.630
1101. This is 1201.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:20.911
We will arrive on the scene soon.

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.222
Please activate
the Level 2 Response Plan immediately.

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:25.680
1202, Level 2 Response Plan
has been activated.

00:15:25.688 --> 00:15:27.022
When you arrive on the scene,

00:15:27.044 --> 00:15:29.155
learn about the details
and report them immediately.

00:15:29.155 --> 00:15:30.040
Roger.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:36.320
Director Deng. Vice Director Yin.

00:15:36.911 --> 00:15:38.569
The time of the crime
was half an hour ago.

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.030
The child's grandmother was pushing
a stroller on their way home.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.080
She saw someone pass out...

00:15:42.088 --> 00:15:42.960
Everyone, calm down.

00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:44.150
(She was a doctor.)
I'm a doctor.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.660
(So she rushed to give first aid.)
Let me take a look.

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.590
When she went back,
the child was missing.

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:48.630
Everyone, please make way.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.840
Please make way.

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.080
Can you hear me?

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:53.840
I checked her.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.680
She's unconscious.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.680
Where's my grandson?

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:08.040
Where's Little Spud?

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.120
Did anyone see him?

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.080
A boy.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.590
Did you see him?

00:16:12.666 --> 00:16:13.400
Call the police.

00:16:13.422 --> 00:16:14.177
Call the police.

00:16:14.222 --> 00:16:15.110
Little Spud!

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.990
Little Spud!

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.550
Everyone was focused

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.030
on the first aid

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.600
and no one saw any suspicious person.

00:16:21.866 --> 00:16:23.550
The child's grandmother is very anxious.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:24.830
She can't even speak clearly now.

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:29.630
Jiajia, check the cameras.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.030
Yes.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.670
Lei,

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:31.990
comfort the family members

00:16:32.155 --> 00:16:33.350
and find out about the child.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:34.510
You must

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:36.066
seize the critical first three hours.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:36.920
Make haste.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:44.230
Mrs. Lin.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.320
Yan...

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:49.750
Yan.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.680
I lost my grandson.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.470
Mrs. Lin.

00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:59.750
Yan.

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:00.990
You are a police officer.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.040
You must help me.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.190
I watched you grow up.

00:17:05.550 --> 00:17:07.640
You must help me find my grandson.

00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.680
I beg you.

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:09.350
Please.

00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:10.480
Don't do this.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:11.440
We are here

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.110
to help you find your grandson.

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.800
Do you know her?

00:17:14.911 --> 00:17:16.088
She is my mother's colleague.

00:17:17.022 --> 00:17:18.150
I'll leave her to you, then.

00:17:21.266 --> 00:17:22.511
Keep a close eye on her.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.280
Calm down, Mrs. Lin.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.960
Tell me about your grandson.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.430
My grandson is Lin Yangyu.

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.070
He was born

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.960
on the 21st of January, 2009.

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:37.280
Have you searched the surroundings?

00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:38.659
Our colleagues and patrol officers

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.700
have searched the garden
and the surrounding areas.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.420
Have you informed
the other family members?

00:17:42.422 --> 00:17:43.311
I have.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.950
Yan.

00:17:46.550 --> 00:17:48.190
You'll surely find the child, right?

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.480
You'll find him today.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.150
You'll surely find him, right?

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.150
Don't worry.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.590
We'll do our best.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.280
Mom!

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.210
- Mom! Where's Little Spud?
- What happened?

00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:01.480
Little Spud couldn't even walk!

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.350
How did he go missing?

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.240
What happened?

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.800
Sorry!

00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.110
Sorry!

00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:07.430
Are they police officers?

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.350
Why are you all standing here?

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:11.880
Go and find the child!

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.510
Madam,

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:15.270
we are searching the safety
and traffic cameras around the area

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.970
to find any suspicious vehicles
and people.

00:18:16.977 --> 00:18:19.040
(Calm down. We will do our best.)

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:21.580
(Central Garden)

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:29.129
(Central Garden)

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:30.400
Which department do you come from?

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.640
We are from Anti-abduction Office.

00:18:31.644 --> 00:18:32.920
Don't worry. We'll find the child.

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.680
I don't care where you come from!

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.070
Don't just stand here!

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:37.110
Go find the child!

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.680
Find him!

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.260
Easy. We are doing
our best to investigate.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.300
Please cooperate with us
and give us your testimony

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.760
so we can get more information, okay?

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.040
Let's go.

00:18:44.066 --> 00:18:44.480
Yan Lei.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.160
Let's go, hurry!

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:45.560
This way.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.520
Let's go.

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.720
Mom!

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.910
Director Deng.

00:19:01.133 --> 00:19:02.933
Is this your first time
coming to the scene?

00:19:06.755 --> 00:19:08.800
This usually happens
for Anti-kidnapping officers.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.520
We understand
how the family members feel.

00:19:12.222 --> 00:19:13.422
However, there's no choice.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.280
Many things usually happen at once.

00:19:16.711 --> 00:19:18.040
It's easy to charge into battle,

00:19:18.066 --> 00:19:20.911
but it's difficult to communicate
with the family members of a victim.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:25.729
Director Deng. Vice Director Yin.

00:19:25.730 --> 00:19:27.200
I've connected
with Command Center.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.244
They are also investigating.

00:19:28.447 --> 00:19:30.200
I've confirmed the situation.

00:19:30.266 --> 00:19:32.680
It happened suddenly and everyone
wanted to save that person.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.355
So, no one paid attention to the child.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.888
Did you check the parents' background?

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.800
I did.

00:19:36.866 --> 00:19:37.960
They have simple backgrounds

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.080
with no enemies.

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.960
Director, look.

00:19:44.533 --> 00:19:46.350
This vehicle had been
parked at a blind spot

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.900
since it entered the garden.

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:50.180
(Central Garden)
Check when the car left the garden.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:57.940
(Central Garden)

00:20:00.888 --> 00:20:02.690
It was when Dr. Lin
was rescuing the patient.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:04.390
Zoom in on the plate.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:12.000
South C C0Y30.

00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:14.280
This model.

00:20:15.933 --> 00:20:17.333
Check the license plates.

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.270
The plate is registered to a sedan

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.200
and not an SUV.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.329
This is a fake license plate.

00:20:22.330 --> 00:20:24.070
We'll go after the car
while investigating.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:26.720
Command Center.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.110
We've found the suspect vehicle.

00:20:28.244 --> 00:20:28.880
License Plate.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.870
South C C0Y30.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.540
(Heading towards Longshan West Road)

00:20:36.550 --> 00:20:38.550
The suspect vehicle is now on
Longshan West Road.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.777
It is driving out of the city.

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:42.110
Deploy all patrol vehicles
around Longshan Road.

00:20:42.481 --> 00:20:43.321
Longshan West Road?

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.000
(Linshan PGIS Application Platform)

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.844
This vehicle
has been driving on rural roads

00:20:46.888 --> 00:20:48.110
to avoid our checkpoints.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:49.155
This must be our target.

00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.800
South C C0Y30!

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.910
Pull over!

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:08.190
C0Y30!

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:08.920
Pull over!

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.870
Why are the police here?

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.440
Shu.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.000
Can you stop him from crying?

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:15.430
The car in front.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.560
C0Y30! Pull over!

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.800
Stop!

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.644
The suspect vehicle
is heading towards Huajie Road.

00:21:33.644 --> 00:21:35.520
All patrol vehicles,
intercept it immediately.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:43.800
That's the suspect vehicle.

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.040
Director,

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.800
Command Center has sent us a map.

00:22:53.355 --> 00:22:55.222
Director, there's a
three-way fork ahead.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.490
We'll turn right and corner it.

00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:57.430
All right.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.480
Chang Rui.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.550
Follow the suspect vehicle.

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:00.820
We'll corner it from another road.

00:23:00.822 --> 00:23:01.600
Yes.

00:23:19.133 --> 00:23:20.640
Director, we can intercept the vehicle

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.577
at the junction ahead.

00:23:24.266 --> 00:23:26.644
Get every department
to follow the suspect vehicle closely.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.760
800 metres to the suspect vehicle.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.760
600 metres.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.910
400 metres.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.560
200 metres.

00:23:48.458 --> 00:23:49.298
Last 100 metres.

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:52.190
20 metres.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:05.590
Turn off the vehicle!

00:24:06.262 --> 00:24:07.582
Get out! Hurry!

00:24:10.110 --> 00:24:10.950
Get out!

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:19.350
Whose child is this?

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:20.760
This...

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.150
This is my child.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.080
Take them away.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:28.660
(June 18, 2009, Thursday)

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.350
Officers,

00:24:33.212 --> 00:24:35.292
I didn't commit any crime.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.480
Why did you run then?

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:44.800
I had

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.520
some smuggled cigarettes in the car.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.280
Also,

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.320
that vehicle used a fake license plate.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.000
I didn't expect all of you

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.790
to pursue me for so long
just for that matter.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:57.320
I was very afraid,

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.280
so I...

00:24:58.960 --> 00:24:59.800
I escaped.

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:01.910
The cigarettes in your car

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.910
and the false plate on your car

00:25:04.311 --> 00:25:05.670
aren't the most important things.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.480
Most importantly,

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:08.630
why is the child

00:25:08.666 --> 00:25:09.760
in your car?

00:25:10.456 --> 00:25:11.333
The child?

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.240
What's wrong with my child?

00:25:38.030 --> 00:25:38.910
Officers!

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:40.430
Where's our child?

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:43.590
The child

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.240
isn't yours.

00:25:47.222 --> 00:25:47.960
That's impossible.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.888
Have you confirmed it?

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.080
I have.

00:25:50.287 --> 00:25:51.331
That's impossible.

00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:53.240
Did you make a mistake?

00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:55.350
Can you let us take a look?

00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:56.400
We want to confirm it.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:56.790
Yes.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:57.790
I beg you.

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.440
Let us take a look.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.510
Can you let us confirm it?

00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:02.520
I beg you.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:03.270
I beg you!

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.110
Mrs. Lin,

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:05.240
please calm down.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:06.790
The DNA test result

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:07.750
is out.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:08.590
The child

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.110
isn't yours.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.280
Mom...

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:16.960
What were you doing?

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.800
Mom!

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:19.720
Little Spud is a baby!

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:21.110
He couldn't speak

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:22.110
or walk!

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.080
How can we find him?

00:26:25.177 --> 00:26:26.600
- Sorry.
- The police will help us.

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.720
Sorry!

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:29.350
- It's all my fault!
- We are here.

00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.510
It's all my fault!

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:32.390
Calm down.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.590
Go out and find him!

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:36.670
Shut up!

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:37.840
Officer!

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:38.790
Sorry!

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:40.080
His attitude was bad!

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.070
- I apologize to you!
- Get up!

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.790
Officer!

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:43.720
Stand up first.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.200
He can't live anymore
if he cannot be found!

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.510
I understand how you feel.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:48.270
Stand up first.

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:50.350
Officers,
we'll surely cooperate with you.

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.933
We understand.

00:26:50.955 --> 00:26:52.370
- Please stand up.
- Let's talk.

00:26:52.377 --> 00:26:53.870
I don't have any other way!

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.670
This is normal
in the Anti-abduction Office.

00:26:59.111 --> 00:27:01.400
The feeling of hope
and disappointment changes constantly.

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:03.430
As time goes on,

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:04.733
you'll get used to it.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.960
Is it possible

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.910
that our search direction was wrong?

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:12.510
Is it possible

00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:14.160
that the kidnapper

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.000
did not escape in a car immediately

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.350
and chose to enter the garden further

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:20.480
or somewhere without cameras?

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:21.800
Some blind spots.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:23.320
Is there such a possibility?

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.670
Why must he
go further inside the garden?

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:27.680
Moreover, the garden is big.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.150
There are cameras on all corners.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.440
In that case,

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.080
it might not be easy for him

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.590
to leave this garden.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:38.910
No.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.355
Something feels off about this.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:42.840
All right.

00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:43.520
First of all,

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.320
we need to expand the search radius.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.200
Not just the entrance,

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.550
but every exit of the garden.

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:49.549
We must also pay attention

00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:51.822
to blind spots and cameras
in deeper parts of the garden.

00:27:51.822 --> 00:27:52.866
Don't miss out on anyone.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:53.600
Secondly,

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.720
we need to visit the garden again.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.320
There might be other eyewitnesses.

00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.910
Thirdly,

00:28:00.222 --> 00:28:01.644
we can't eliminate the possibility

00:28:01.666 --> 00:28:02.870
that the child has been sold.

00:28:03.022 --> 00:28:04.688
So, we should contact
the police stations

00:28:04.688 --> 00:28:06.960
of other areas to release
a joint investigation notice.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.150
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:15.760
Director Deng.

00:28:15.777 --> 00:28:16.555
Tuanyuan Restaurant

00:28:16.577 --> 00:28:18.088
(Help Find My Daughter)
has been here for a long time.

00:28:18.111 --> 00:28:20.177
It is a residential
anti-kidnapping organization.

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:23.870
This is it.

00:28:25.350 --> 00:28:26.190
Madam Zhang.

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:28.320
Madam Zhang.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.160
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:30.960
Officer Yan.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.800
Are you busy?

00:28:32.511 --> 00:28:33.644
Let me introduce you.

00:28:33.644 --> 00:28:36.377
This is Director Deng, who has just come
to the Anti-abduction Office.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.320
Director Deng.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.320
She's Madam Zhang.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:50.800
Sit.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.080
Sit down.

00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:53.590
Sit.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.470
Madam Zhang,

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:57.510
I won't be sitting.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:59.350
I came here this time

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:00.350
to ask for your help.

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:04.580
(Baby, Come back)

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.830
This child went missing

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.480
in the garden two days ago.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.659
We checked the nearby cameras

00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:13.590
and found nothing.

00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:14.510
We hope to work

00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:15.630
with Tuanyuan Restaurant.

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.030
If you find any clues

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:17.750
about this child,

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:18.960
please contact us immediately.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:21.800
I understand.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.266
I will put it on

00:29:25.266 --> 00:29:29.190
the wall immediately
and contact all volunteers.

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:32.110
(Missing)
If I have news, I'll contact you.

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.720
All right.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.560
Thank you.

00:29:33.755 --> 00:29:35.333
Director, I'm going to answer this.

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.500
(Missing)
(Ranran!)

How are your parents?

00:30:11.333 --> 00:30:12.430
They are doing quite well.

00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:14.910
What about you? Are you doing well?

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.320
I'm doing fine.

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.000
Fine.

00:30:26.030 --> 00:30:27.320
You've become the director now.

00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:29.320
How nice.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.480
Madam Zhang,

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:36.560
I haven't forgotten

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.110
about Ranran.

Director Deng,

00:31:07.955 --> 00:31:09.280
there's news at the police station.

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.222
We have to go back now.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:11.430
Go back to work.

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.960
Madam Zhang, thank you.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:22.480
I will...

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:25.080
I will come back again.

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.540
(Missing)

I am a lawyer.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:29.670
Do you need any help?

Hello, Anti-abduction Office.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:55.870
What?

00:32:56.333 --> 00:32:58.377

is here again?

I am my client's lawyer.

I am Sun Wenhan.

This woman beside me

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.350
is...

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:16.870
I am Luo Xiaoxing.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.390
It has been 15 years

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:23.880
since my brother, Luo Xiaoyu,

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.560
was kidnapped.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.240
We put all our hopes

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.480
in you, police officers,

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:33.080
but until now,

00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:35.919
the police have yet to find

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.280
any leads about my younger brother.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:42.110
My client

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:43.350
is suspecting the police

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:45.760
of neglecting their responsibility.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:48.350
It's like this.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.070
I've read Luo Xiaoyu's case

00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:51.110
and the relevant details.

00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:52.590
The details are quite complicated.

00:33:52.936 --> 00:33:54.648
Since Luo Xiaoyu went missing,

00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:56.790
the Linshan Police Station Bureau's

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:58.520
Anti-abduction Office's officers

00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:00.830
have gone through 327 investigations

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:02.720
in 11 provincial cities.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.350
We've also questioned 760 people.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.080
Since you did so much,

00:34:07.244 --> 00:34:09.274
why haven't you found anything yet?

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:12.000
We are still investigating.

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.030
This case happened a long time ago.

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:16.244
Technology back then
was not as advanced.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.520
I've heard this many times.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:23.840
I only want to know
any clues about my younger brother.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:25.760
Where is he?

00:34:26.070 --> 00:34:27.480
Is he living well?

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.320
He...

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:33.440
I don't mind even if I have some news.

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.590
This case is very complicated indeed.

00:34:35.837 --> 00:34:36.840
We need time

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.355
for our investigation to bear fruit.

00:34:38.630 --> 00:34:40.310
Please be a little more patient...

00:34:40.630 --> 00:34:41.470

Since my younger brother went missing,

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.560
my mother committed suicide.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.960
My father and my grandparents

00:34:49.912 --> 00:34:52.102
couldn't see Xiaoyu return home.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.080
All of them are dead.

00:34:56.630 --> 00:34:59.190
I'm the only one left in the family.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:01.960
I've been waiting for 15 years.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.400
I've been searching for 15 years.

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.840

do you still want me to have?

Director Deng,

00:35:22.555 --> 00:35:24.560
you just took over
the anti-kidnapping job.

00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:26.840
I understand your profession,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.480
and you've done a lot of homework.

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:31.310
However, you are facing
a person who is alive

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.590
instead of emotionless numbers.

Victims

00:35:37.733 --> 00:35:40.040
don't want to hear
how hard you've worked.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.440
They only want results.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.840
What did you investigate

00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:46.488
and which step are you in?

00:35:47.590 --> 00:35:48.960
What possibilities are there?

If there are no results,

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.630
all of these are pointless.

They want a sliver of hope.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.670
A hope

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.400
to not give up and keep searching.

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:01.880
What we want

00:36:01.942 --> 00:36:04.422
isn't your meaningless work progress.

to give you a confirmed answer.

you can give us...

30,000 yuan usually.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.190

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.030
Leave it to me

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.870
and don't worry.

00:41:04.644 --> 00:41:05.550
How long do you need?

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:06.510
Two days.

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:09.470
All right.

00:41:09.590 --> 00:41:11.150
We'll meet here two days later.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:12.350
Okay.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:14.440
Take care,

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:15.280
Xie!

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:25.960
Are you spoiling the market?

00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:29.000
You're right.

00:41:29.150 --> 00:41:29.760
Here.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.720
Take it.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.700
(Tuanyuan Restaurant)

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.870
Are you busy?

00:41:53.888 --> 00:41:54.518
Madam Zhang.

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:55.520
Qian, you're here.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.480
I came here early in the morning,

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.520
not for something else

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:00.560
but for the

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.960
rent's matter.

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:03.800
Well...

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:05.070
Qian,

00:42:05.070 --> 00:42:06.360
I'm sorry.

00:42:06.846 --> 00:42:09.518
I'm a bit strapped right now.

00:42:09.630 --> 00:42:10.110
Well,

00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.670
I am

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:11.880
trying to think of something.

00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.822
I'll send you the money
once I've gathered it.

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.000
You need to pay the rent today.

00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:19.790
My family is still waiting for me
to feed them.

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:21.560
- Zhang.
- Madam Zhang.

00:42:23.590 --> 00:42:24.440
I have some money.

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.310
Let's pool our money.

00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:26.440
Yes. Me too.

00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.670
How much do you need?

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:28.510
No.

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.640
No.

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.710
How can you use all your money?

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:33.200
Making money is difficult for you two.

00:42:33.266 --> 00:42:35.880
This restaurant's problem
is our problem as well.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:36.480
Besides,

00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:38.840
if you hadn't brought me
to this restaurant,

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.360
I wouldn't know what to do.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.000
Take this money.

00:42:41.066 --> 00:42:41.760
Exactly, Zhang.

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.030
Without you,

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:44.480
I'm not sure where I would be now.

00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:45.320
All right.

00:42:46.070 --> 00:42:47.960
I'll take it as a loan.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.800
All right?

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:49.950
Well,

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.110
Qian.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:53.760
I gathered so much.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.670
1,100 yuan.

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:55.750
Take it for now.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.760
That's not enough.

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.088
It's too far apart, Madam Zhang.

00:42:59.155 --> 00:43:01.110
Give me a few more days.

00:43:01.110 --> 00:43:02.310
I'll come up with something.
