00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:00.300
Well...

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.610
I might have a fifty-fifty chance.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.890
What if I also lend you

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.060
this treasure?

00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:08.530
Then...

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.490
maybe...

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:10.130
Oh,

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.460
I'd have a seventy percent chance!

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:12.820
Great.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.700
In the cultivation world,

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.730
battles aren't just about power.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.220
They also rely on artifacts,

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.130
talismans,

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.250
and pills.

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:22.460
In terms of strength and techniques,

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.580
we can't compete

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:24.610
with those arrogant clan disciples.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.100
But there's one thing we have

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.370
that they don't,

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.010
unity.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.700
If our Azure Vein Society had a hundred rogue cultivators,

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:32.700
and each one

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.460
was willing to contribute a treasure,

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.820
then we'd have

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.730
a hundred treasures in our hands!

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.490
With that many treasures,

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.220
even if we're facing

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:42.700
Foundation Establishment cultivators,

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:43.530
we might

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:44.490
still stand a chance.

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:46.130
Absolutely!

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.340
I'm willing to lend my mid-grade whisk

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.060
for everyone to use.

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.420
Qingwen...

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.480
Since I brought this up,

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.420
it's only right I set the example.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:56.700
I've said before.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.250
The reason I founded the Azure Vein Society

00:13:58.390 --> 00:13:59.530
was to build a world

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.650
where all cultivators are equal.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:02.700
We'll show those clan kids

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.060
that rogue cultivators like us

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:05.420
are no less than any of them!

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:06.060
Yes!

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:06.700
- Yes! - Right!

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.370
We're not weaker than them!

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.100
They're nothing special!

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:09.250
See?

00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:10.700
You can't go wrong following this sir!

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:11.460
I know,

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:12.890
even with all these treasures,

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:13.980
not everyone here

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:16.010
will walk away victorious.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.300
But as long as we give it our all,

00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:19.490
even if we lose,

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:21.460
we'll make those clan disciples see

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.670
we rogue cultivators

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.690
won't be pushed around!

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.470
We won't be pushed around!

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.530
We won't be pushed around!

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:27.180
Sir,

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.650
even though I lack talent,

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:29.420
I still want

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.250
to contribute something!

00:14:30.630 --> 00:14:31.060
Good!

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:32.650
Then,

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:33.980
those who want to help,

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:34.770
come with me!

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:35.730
All right!

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.490
Let's go!

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.130
Yes!

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.060
I'll contribute what I can!

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:40.130
Take mine!

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:41.330
- Take mine! - Here you go!

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.180
Take mine!

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:43.980
So that's their plan all along.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:52.300
Mr. Han,

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:53.820
would you be willing to help?

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.010
After hearing what you said,

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.730
I've lost interest

00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:02.340
in joining the Seven Sects.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.580
I won't join the tournament

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.490
at Tianwu Arena.

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:09.300
My friend,

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.610
this is our best chance

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:11.980
to make a name for ourselves!

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:12.610
Yeah, a golden opportunity!

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:13.250
- Right! - Totally!

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:14.790
Do your part!

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:15.940
Looks like I can't leave today

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.770
without bleeding a little.

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.730
If you've got treasures,

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:19.940
bring them out and share!

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:22.300
All right.

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.490
I happened

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:26.890
to come across

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.370
a restorative pill.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.180
I planned to keep it for myself.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:31.650
But under the circumstances,

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:34.420
I'll share it with everyone.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.700
Much appreciated, Mr.!

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.010
That's a good one.

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:41.820
Ugh, my stomach hurts.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.340
I need to take a quick break.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:45.820
You guys keep chatting.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.370
Han!

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:03.340
You...

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.730
You're fine?

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:08.010
I'm fine now.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.130
Xiaoshan,

00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.100
Are you here to talk me

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.370
into joining the Azure Vein Society?

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.730
Of course not.

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:18.770
But,

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:19.580
aren't you planning to join

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.820
the Tianwu Arena tournament

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.980
and win yourself a Foundation Pill?

00:16:23.670 --> 00:16:24.730
The Seven Sects are great,

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:26.730
but I gotta stay alive first.

00:16:27.630 --> 00:16:28.650
I knew it, Han.

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:29.730
You're not one to go in blind.

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:33.180
Well,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.580
you weren't joining the fight.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.010
So why'd you still

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:38.180
share your treasure?

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:40.530
Just trying to win us rogues a little respect.

00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:41.610
Xiaoshan.

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:45.180
I can't shake the feeling that those guys

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:46.530
aren't as simple as they look.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.650
With your kind of naivety,

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.100
you'll get burned.

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:51.300
No way!

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.850
All rogue cultivators are one big family!

00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.980
You're overthinking it, Han.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.460
With what we saved up earlier,

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.220
we've got thirty-eight artifacts now.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:02.130
Qingwen,

00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:04.060
why not take all this

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.890
and run off now?

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:06.610
No can do.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:07.820
The barrier at the Tainan Bazaar

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.420
won't lift until the tournament is over.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.340
We can't leave yet.

00:17:13.670 --> 00:17:14.650
If those rogue cultivators

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.010
give up their treasures willingly,

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:16.820
that's ideal.

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.010
If not...

00:17:20.270 --> 00:17:21.100
Don't worry, Sir!

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.300
If they won't,

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:23.220
I'll be the first to...

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.890
Yeah,

00:17:23.910 --> 00:17:24.650
we won't spare them!

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.340
How many times do I have to say it?

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.700
Stop talking about fighting and killing

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.610
all the time!

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:36.250
Get up.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:40.730
Yes, Sir.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.060
Step back.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.250
Li!

00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.490
I finally found you!

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:00.100
What is it now?

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.980
I've got more talismans here.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.770
I want to trade for more pills.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:04.770
Would that be okay?

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.890
I've got Strength Boost Talismans,

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:12.650
and Freezing Talismans.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.530
These are offensive.

00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:16.300
These ones are defensive.

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.370
This Vajra Talisman is amazing!

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:19.580
It can block

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.820
a full-force strike from a tenth-level Qi Refiner!

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.300
What about this one?

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:25.250
This is a Thunderfire Talisman.

00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:27.820
It hits with both lightning and fire at once.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.010
Look!

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.180
Maybe...

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:36.220
I'll get you two brand new ones.

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:38.850
That's weird.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.900
I followed the book's instructions exactly.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.380
Li,

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.330
how about

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.530
these two?

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:46.770
I guarantee

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.940
they're top quality.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.180
These two...

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:52.180
Miss Han,

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.090
why do you need pills so urgently?

00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.090
I want to cure my brother's illness.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.050
Sorry,

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:02.810
but your talismans

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:03.770
are not very useful

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.730
to me.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:07.010
Still,

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.900
if you've got

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.010
cinnabar and talisman paper,

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:12.380
I might be interested.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:14.810
You want to make talismans yourself?

00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.940
Then you'll

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:18.900
definitely need this!

00:19:22.790 --> 00:19:23.420
This one

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.530
is a Golden Bamboo Brush.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.980
The tip

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.770
is made from the tail hair of a Level 2 demon beast.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:28.940
The shaft

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.220
is forged from black iron mixed with refined gold.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.090
It was crafted using secret techniques

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:35.220
by a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:38.090
This is a must-have tool for talisman making!

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:51.010
A true rarity!

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:52.810
You're really selling it to me?

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:54.460
Honestly...

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.380
it's a family heirloom.

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:58.490
But as you can see,

00:19:58.790 --> 00:20:00.180
I'm terrible

00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:01.810
at making talismans.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.530
So this brush

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.620
is pretty much wasted

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.570
on me.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:07.620
How much are you asking?

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.420
Two bottles of pills.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:11.330
How about that?

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.900
I'll even throw in

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:14.770
these talismans, ink,

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.010

Li!

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:38.660
I also have a Clear Stream Note.

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.620
It's got all sorts of funny stories

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.940
from the cultivation world.

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:41.810
I've read it already.

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.250
If you get bored,

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:44.250
maybe it'll help pass the time.

[Clear Stream Note]

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:54.810
I was hoping to learn more anyway.

Let's go check out the Tianwu Arena!

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.050
I heard

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.290
the sects have prepared

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:12.770
a bunch of rewards this time

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:15.090
to attract more participants.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.050
I got a book

with all sorts of cultivation oddities.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.620
Not sure if they're true.

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.140
Want to check it out together?

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:30.900
Sure!

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.050
Come over.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.330
Clear Stream Note?

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.810
What's this?

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:55.940
Looks like

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:58.980
a token from some sect.

00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:02.330
That's not just any token.

00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:04.940
Look at the writing on it.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:10.420
Ascension Token...

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.180

What's that?

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.800
The Ascension Token

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.530
is for...

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.010
They say...

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.570
Well, I heard,

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:26.770
if you hold

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.640
an Ascension Token,

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.700
you don't have to fight,

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:30.970
don't have to take the spirit root test,

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:32.940
you get straight into any of the Seven Sects.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:34.530
Is that true?

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.570
Nonsense!

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.940
If that were true,

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:39.810
everyone would be fighting over this token.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.570
Who'd bother risking their lives at the tournament?

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:43.980
Exactly.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:45.570
Sounds like a made-up story.

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:53.420
Grandmaster,

00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.530
you were right.

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.420
Several clan disciples

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:58.050
have reported their tokens stolen.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.700
The Azure Vein Society never quit causing trouble,

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.900
even hit during the entrance test.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.180
What should we do now?

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:11.220
So those rogue cultivators' missing

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:12.660
is really linked to them.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.490
And now they're pinning it on the clan disciples.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:16.980
Once the Tianwu Arena tournament ends,

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:18.980
let's arrest them all.

00:24:21.030 --> 00:24:21.700
Yes, Grandmaster.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:45.700
Looks like

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.090
this Ascension Token

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:48.490
is tied to Yellow Maple Valley.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.420
Yellow Maple Valley...

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.140
They say it's one of the top sects

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.940
among the Seven.

00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.700

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.810

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.660
You think you're worthy of this Foundation Pill?

00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.250
I've waited for this day

00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.530

Who is this Qingwen?

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:23.010
Why does he have so many treasures?

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:25.140
Is Lu

00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:26.220
about to lose?

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:27.810
No way.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:28.980
He's just about to win.

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.490
Sir,

00:26:59.030 --> 00:26:59.620
you went easy on me.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.460
It's a test.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.660
Don't take it too far.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.090
He already admitted defeat.

00:27:18.350 --> 00:27:19.380
Why try to kill him?

00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:21.380
Grandmaster,

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.140
please forgive me.

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.620
I didn't realize

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:26.180
he had already surrendered.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.180
You didn't realize

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.570
or was it because your opponent

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:31.180
was just some nameless rogue cultivator

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.460
and you didn't care?

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.140
Thank you, Grandmaster,

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:37.380
for standing up

00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.490
for us rogue cultivators!

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.140
Yes!

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.090
Thank you for standing up for us!

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.490
Please stand up for us!

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.010
Please, we need your voice!

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.180
I'm aware many rogue cultivators have gone missing lately.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.700
Our Moonshadow Sect

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:50.940
will get to the bottom of it.

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:52.860
If anyone is found stirring up conflict

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.460
between rogues and clan disciples,

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:55.860
disrupting the order of the cultivation world,

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.140
I will not show mercy.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.330
Lu Mingyuan

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:17.050

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:19.860
Senior Lu is amazing!

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.140
You've got the Foundation Pill!

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:27.050
A cultivator's strength

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:28.530
doesn't just depend on spirit roots,

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.330
but also on artifacts,

00:28:30.750 --> 00:28:31.460
talismans,

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:32.490
formations,

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:33.290
and pills.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:35.700
Use everything you've got,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.010
plan carefully before making a move.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.250
Lay low, then explode.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:39.900
Maybe...

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.250
this is the path meant for me.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.140
But in the face of overwhelming strength,

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.290
all shortcuts

00:28:47.550 --> 00:28:48.700
are doomed to fail.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.730
- Congrats, Senior Lu! - Congrats, Senior Lu!

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:57.620
He got into Yellow Maple Valley too?

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:00.010
What are the odds!

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:10.250
Just one step...

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.420
I was just one step from victory!

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.700
Qingwen,

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:14.940
that guy's a genius

00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:16.700
with a variant spirit root after all.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:18.250
No need to go head-to-head with him.

00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:20.250
We failed this time,

00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:21.570
but there's always next time.

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.460
Next time?

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.180
You think chances like this come easy?

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.980
I told you,

00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.660
we rogue cultivators are one big family.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.770
Don't take it so hard.

00:29:28.790 --> 00:29:29.290
Enough already.

00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:30.420
You're making my heart ache.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.140
Hey...

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.290
Listen, everyone.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.770
Don't be so down.

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:42.180
I heard

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.090
if you find a certain item,

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.010
you can skip the tournament

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.770
and still get into the Seven Sects.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.380
- What item? - What is it?

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.700
I think it's called...

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.420
the Ascension Token!

00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.250
Ascension Token?

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:57.660
Ascension Token?

00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:59.730
Sir,

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:01.180
I was about to ask you.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.570
Do you know about the Ascension Token?

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.420
The Ascension Token

00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:04.730
was created by the Seven Sects.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.050
It was meant to reward

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.860
cultivation families who made great contributions.

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.730
It could be passed down for generations.

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.940
They say

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:11.860
anyone who holds one

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.220
can join any sect

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:14.330
without taking the test

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.220
and even get a Foundation Pill.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.460
A Foundation Pill?

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.380
No test and a Foundation Pill?

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:23.940
That's amazing.

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:26.010
But this thing

00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:28.180
hasn't shown up for centuries.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.140
How do you even know about it?

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:32.530
I didn't know,

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:33.530
but Han...

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.940
He read about it in a book.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.770
He asked you directly?

00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:42.420
No...

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.810
Not really.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.180
We were just casually chatting.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.090
Where's Han Li now?

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:48.660
Why isn't he here?

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:49.620
Han Li...

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.050
He's not around.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.490
Weren't you

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.050
always with him?

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.180
I don't really know him that well.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.570
I think he already left.

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:03.140
He left?

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.730
But the barrier's still active.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.010
Where could he go?

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:08.810
He...

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:09.810
I...

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.330
My stomach hurts!

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.770
I need a bathroom break!

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:22.900
Why'd he run off?

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:24.570
Is it really stomach pain?

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:25.940
You buying it?

00:31:30.550 --> 00:31:31.140
Looks like

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.330
this trip to the Tainan Bazaar wasn't for nothing.

00:31:34.270 --> 00:31:36.420
These treasures will really help my cultivation later on.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.380
So what if I have a fake spirit root?

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.730
With this Ascension Token,

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.810
I've got nothing to worry about!

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.980
I'll just stay hidden till morning.

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.530
Once the barrier lifts,

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:18.620
I'll head straight

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:20.380
to Yellow Maple Valley.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:25.250
He's there!

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:26.860
Hurry!

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.140
Stop!

00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:31.290
Stop running!

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:32.940
Get him!

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:33.700
Stop!

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:39.460
Stop!

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:40.700
He's there!

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:41.570
Quick!

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:08.370
Han!

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:09.350
Han!

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:17.860
Han!

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.890
Han!

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.980
Han!

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:22.250
Xiaoshan!

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.010
Xiaoshan!

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.140
What happened?

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:55.530
Han...

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.050
Run!

00:33:57.790 --> 00:33:59.770
Qingwen and his men are bad guys...

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:01.900
I'm sorry...

00:34:03.310 --> 00:34:03.810
I...

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:04.860
I got you

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:06.620
into trouble...

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:17.700
The Ascension Token

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:19.110
has been exposed.

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:30.380
Han!

00:34:30.750 --> 00:34:31.700
Why are you running?

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:33.290
Stay and have a drink with us!

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:12.770
Nowhere to run now, huh?

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:19.810
You two,

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.530
why are you after me?

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:22.860
What do you think?

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.660
At this point,

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:25.770
Han,

00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:27.730
you can drop the act.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:30.530
Han,

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:32.530
you're being awfully selfish.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:34.940
You got a treasure like the Ascension Token,

00:35:35.350 --> 00:35:36.330
but won't even

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.730
let us take a look?

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:39.620
Ascension Token?

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:41.180
What is that?

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:42.420
Never heard of it!

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:44.300
In broad daylight,

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.490
you're trying to rob and kill someone.

00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:48.740
Aren't you afraid the Seven Sects' punishment?

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:51.570
Enough talk.

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:53.300
Take him down first,

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:55.260
then search his body.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:37.050
Where did he go?

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:38.690
Find him!

00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:41.420
This won't work if it keeps up.

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:42.900
That Qingwen guy

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.420
is still hiding in the shadows.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.260
Han,

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.690
I see you!

00:36:59.070 --> 00:37:00.090
Stop hiding!

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:01.740
Come out!

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:13.210
A high-grade artifact!

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:16.530
Qingwen!

00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.740
Help me!

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.780
Qingwen!

00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.490
I knew you'd show up!

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:46.050
Wan Xiaoshan

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:47.740
was killed by you?

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:49.780
He was a good man.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.260
But good men...

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.690
die too.

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.530
You lost your men too.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.300
Why didn't you save them?

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:59.260
I had a feeling you had something up your sleeve.

00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.090
So I let them go first.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.010
Looks like I was right.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.900
I get it now.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.650
There are three of you,

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.210
but only one

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.490
Ascension Token.

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.050
You're a clever guy.

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:17.490
Pinggu and I go way back.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.340
If this weren't about the path to ascension,

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:21.420
I wouldn't have let her die.

00:38:24.590 --> 00:38:26.860
You really are a complete villain.

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.460
Han...

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.530
that Flying Sword Talisman

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.610
is your last trick, right?

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.420
What do you think?

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.050
This is Tainan Valley!

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:06.490
If you kill me here,

00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:07.900
aren't you afraid you'll get caught?

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.260
You showed up out of nowhere,

00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:10.010
clearly up to no good.

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:11.780
All I have to say is you snuck in here,

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:13.300
killed Wan Xiaoshan,

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.050
Wu Jiuzhi,

00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.820
and Pinggu.

00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:16.780
I'll kill you to avenge them.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:17.940
Do you think the other rogues

00:39:18.030 --> 00:39:18.690
will believe you,

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.760
or believe me?

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.690
Fine!

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:23.210
Then,

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.860
I'll use the token as bait.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:26.740
Whoever kills you,

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.090
gets it!

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:28.980
You!

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:25.050
You'd throw your life away

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:26.570
over a token?

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:28.570
You're still young.

00:40:29.550 --> 00:40:30.570
You don't understand what this means

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:32.420
to us rogue cultivators...

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.590
[Ice Demoness]

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:47.090
Who's there?

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:00.940
So, you're Daoist Qingwen?

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.650
Looks like you're dying.

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.210
But my master said

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:08.650
you can't die just yet.

00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:11.650
Which means...

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.940
he'll have to die instead.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.860
What stage is that guy in?

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.300
I can't even track his movements.

00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:26.400
If I get caught,

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:27.210
I'm dead for sure.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:28.010
I have to run!

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:46.210
Who are you, sir?

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.610
You founded the Azure Vein Society?

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:54.050
Interesting...

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:55.690
I'm just trying to stay alive.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.860
That guy earlier

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.010
had the real treasure.

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:00.050
If you can spare me,

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.490
I'll question him myself

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.940
and hand over the treasure!

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:05.460
Ascension Token?

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:09.900
A crumb tossed by the Seven Sects.

00:42:10.070 --> 00:42:11.740
You call that a treasure?

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.260
Are you interested...

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:19.650
in becoming a Foundation Establishment cultivator?

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.210
Foundation...

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.130
Senior,

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:26.460
if you can help me

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:27.980
step into the Foundation Establishment stage,

00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:29.380
I, Qingwen, will give my life

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.780
to repay you!

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.170
Senior...

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.050
Even on death's door,

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:39.170
you're still dreaming of that?

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.780
Please, help me!

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:44.610
Fine.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.420
I felt a dark aura!

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:19.900
