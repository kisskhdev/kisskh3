(I Willingly Accept Death)

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:21.696
Your Majesty,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:22.600
your tea.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.720
Is she kneeling?

00:00:33.696 --> 00:00:34.520
Your Majesty,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.360
Miss Jiuning is still kneeling.

00:00:36.768 --> 00:00:38.440
She disturbed the Empress Dowager,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.232
spoke insolently,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.560
and was slapped and expelled.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.320
In the entire harem now,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.560
no one dares take her in.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.840
She wanders like a stray dog

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.200
with nowhere to go.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.000
She's been kneeling outside

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.120
for three days.

00:00:51.616 --> 00:00:52.440
Has she admitted it?

00:00:53.952 --> 00:00:54.600
No.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.960
She only pleads for Your Majesty

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.528
to investigate Consort Shu.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.280
Let her keep kneeling.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.800
I want to see whether

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.080
her knees are harder

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.888
or the ground tiles are harder.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.040
(Imperial Study)

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.440
She's been kneeling for days.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.960
She's still here.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.720
How tragic.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.720
I couldn't endure that.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.840
Nor could I.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.280
How pitiful.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.560
Jiuning,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.560
you haven't eaten or drunk
for three days.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.640
Have some congee.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.600
Your Majesty.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.760
Forgive me.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.840
Just some congee.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.040
Let it be spilled.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.520
Missing one meal

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.600
won't starve her.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.520
Miss Jiuning,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.840
you've seen the situation
these past days.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.760
Not just in the imperial palace,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.720
but throughout the entire realm,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.840
everything hinges on His Majesty's word.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.040
Do you want to be trampled underfoot

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.240
or live a life of power and influence?

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.880
Just bow your head
and apologize to His Majesty,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.128
and you'll be second
only to the sovereign.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.440
Make your choice quickly.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.120
I...

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.760
I only beseech His Majesty

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:13.960
to investigate Consort Shu.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.720
You...

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:30.080
(Imperial Study)

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.600
Oh my.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.720
Come back.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.840
Come here.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.200
Over here.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.280
Stop running.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.720
I heard His Majesty

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.240
banned her from food and drink.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:18.880
She must be starving.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.400
When she

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.600
became an imperial handmaid,

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.960
we were so envious.

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:24.960
Serving His Majesty is indeed perilous.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.760
We'll never envy that again.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.600
The dried meat has gone bad.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.840
Even the dog won't eat it.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.120
How incompetent you are!

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.240
But...

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.720
it's not spoiled.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.840
How dare you talk back!

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.760
Begone.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.960
Yes.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.040
How many days has it been?

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.480
Your Majesty,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.200
it's already the sixth day.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:37.480
Your Majesty,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.280
it's raining outside.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.040
Miss Jiuning hasn't eaten
or drunk for days.

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.680
If this continues,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.320
she might not survive.

00:04:48.928 --> 00:04:53.344
(Imperial Study)

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.160
Your Majesty,

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.680
I...

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:07.040
I admit my fault.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.176
The physician!

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.080
Get the physician!

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.480
Yes.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.560
Your Majesty.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.840
Earlier,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.520
I had the physician examine you.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.040
You caught a chill.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.760
No need for formalities.

00:05:41.152 --> 00:05:41.840
Your Majesty,

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.120
I've come around.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.880
I am

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.480
willing to become
Your Majesty's consort.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.200
Kneeling for days,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.040
you've actually come around?

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.120
I can become Your Majesty's consort,

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.360
but I have one condition.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.920
Would Your Majesty

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.840
grant it?

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.960
If you're willing to be my consort,

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.480
let alone one condition,

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.200
I'd grant

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.000
even a hundred

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:14.120
or ten thousand.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.840
Your Majesty,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.160
my condition might be hard

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.120
to fulfill.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.400
Look at her.

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.960
She must've conceived another smart idea

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.320
to challenge me with.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.400
You're Heaven's Son,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.000
loved by all.

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.160
It seems Miss Jiuning
has finally come to her senses.

00:06:55.776 --> 00:06:56.960
I

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.080
congratulate Your Majesty.

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.320
Jiuning,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.080
Why have you brought me here?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.760
Silver candles cast autumn light,

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:14.000
cold screens shimmer.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.240
Gauze fans flutter gently,

00:07:20.096 --> 00:07:21.240
capturing dancing fireflies.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.800
That day I came here
with my sister, Talented Lady Wan,

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.080
to watch fireflies.

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.320
She gained
Your Majesty's favor that night.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.560
Yet that same favor

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.240
brought her doom.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:39.680
Talented Lady Wan's death
was lamentable.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.480
It pains me too.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.760
Your Majesty,

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.720
if my sister could return from the dead,

00:07:49.408 --> 00:07:50.360
it'd be wonderful.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.680
The departed cannot be revived.

00:07:55.392 --> 00:07:56.224
Indeed.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.720
Your Majesty must also have

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.320
someone you desperately wish to keep.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.360
I too am flesh and blood.

00:08:07.104 --> 00:08:08.960
Of course there are those
I can't bear to lose.

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:13.160
Though Your Majesty reigns supreme

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.600
as Heaven's chosen,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.480
wielding celestial power

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.920
and boundless authority,

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.920
even you cannot defy Heaven's will.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.160
For your departed beloved,

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.880
your late Empress,

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.200
even with all your might,

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.760
you remain powerless

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.080
to restore her to life.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.280
You can only

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:39.440
bury the pain of loss

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:40.840
deep within your heart.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:42.920
Therefore,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.520
in this world,

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.120
even infinite power

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.640
has its limitations.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:55.920
Your Majesty,

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:58.400
be it imperial nobility

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:59.560
or common folk,

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.040
every life is precious.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.120
My sister shouldn't have been

00:09:05.792 --> 00:09:07.560
deemed worthless
due to her humble origins

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.440
and casually destroyed.

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.880
Is your condition

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.000
that I use imperial power

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.200
to resurrect your sister?

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:21.280
Your Majesty,

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.440
can you do that?

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:28.920
Issue my decree

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.680
to release Noble Consort Xian.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.120
Yes.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.144
I heard there are doubts
about Talented Lady Wan's suicide

00:09:38.336 --> 00:09:39.160
in the Cold Palace.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.840
She was framed by Consort Shu

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.880
and died wrongfully.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.160
My investigation has revealed

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.040
greater crimes

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.960
behind Consort Shu.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.600
With solid evidence now,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.920
I beseech Your Majesty

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.320
to judge this fairly

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.840
and uphold the justice.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.240
Consort Shu's case implicates many,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.640
including imperial kin.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.960
Since I'll grant you status

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.480
as my consort,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.520
I'll champion your cause.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.688
If you still refuse the harem,

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.960
I'll grant you a chance
to plead your case.

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:19.480
But imperial dignity

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.000
must be preserved.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.760
If this case is pursued,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.480
all involved palace members

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.240
with knowledge,

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.400
including you,

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.640
will face execution.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.640
Are you willing?

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.560
If Your Majesty

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.960
will champion my justice,

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.160
I

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:53.280
willingly accept death.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.720
Also, for those

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:00.680
who were implicated

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.080
in human trafficking

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.160
to die with bitter resentment,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.680
I thank Your Majesty.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.720
Lu Jiuning

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.320
What injustice drove Talented Lady Wan

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.920
to suicide in Cold Palace?

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:29.680
Explain everything to me.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:31.800
Your Majesty,

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.240
I

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.720
originally served
as Talented Lady Wan's attendant.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.480
We entered the palace together

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.800
as tribute offerings.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.720
They say

00:11:41.216 --> 00:11:43.680
Talented Lady Wan
cursed the Empress Dowager

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.080
on her birthday banquet,

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.040
was confined by Consort Chun,

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:47.960
and took her own life.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.400
But the truth is

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.240
when Talented Lady Wan died,

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.600
she was carrying a royal heir.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.840
Consort Chun

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.600
coveted her unborn child

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.040
to claim as her own

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.072
and framed her

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.560
to be confined.

00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.120
Meanwhile, Consort Shu

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.640
feared Consort Chun would gain favor
by having that child

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.240
and threaten her own position,

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.360
so she secretly arranged

00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.800
to kill Talented Lady Wan.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.480
Consort Shu and Consort Chun

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.080
are both responsible
for Talented Lady Wan's death.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.480
I beg your fair judgment.

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:19.360
By this account

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.160
Talented Lady Wan's demise mirrors

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.920
Consort Chun's use of the physician

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.440
and control over Noble Lady Shen

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.480
to claim another's child as her own.

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:29.040
Lady Shen was fortunate

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.280
to be rescued by you.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:31.640
Yes.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.824
Talented Lady Wan died unjustly.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.400
She was caught helplessly

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.200
in Consort Chun
and Consort Shu's rivalry.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.840
Her pregnancy caused her death

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.840
along with the child's.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.320
Now

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.480
the culprit, Consort Shu,

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.240
remains unpunished.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.800
I implore Your Majesty
to deliver justice

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:54.880
and clear

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:56.800
my sister's name.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.720
Summon Consort Shu.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.480
Summon Consort Shu.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.840
Your Majesty.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.160
Consort Shu,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:14.520
answer me,

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.360
did you murder Talented Lady Wan?

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.520
Your Majesty,

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.920
I bore no grudge
against Talented Lady Wan.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.480
I never harmed her.

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:24.600
Your Majesty,

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:26.600
your former imperial attendant,

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.320
Eunuch Zhang, can verify

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:30.840
Bring him forward.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:33.840
Summon Eunuch Zhang.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.480
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.760
Eunuch Zhang,

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.080
tell me everything

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.240
you know

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.600
without omission.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:47.520
Yes,

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:48.400
Your Majesty.

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.920
I acted under Consort Shu's orders

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.520
to intercept Lu Jiuning

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.920
outside the Imperial Study.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.560
We learned from her

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.600
that Talented Lady Wan

00:13:59.040 --> 00:13:59.776
kept her pregnancy

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:00.960
from Your Majesty.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:01.840
Consort Shu

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.560
then forced me

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.320
to threaten Lady Yu, ordering her

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:06.840
to poison Talented Lady Wan

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.240
in the Cold Palace,

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.720
causing her resentful death.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:11.840
I...

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.120
I deserve death.

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.120
- I deserve death.
- Consort Shu,

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.480
anything left to say?

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.520
Your Majesty,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.360
this maid is smooth-tongued
and quick-witted.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.840
She manipulates people.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.280
She even convinced

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.480
Noble Consort Xian

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.760
and Lord Ning

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:26.800
to willingly serve

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:27.800
her purposes.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:29.880
I've been framed by them.

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.680
I've been wronged.

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:32.720
Your Majesty,

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.120
the death of my sister

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:36.480
is a personal grudge

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:38.400
between me and Consort Shu.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:39.640
I can set aside

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.880
a personal grudge for now.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.960
But Lord Ning discovered

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.000
Consort Shu colluded
with local officials

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:47.240
to traffic and enslave countless people

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.840
and amassed vast ill-gotten wealth
through this.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.080
Furthermore,

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.800
she misused Your Majesty's
imperial water carts

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.200
to smuggle gold out of the palace.

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.320
The proof is solid.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.000
She colluded with officials

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.120
and broke the law.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.600
For such heinous acts of treason,

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:05.680
she deserves death.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:07.880
Your Majesty,

00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:08.680
it's true.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:10.800
Child and woman trafficking is rampant.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I've been investigating

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.640
to uncover the true mastermind.

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.480
After extensive investigations,

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:16.560
all leads we found

00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:17.800
point to Consort Shu.
