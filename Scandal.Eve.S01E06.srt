1
00:00:30,802 --> 00:00:34,848
As of today, I will be taking over
as the new CEO of Kodama Productions,

2
00:00:35,348 --> 00:00:38,810
in place of my father,
who is now bedridden from illness.

3
00:00:38,893 --> 00:00:40,728
I am Yoko Kodama.

4
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:46,401
My father built this company
from the ground up

5
00:00:46,484 --> 00:00:51,114
and made it into what it is today
with help from many talents and employees.

6
00:00:51,948 --> 00:00:55,118
I plan to make
this company flourish even more,

7
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:59,497
and contribute to the innovation
of the industry as a whole.

8
00:01:00,748 --> 00:01:02,876
I look forward to your support.

9
00:01:14,012 --> 00:01:17,223
Many of our talents joined
because of Mr. Shigeru's charisma.

10
00:01:17,307 --> 00:01:19,893
Doesn't feel like
Ms. Yoko can live up to him.

11
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:22,812
You think we'll lose cohesion?

12
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:29,319
I just hope the talents
won't start leaving us.

13
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:36,075
I will create a new
Kodama Productions with my own strength.

14
00:01:36,743 --> 00:01:42,290
The winner of the Kodama Productions
Next Star Audition 2020 is…

15
00:01:44,834 --> 00:01:46,169
Ms. Yuri Hara!

16
00:01:46,252 --> 00:01:47,253
Congratulations!

17
00:01:50,882 --> 00:01:52,634
Come to the center of the stage.

18
00:01:56,721 --> 00:02:01,184
To achieve that, I will create a new star.

19
00:02:05,355 --> 00:02:06,189
Yuri.

20
00:02:06,272 --> 00:02:11,903
I've landed a lead role for you
in JBS's Wednesday 9:00 p.m. drama slot.

21
00:02:12,612 --> 00:02:15,114
-What?
-Filming starts next month.

22
00:02:15,198 --> 00:02:19,911
The actor they'd hired had to drop out,
so they offered you the role instead!

23
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,955
But I'm still--

24
00:02:22,038 --> 00:02:25,291
You'll be fine!
This is a very rare opportunity.

25
00:02:26,626 --> 00:02:29,337
It's a premium time slot!
And for a series, no less.

26
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,130
You'll be famous overnight!

27
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:34,676
Okay.

28
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:36,886
Do your best, okay?

29
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,054
I will.

30
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,015
Isn't it too soon for Yuri?

31
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,017
The filming starts so soon.

32
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:45,561
JBS practically begged me to.

33
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:50,608
The conditions aren't ideal, but I secured
a main role for their April series too.

34
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:54,529
But if the ratings don't turn out well,
she'll get bashed for certain.

35
00:02:54,612 --> 00:02:57,740
It's too much for her to handle.
She needs more experience--

36
00:02:57,824 --> 00:03:01,119
We'll pass up opportunities
if we take our time.

37
00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:05,999
Now is the time for Yuri
to get her name out.

38
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,626
Don't you even get that?

39
00:03:09,752 --> 00:03:10,795
But she's--

40
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:14,549
You're no longer in charge of Yuri.

41
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:29,313
NEW QUEEN OF LOW RATINGS
YURI HARA

42
00:03:29,897 --> 00:03:31,816
DISASTROUS PERFORMANCE BY LEAD ACTRESS

43
00:03:37,113 --> 00:03:38,656
How's Yuri doing?

44
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:44,871
She managed to finish filming,
but she seems pretty shaken up.

45
00:03:46,414 --> 00:03:48,082
She might need a break.

46
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,710
What are you saying?

47
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:54,130
Her next shoot is coming up soon.
What about that?

48
00:03:57,925 --> 00:03:59,135
Excuse me.

49
00:04:01,387 --> 00:04:02,513
Hello?

50
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:06,601
What?

51
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:12,482
Yuri…

52
00:04:16,444 --> 00:04:17,487
Yuri…

53
00:04:22,617 --> 00:04:24,327
Yuri…

54
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:30,041
You monster!

55
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:33,086
You people killed Yuri.

56
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:37,548
Give me my Yuri back.

57
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:39,509
Give her back.

58
00:04:40,009 --> 00:04:42,178
Give my Yuri back!

59
00:05:00,029 --> 00:05:03,449
Yuri's parents
are threatening to sue the agency.

60
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:10,373
They're saying she killed herself
due to the agency's overzealous approach.

61
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,458
How should we respond?

62
00:05:18,005 --> 00:05:19,966
Call Kondo, the journalist.

63
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,559
A SAD FATHER-DAUGHTER STORY
ACTRESS YURI HARA

64
00:05:29,642 --> 00:05:32,728
THE REASON FOR SUICIDE
WAS A FINANCIAL DISPUTE WITH HER FATHER

65
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:34,647
YASUO KONDO, FREELANCE JOURNALIST

66
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,483
It was a shame what happened to Yuri.

67
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:44,907
But there's nothing we can do
about someone's personal troubles.

68
00:05:47,535 --> 00:05:48,661
Is that really so?

69
00:05:51,873 --> 00:05:56,502
I think we share part of the blame
for what happened to Yuri.

70
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,088
Are you saying it was my fault?

71
00:05:59,672 --> 00:06:04,427
You can't nurture actors by giving them
lead roles that they haven't earned.

72
00:06:06,429 --> 00:06:10,224
I will nurture actors
with a different method.

73
00:06:13,603 --> 00:06:16,105
Are you saying you plan to go independent…

74
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:18,024
and leave us?

75
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,324
Do you really think you can antagonize
Kodama Pro and still get by?

76
00:06:29,118 --> 00:06:31,746
Thank you for all you've done for me.

77
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,925
-Kuryu's leaving us?
-Yes.

78
00:06:44,926 --> 00:06:47,136
He says he won't renew his contract.

79
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,346
Don't tell me…

80
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:51,015
Yes.

81
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,643
He's signing with Ioka's agency.

82
00:06:58,356 --> 00:07:02,360
Tell the program directors of all
TV stations to deny Kuryu any roles

83
00:07:02,443 --> 00:07:05,363
and that we'll withdraw
our talents if they don't comply.

84
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,991
Yes, ma'am.

85
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:16,666
JOINT COMPANY INFO SESSION

86
00:07:21,963 --> 00:07:24,215
Ma'am, do you have a moment?

87
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:26,759
Sorry.

88
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,597
-It's about JBS TV's special drama.
-Yes?

89
00:07:32,306 --> 00:07:36,269
The actor starring alongside Mr. Aso
is going to be Kuryu Fujiwara.

90
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:38,813
How is that possible?

91
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,899
JBS wouldn't dare do that.

92
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:43,776
Well…

93
00:07:45,194 --> 00:07:47,280
apparently, the chairman allowed it.

94
00:07:50,324 --> 00:07:51,951
What is the meaning of this?

95
00:07:52,618 --> 00:07:54,036
Meaning of what?

96
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:58,124
Why did you allow Kuryu to get the role?

97
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,590
Why do you side with Ioka to this extent?

98
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,928
Do you hate me that much?

99
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:13,973
Don't flaunt your own pettiness!

100
00:08:30,906 --> 00:08:33,034
A US-Japan joint production.

101
00:08:33,117 --> 00:08:37,538
We'll make the announcement
after the JBS special drama conference.

102
00:08:37,622 --> 00:08:39,206
So it's finally time.

103
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:42,835
Let's make sure
your American debut goes well.

104
00:08:43,794 --> 00:08:44,920
Which is why…

105
00:08:47,298 --> 00:08:48,382
What is it?

106
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:57,475
I'm counting on you, okay?

107
00:08:58,142 --> 00:08:59,268
Of course.

108
00:09:00,144 --> 00:09:02,063
I'm very grateful to you.

109
00:09:02,688 --> 00:09:04,065
I'll repay the favor.

110
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:17,536
Sexually assaulted by Aso?

111
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:21,082
The other party came to us.

112
00:09:23,501 --> 00:09:27,296
It was your leadership that made
Mr. Aso into the face of your agency,

113
00:09:27,963 --> 00:09:31,425
which is precisely why
if people found out about this,

114
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:33,969
you would be forced
to take responsibility.

115
00:09:37,431 --> 00:09:40,851
I expect the public
will react quite strongly,

116
00:09:41,435 --> 00:09:44,772
especially considering the subject matter.

117
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:56,283
For next year,

118
00:09:56,367 --> 00:10:01,747
we'll give Buncho exclusive rights to sell
calendars featuring our idol talents.

119
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,418
On top of that…

120
00:10:08,295 --> 00:10:11,006
I'm sure you need
another scoop in exchange.

121
00:10:18,514 --> 00:10:21,559
An alleged affair
by celebrity actor Kuryu Fujiwara.

122
00:10:22,435 --> 00:10:24,395
Should get plenty of attention, no?

123
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:30,526
KURYU FUJIWARA DRANK
AND CHEATED WITH AN UNDERAGE GIRL

124
00:10:40,035 --> 00:10:41,370
This is fine.

125
00:10:47,835 --> 00:10:50,337
Everything's proceeding smoothly.

126
00:10:53,257 --> 00:10:54,925
Or so I had thought.

127
00:10:55,843 --> 00:11:01,015
WILL

128
00:12:28,727 --> 00:12:29,895
Mom.

129
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:32,982
Riko.

130
00:12:33,857 --> 00:12:35,192
She's asleep.

131
00:12:36,277 --> 00:12:38,070
They said she would survive.

132
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,073
Thank goodness.

133
00:12:42,408 --> 00:12:44,493
How did this happen?

134
00:12:47,288 --> 00:12:48,539
What happened?

135
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,542
Pardon me.

136
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:56,297
Ms. Hirata?

137
00:12:59,717 --> 00:13:01,135
Oh dear.

138
00:13:02,595 --> 00:13:04,680
Excuse me. Are you an acquaintance?

139
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:05,723
Not quite.

140
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:09,226
Here's who I am.

141
00:13:11,979 --> 00:13:14,315
I'm Kondo, a freelance journalist.

142
00:13:14,398 --> 00:13:18,736
I was gathering information
from your daughter about a certain case.

143
00:13:19,486 --> 00:13:21,280
What a close call, though.

144
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:23,532
She almost got away.

145
00:13:23,616 --> 00:13:25,534
They do say dead men tell no tales.

146
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:29,288
What do you mean?

147
00:13:29,371 --> 00:13:30,331
Wait.

148
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:32,374
You don't know?

149
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:34,293
-It's pretty big news--
-Wait.

150
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:36,712
Let's talk outside.

151
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,725
What are you up to?

152
00:13:49,808 --> 00:13:51,602
Even coming all the way here.

153
00:13:52,603 --> 00:13:55,314
What am I up to?
Just gathering information.

154
00:13:57,066 --> 00:13:59,526
You wrote that article, didn't you?

155
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:03,572
The one saying Riko made up
the assault for money and publicity.

156
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:04,615
Yes.

157
00:14:05,282 --> 00:14:08,243
And I plan to write
a follow-up to that one soon.

158
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:11,747
About how the hostess
who claimed sexual assault had a relative,

159
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,791
who happens to work for Weekly Buncho.

160
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:18,295
What if Weekly Buncho made her lie
to get a big story out of it?

161
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:20,214
Now that's a scoop.

162
00:14:20,965 --> 00:14:22,549
Can I get…

163
00:14:24,176 --> 00:14:25,302
a comment on that?

164
00:14:26,971 --> 00:14:30,182
What are you even thinking?

165
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:34,478
My sister almost died.

166
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:37,398
All because of your made-up article.

167
00:14:39,608 --> 00:14:41,151
What gives you the right?

168
00:14:41,735 --> 00:14:44,905
As if you haven't done
the same thing as well.

169
00:14:48,951 --> 00:14:53,205
Whether it's made-up or not,
it just has to get the public's attention.

170
00:14:53,956 --> 00:14:56,083
Isn't that what our job's all about?

171
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,796
Anyway, I'll scram for today.

172
00:15:02,131 --> 00:15:03,507
I'll come again.

173
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,986
I see. He visited you at the hospital?

174
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:27,448
He's the freelance journalist
who wrote the article on Riko.

175
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:28,991
You should watch out too.

176
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:30,576
Thanks for informing me.

177
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:33,495
Please stay with Ms. Riko for now.

178
00:15:33,996 --> 00:15:34,830
Bye.

179
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,209
Ma'am.

180
00:15:39,835 --> 00:15:40,878
How's Ms. Riko?

181
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,297
Her life's not in danger.

182
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:46,884
That's good.

183
00:15:47,718 --> 00:15:51,472
But we're back to square one
regarding the sexual assault.

184
00:15:51,555 --> 00:15:54,475
We can't expect
Ms. Riko's cooperation as she is now.

185
00:15:54,558 --> 00:15:58,812
The criticism against Ms. Riko
seems to have dialed down for now.

186
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:01,940
They're just bored
by the lack of new info.

187
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:05,277
If we pursue Aso for the sexual assault,

188
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,030
they'll attack her again
with baseless speculations.

189
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:10,532
Just like with Yuri.

190
00:16:12,576 --> 00:16:13,660
Ms. Saki.

191
00:16:15,204 --> 00:16:16,330
I'm sorry.

192
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,375
It's about Mr. Fujiwara's online drama.

193
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:23,170
He's been let go.

194
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:29,927
One of his co-stars
was with Kodama Productions,

195
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:31,470
and they raised a complaint.

196
00:16:31,553 --> 00:16:32,763
That's just…

197
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:34,098
I'm sorry.

198
00:16:34,181 --> 00:16:39,144
I tried to negotiate with them
to let him stay on, but it didn't work.

199
00:16:40,813 --> 00:16:42,940
I'm so sorry. It's all my fault.

200
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:44,566
It's not.

201
00:16:45,317 --> 00:16:47,611
I should have supported you properly.

202
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:51,782
You did more than enough
to get things going.

203
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:53,700
I'm sorry.

204
00:16:58,163 --> 00:16:59,123
Do we let Fujiwara…

205
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:04,962
I'll tell him myself.

206
00:17:11,135 --> 00:17:13,554
Sorry to call you here all of a sudden.

207
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:14,763
It's fine.

208
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:17,599
It's a shame about that online drama.

209
00:17:17,683 --> 00:17:20,227
-Your comeback was so close.
-What?

210
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:23,647
You haven't heard?

211
00:17:29,486 --> 00:17:31,071
You've made the wrong decision.

212
00:17:32,573 --> 00:17:34,658
But I'll give you a chance.

213
00:17:47,462 --> 00:17:49,131
It's not too late for you.

214
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,928
I can guarantee you a comeback
and turn you into a star.

215
00:17:57,806 --> 00:18:02,686
I wonder if Ioka
could manage the same thing.

216
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,612
EXCLUSIVITY CONTRACT

217
00:18:31,298 --> 00:18:34,092
THE WRITER OF RIKO'S ARTICLE
CAME TO THE HOSPITAL.

218
00:18:34,176 --> 00:18:37,554
HE MIGHT BE CONNECTED
TO KODAMA PRODUCTIONS.

219
00:18:37,638 --> 00:18:40,974
FREELANCE JOURNALIST, YASUO KONDO

220
00:18:44,561 --> 00:18:46,271
ACTRESS YURI HARA
SUICIDE

221
00:18:46,355 --> 00:18:48,273
YASUO KONDO, FREELANCE JOURNALIST

222
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:18,720
Excuse me, you can't just--

223
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:20,013
Ioka.

224
00:19:20,097 --> 00:19:21,974
What is this? How rude of you--

225
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:24,685
It was you. First Yuri and now this.

226
00:19:25,352 --> 00:19:26,436
What are you on about?

227
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,065
Riko Hirata tried to commit suicide.
Thankfully, she managed to survive.

228
00:19:30,774 --> 00:19:33,402
Who? I'm afraid
I've never heard that name.

229
00:19:34,486 --> 00:19:38,031
Ms. Riko tried to go public
about being assaulted by Aso.

230
00:19:38,115 --> 00:19:41,743
But then an article defaming her came out.
That was your doing, wasn't it?

231
00:19:41,827 --> 00:19:43,537
Do you have any proof of that?

232
00:19:44,621 --> 00:19:45,872
Yasuo Kondo.

233
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:47,833
I could never forget.

234
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,545
That's the reporter who wrote
an article about Yuri Hara,

235
00:19:51,628 --> 00:19:54,006
after her suicide four year ago.

236
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:57,259
He made it seem like her suicide

237
00:19:57,342 --> 00:19:59,803
was caused by financial disputes
with her father.

238
00:20:01,138 --> 00:20:03,640
You orchestrated that too, didn't you?

239
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:07,978
If people knew that work-related issues
might have caused her suicide,

240
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:12,274
it would be seen as a management failure
and damage the agency's reputation!

241
00:20:14,026 --> 00:20:15,444
Are you done yet?

242
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:20,866
I don't have time
for your speculative nonsense.

243
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:24,536
Do you not feel anything?

244
00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:27,956
Do you value
your agency's reputation that much?

245
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,875
You'd sacrifice lives for it?

246
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,752
You think that's acceptable?

247
00:20:31,835 --> 00:20:33,712
You're the one sacrificing lives!

248
00:20:33,795 --> 00:20:34,588
What?

249
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:37,341
What did you ever do
for Yuri Hara and Kuryu Fujiwara?

250
00:20:37,424 --> 00:20:41,636
You failed to provide a suitable stage
for them or to protect them from harm!

251
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,138
On the contrary,

252
00:20:43,221 --> 00:20:46,433
they both lost their future
because they were involved with you.

253
00:20:47,476 --> 00:20:50,812
And you dare speak to me of management?

254
00:20:54,608 --> 00:20:57,903
Kuryu learned his lesson the hard way.

255
00:21:00,155 --> 00:21:01,948
I talked to him just now.

256
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:03,867
With Kuryu?

257
00:21:04,576 --> 00:21:06,453
If he returns to us,

258
00:21:06,536 --> 00:21:09,915
I promised to get him lead roles
in at least two TV dramas per year,

259
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:11,625
as well as four ad contracts.

260
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:16,505
And earnings upwards of 200 million yen
in the first year alone.

261
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:19,091
You sold him out to a weekly magazine!

262
00:21:19,174 --> 00:21:21,510
-And now you--
-The choice lies with Kuryu.

263
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:27,641
I'm curious what choice he'll make.

264
00:21:28,892 --> 00:21:30,227
Aren't you?

265
00:21:43,115 --> 00:21:44,908
EXCLUSIVITY CONTRACT

266
00:22:24,656 --> 00:22:27,742
Please leave a message after the beep.

267
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:32,706
Hey, Kuryu?

268
00:22:33,456 --> 00:22:34,958
I need to talk to you.

269
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:37,377
Can you call me back?

270
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:10,327
Ninomiya?

271
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:35,477
Her condition is stable for now.

272
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,811
She's fine.

273
00:23:37,646 --> 00:23:38,563
I see.

274
00:23:57,207 --> 00:24:00,752
Besides your sister,
Aso assaulted others too.

275
00:24:07,884 --> 00:24:10,762
I went and talked to a couple of them.

276
00:24:12,806 --> 00:24:13,640
What?

277
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:20,063
They saw your sister's post
and found the courage to speak out too.

278
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,944
If multiple people give their testimony,

279
00:24:26,027 --> 00:24:28,405
his agency can't just
dismiss it all as lies.

280
00:24:30,907 --> 00:24:31,866
But why?

281
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:36,371
If I hadn't given up on the article…

282
00:24:38,707 --> 00:24:40,458
this wouldn't have happened to her.

283
00:24:44,212 --> 00:24:46,298
I'm really sorry.

284
00:24:56,808 --> 00:24:57,767
Kanade…

285
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:00,854
you should write the article.

286
00:25:02,522 --> 00:25:05,442
Make sure your sister's actions
weren't in vain.

287
00:25:15,243 --> 00:25:16,786
I'll get in touch later.

288
00:26:09,547 --> 00:26:10,507
Riko!

289
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,310
They're all talking about me.

290
00:26:24,521 --> 00:26:28,775
But none of them
are listening to what I said.

291
00:26:31,277 --> 00:26:34,781
The truth won't get through to anyone!

292
00:26:41,663 --> 00:26:43,832
I wonder what will happen if I die.

293
00:26:44,874 --> 00:26:47,710
Will they believe me then?

294
00:26:52,632 --> 00:26:55,760
Or will they just insult me more?

295
00:26:58,555 --> 00:26:59,514
Riko!

296
00:27:03,351 --> 00:27:04,644
Trust in me.

297
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,482
I'll make sure…

298
00:27:10,817 --> 00:27:12,610
the truth gets out.

299
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,638
Ms. Saki.

300
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:44,976
Thanks for coming.

301
00:27:46,853 --> 00:27:48,980
-I'll have what she had.
-Yes, sir.

302
00:27:57,822 --> 00:27:59,073
The online drama…

303
00:28:00,825 --> 00:28:02,035
didn't work out.

304
00:28:06,748 --> 00:28:07,999
Is that so?

305
00:28:10,376 --> 00:28:11,377
I'm sorry.

306
00:28:17,383 --> 00:28:18,426
I just…

307
00:28:20,094 --> 00:28:23,223
couldn't accept the old ways
where the agency's influence

308
00:28:23,306 --> 00:28:25,266
determined everything.

309
00:28:26,726 --> 00:28:29,145
That's why I created Rafale.

310
00:28:29,938 --> 00:28:32,774
To try to change the industry,
at least a little.

311
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:41,157
But really, what I couldn't accept
most of all was myself.

312
00:28:44,702 --> 00:28:46,454
I couldn't protect Yuri.

313
00:28:50,667 --> 00:28:55,255
In the end,
I haven't changed a bit since then.

314
00:28:58,883 --> 00:29:00,677
I ruined your future, too.

315
00:29:04,764 --> 00:29:05,849
I'm sorry.

316
00:29:10,562 --> 00:29:11,479
Here you go, sir.

317
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:21,072
You met Ms. Yoko, right?

318
00:29:23,783 --> 00:29:24,617
Yes.

319
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:28,162
I heard about the offer she made.

320
00:29:30,832 --> 00:29:36,254
Whatever you decide,
I promise to respect your wishes.

321
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:46,347
I thought about dying.

322
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,020
After that scandal…

323
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:57,317
I lost my family, my work, everything.

324
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,985
MET AT A BAR
AND SPENT THE NIGHT AT A HOTEL

325
00:29:59,068 --> 00:30:02,697
On TV, they were
spreading rumors about me.

326
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:07,619
And on social media,
people were telling me to go die.

327
00:30:10,496 --> 00:30:13,625
I was genuinely about to lose it.

328
00:30:15,793 --> 00:30:19,839
Even death seemed better
than going through all of that.

329
00:30:20,965 --> 00:30:22,091
It really did.

330
00:30:25,678 --> 00:30:26,638
But…

331
00:30:28,681 --> 00:30:29,849
In that moment…

332
00:30:32,644 --> 00:30:34,479
you visited me, Ms. Saki.

333
00:30:36,064 --> 00:30:38,149
It's because you stayed by my side…

334
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:42,362
that I was able to pull through.

335
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:46,491
You're the reason I'm still alive.

336
00:30:47,742 --> 00:30:51,412
I'm only here now
because you were there for me.

337
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,709
That's why I have
no intention of leaving Rafale.

338
00:30:56,793 --> 00:30:57,710
No matter what.

339
00:30:59,045 --> 00:30:59,879
Kuryu.

340
00:31:01,214 --> 00:31:04,759
If we give up now, nothing will change.

341
00:31:04,842 --> 00:31:06,511
Think of the industry.

342
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:16,187
Also, I showed the contract
from Kodama Productions to Mirei too.

343
00:31:16,938 --> 00:31:17,981
And guess what?

344
00:31:21,985 --> 00:31:23,486
Can you believe this?

345
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:25,363
What are these terms?

346
00:31:25,446 --> 00:31:27,240
The agency takes a 70% cut?

347
00:31:28,491 --> 00:31:30,201
Absolutely unbelievable.

348
00:31:32,328 --> 00:31:33,579
They're mocking you.

349
00:31:33,663 --> 00:31:35,081
She was pissed.

350
00:31:35,873 --> 00:31:36,708
What?

351
00:31:37,375 --> 00:31:39,127
That their cut was too high.

352
00:31:40,044 --> 00:31:42,630
Even Rafale would be
better than this, she said.

353
00:31:43,172 --> 00:31:45,049
Wait, "even" Rafale?

354
00:31:46,676 --> 00:31:47,885
Well, yeah.

355
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,895
I'll keep following your lead, Ms. Saki.

356
00:32:04,027 --> 00:32:05,028
Thank you.

357
00:32:20,043 --> 00:32:21,044
Tomorrow at 10 a.m.,

358
00:32:21,127 --> 00:32:24,464
I'll meet another talent
who was assaulted by Aso.

359
00:32:24,547 --> 00:32:26,424
She's willing to testify?

360
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:27,341
Yes.

361
00:32:27,425 --> 00:32:30,428
She hadn't even told
her own agency about it yet,

362
00:32:30,511 --> 00:32:32,764
but Riko's post gave her the motivation.

363
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:38,644
But she might face intimidation
from her agency or Kodama Productions

364
00:32:38,728 --> 00:32:40,563
if she comes forward with her story.

365
00:32:41,647 --> 00:32:44,734
She wants to continue
her activities in the industry.

366
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,903
Could you help her out?

367
00:32:47,653 --> 00:32:50,198
Of course. I'll help in any way I can.

368
00:32:52,325 --> 00:32:55,119
We can't let this injustice continue.

369
00:32:56,037 --> 00:33:02,210
Being forced into ignoring
unacceptable behavior is just outrageous.

370
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:17,433
Good evening, sir.

371
00:33:24,065 --> 00:33:26,567
What have you been digging into?

372
00:33:30,488 --> 00:33:32,698
Did you think I hadn't noticed?

373
00:33:54,387 --> 00:33:56,597
I couldn't bring myself to tell anyone.

374
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:00,351
I'm scared to do it even now.

375
00:34:02,436 --> 00:34:08,776
But when I saw Riko Hirata's post online,
I knew I couldn't just stay quiet.

376
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:13,030
We promise to keep
our sources confidential.

377
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,201
Thank you for being brave.

378
00:34:17,285 --> 00:34:19,579
We'll make sure your courage isn't wasted.

379
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:38,472
I'll be talking
to another person tomorrow.

380
00:34:39,182 --> 00:34:42,977
With this many testimonies,
they can't talk their way out of it.

381
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,938
Only thing left is how to make it public.

382
00:34:46,022 --> 00:34:49,609
Weekly Buncho would be
the best option, considering its reach.

383
00:34:49,692 --> 00:34:54,447
I doubt the editor-in-chief will allow it.
It's more likely that he'll cover it up.

384
00:34:56,157 --> 00:34:58,326
Should we go with a different medium?

385
00:35:03,247 --> 00:35:04,248
Hello there.

386
00:35:05,458 --> 00:35:06,584
Sir?

387
00:35:07,919 --> 00:35:09,670
Why are you here?

388
00:35:09,754 --> 00:35:11,839
You were making some strange moves.

389
00:35:12,548 --> 00:35:13,591
I just kept watch.

390
00:35:15,676 --> 00:35:17,053
Sorry for barging in.

391
00:35:17,929 --> 00:35:19,889
Please take my card.

392
00:35:28,814 --> 00:35:32,276
You seriously plan to publish
an article on Aso's sexual assaults?

393
00:35:34,862 --> 00:35:36,530
It won't just be Buncho.

394
00:35:37,281 --> 00:35:39,867
You'll be blacklisted
by basically all publishers.

395
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:41,994
I'll live with that.

396
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,540
You want to help your sister
at the cost of your career?

397
00:35:48,376 --> 00:35:49,669
How touching.

398
00:35:49,752 --> 00:35:51,254
That's not it.

399
00:35:51,337 --> 00:35:52,964
Her being family is irrelevant.

400
00:35:54,674 --> 00:35:57,635
As a reporter,
I feel like this is the right call.

401
00:36:06,811 --> 00:36:07,853
In that case…

402
00:36:09,146 --> 00:36:10,481
put it in Weekly Buncho.

403
00:36:12,066 --> 00:36:13,109
What?

404
00:36:14,277 --> 00:36:17,029
What a fancy office, by the way.

405
00:36:20,491 --> 00:36:22,868
You'll write it no matter what, right?

406
00:36:22,952 --> 00:36:24,912
Then write it for Weekly Buncho.

407
00:36:27,623 --> 00:36:29,250
But why?

408
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,335
You suppressed the article before.

409
00:36:34,005 --> 00:36:35,923
What are you plotting now?

410
00:36:36,632 --> 00:36:38,676
When Ninomiya first came to me,

411
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,763
I thought it was a tough sell
with only one person's account.

412
00:36:43,389 --> 00:36:48,853
However, the story's different
if you have several people's testimonies.

413
00:36:49,645 --> 00:36:52,690
A big scoop like this
has to go to Weekly Buncho.

414
00:36:54,025 --> 00:36:58,404
I plan to mention the connection between
Weekly Buncho and Kodama Productions.

415
00:36:58,487 --> 00:37:00,448
And your collusion with Yoko Kodama.

416
00:37:00,531 --> 00:37:01,949
Go right ahead!

417
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:03,868
It could ruin your career.

418
00:37:03,951 --> 00:37:06,454
You might even be dismissed from your job.

419
00:37:07,246 --> 00:37:09,290
I would expect nothing less.

420
00:37:12,293 --> 00:37:13,627
It's been long enough.

421
00:37:16,339 --> 00:37:18,883
I applied to the early retirement program.

422
00:37:18,966 --> 00:37:21,177
I'll get a hefty severance payment too.

423
00:37:23,888 --> 00:37:27,141
Organizations are best used
to your benefit, you know?

424
00:37:28,768 --> 00:37:31,520
I'll be waiting for your draft.

425
00:37:39,362 --> 00:37:41,197
You've got a nice agency.

426
00:38:02,885 --> 00:38:04,095
Excuse me.

427
00:38:04,887 --> 00:38:06,889
Weekly Buncho sent us this.

428
00:38:09,517 --> 00:38:10,601
REQUEST FOR VERIFICATION

429
00:38:10,684 --> 00:38:12,520
HIDETO ASO'S SEXUAL ASSAULT ALLEGATIONS

430
00:38:21,028 --> 00:38:21,862
Yes?

431
00:38:21,946 --> 00:38:25,032
I just received a questionnaire
from Weekly Buncho.

432
00:38:25,116 --> 00:38:26,617
This must be a mistake.

433
00:38:27,535 --> 00:38:28,953
It's not a mistake.

434
00:38:29,578 --> 00:38:30,871
What do you mean?

435
00:38:31,997 --> 00:38:34,291
Well, the tides have turned.

436
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:35,918
Of the times?

437
00:38:37,128 --> 00:38:38,921
You betrayed me?

438
00:38:39,004 --> 00:38:40,131
Betrayed?

439
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,259
Sounds like what
a weekly magazine would do.

440
00:38:43,342 --> 00:38:46,637
A friend in need
makes for a good scoop indeed.

441
00:38:48,097 --> 00:38:52,852
I expect you understand what will become
of your standing after doing this?

442
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,646
Sure.

443
00:38:57,356 --> 00:39:00,151
I gave up on becoming
the managing director.

444
00:39:00,234 --> 00:39:04,280
I'm not really the type
to lead an entire organization.

445
00:39:06,031 --> 00:39:07,074
Goodbye then.

446
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,752
Tell all the news stations
not to cover this.

447
00:39:18,836 --> 00:39:20,963
And stop the article from coming out!

448
00:39:21,046 --> 00:39:23,674
-But--
-Just do it, whatever it takes!

449
00:39:34,477 --> 00:39:36,103
This is the final draft.

450
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:38,606
HIDETO ASO'S SEXUAL ASSAULT
LINK BETWEEN KODAMA PRO & BUNCHO?

451
00:39:40,024 --> 00:39:42,443
Kodama Productions did not respond.

452
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,571
We'll send it to the press then.

453
00:39:45,654 --> 00:39:48,282
We can finally put an end to everything.

454
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:53,621
Thank you.

455
00:39:56,248 --> 00:39:57,249
Ma'am.

456
00:40:00,252 --> 00:40:01,253
Excuse me.

457
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,632
A visitor for you.

458
00:40:07,134 --> 00:40:08,260
Akashi?

459
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:14,517
We need to talk.

460
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:07,838
WEEKLY BUNCHO
NOVEMBER 6 ISSUE

461
00:42:14,845 --> 00:42:16,138
Excuse me.

462
00:42:32,988 --> 00:42:34,990
UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT
ALLEGEDLY FAKED CREDENTIALS

463
00:42:39,703 --> 00:42:41,705
Looks like it went well.

464
00:43:28,252 --> 00:43:31,797
I would like to thank
all of you for coming here today.

465
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,009
Just as we informed
the media outlets in advance,

466
00:43:36,093 --> 00:43:40,097
I called you here to discuss
the details of an article

467
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:43,475
which was to be published
in today's issue of Weekly Buncho,

468
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:47,187
and contained allegations
of sexual assault by Actor A.

469
00:43:51,442 --> 00:43:52,609
What is this?

470
00:43:53,152 --> 00:43:54,528
Didn't you stop the article?

471
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:58,407
I saw the questionnaire you sent.

472
00:43:59,032 --> 00:44:00,534
And you came to stop us?

473
00:44:01,326 --> 00:44:02,202
It's pointless.

474
00:44:02,286 --> 00:44:04,872
No. That's not why I'm here.

475
00:44:07,082 --> 00:44:12,045
The article defaming Ms. Riko Hirata,
the leak about Fujiwara's scandal,

476
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:15,674
and the scandal article
after Yuri Hara's death.

477
00:44:16,592 --> 00:44:19,887
I arranged all of them
as directed by Yoko Kodama.

478
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:22,306
I am truly…

479
00:44:24,391 --> 00:44:26,018
I am truly sorry for what l did!

480
00:44:31,774 --> 00:44:33,901
I know what Aso did to Ms. Riko…

481
00:44:35,194 --> 00:44:37,780
and to several other women.

482
00:44:37,863 --> 00:44:38,906
I knew…

483
00:44:39,948 --> 00:44:42,910
and turned a blind eye
to it all this time.

484
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:49,333
If it's not too late,
I want to provide my testimony.

485
00:44:50,209 --> 00:44:51,418
Please!

486
00:44:58,383 --> 00:44:59,259
Akashi.

487
00:45:08,435 --> 00:45:12,147
Why did you suddenly decide
that you want to testify?

488
00:45:12,898 --> 00:45:17,444
I want to stop Kodama Productions
and Ms. Yoko herself, with my testimony!

489
00:45:21,782 --> 00:45:26,078
If you're truly willing
to provide your account,

490
00:45:26,161 --> 00:45:28,288
it will raise the article's credibility.

491
00:45:30,457 --> 00:45:31,875
Are you really sure?

492
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:35,170
I'm prepared.

493
00:45:38,048 --> 00:45:39,216
I understand.

494
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,426
I'll start editing at once.

495
00:45:42,135 --> 00:45:43,512
Please wait!

496
00:45:46,765 --> 00:45:48,559
Can we stop the publication?

497
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:51,770
-What?
-Ma'am, what are you saying?

498
00:45:51,853 --> 00:45:57,568
If we keep going, we'll be no different
from Kodama Pro and their methods.

499
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:04,074
I think we should take responsibility
for the information we put out there.

500
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:10,163
If we don't, we can't truly change
the current situation.

501
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:22,050
In the process
of our independent investigation,

502
00:46:22,134 --> 00:46:24,511
we obtained several testimonies

503
00:46:24,595 --> 00:46:27,431
from people who were
sexually assaulted by Actor A.

504
00:46:28,307 --> 00:46:30,976
Given the similarities in his methods,

505
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:35,939
we think there's a high likelihood
he regularly engages in sexual assault.

506
00:46:36,982 --> 00:46:39,359
As for the particulars of this case,

507
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:44,281
we shall not share any details as we
have handed the case over to the police.

508
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:48,952
Furthermore, an article was posted online,

509
00:46:49,036 --> 00:46:53,540
defaming a woman
who tried to speak out about this case,

510
00:46:53,624 --> 00:46:56,335
accusing her of faking it
for settlement money.

511
00:46:56,418 --> 00:46:59,338
The contents of this article
are utterly baseless,

512
00:46:59,421 --> 00:47:02,215
and we are considering
legal action in response.

513
00:47:03,425 --> 00:47:08,680
Are you talking about the accusation
against Hideto Aso that blew up online?

514
00:47:08,764 --> 00:47:11,016
Wasn't that a false accusation?

515
00:47:11,099 --> 00:47:12,392
-Right.
-What about it?

516
00:47:12,476 --> 00:47:14,227
As I said earlier,

517
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:17,522
I will not share any details
as to the particulars of the case.

518
00:47:17,606 --> 00:47:19,858
Then why did you hold
this press conference?

519
00:47:19,941 --> 00:47:21,943
-Give us an explanation!
-Right!

520
00:47:22,027 --> 00:47:27,282
If you're not going to tell us anything,
how do we know your claims are true?

521
00:47:27,366 --> 00:47:28,408
-Yes!
-Exactly!

522
00:47:28,492 --> 00:47:30,786
Give a proper explanation!

523
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:34,122
I will now call upon Ms. Ioka,
representing Rafale,

524
00:47:34,206 --> 00:47:36,333
and Hirata, a Weekly Buncho reporter,

525
00:47:36,416 --> 00:47:39,670
to explain the purpose
of this press conference.

526
00:47:52,182 --> 00:47:54,142
I'm Ioka, CEO of Rafale.

527
00:47:55,102 --> 00:47:58,897
I have been investigating
Actor A's sexual assault allegations,

528
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,359
alongside Ms. Hirata, who is a reporter.

529
00:48:03,193 --> 00:48:05,612
But as was mentioned earlier,

530
00:48:05,696 --> 00:48:11,118
I decided that it was best not to share
the details of the investigation here.

531
00:48:12,786 --> 00:48:13,745
Nevertheless,

532
00:48:14,746 --> 00:48:17,124
I called upon you today

533
00:48:17,791 --> 00:48:22,129
to ask you to reexamine
what gets treated as truth

534
00:48:22,713 --> 00:48:25,048
in news reportings these days.

535
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:29,010
Weekly magazines, TV, and online news.

536
00:48:29,094 --> 00:48:32,389
Faced with a torrent
of information in various media,

537
00:48:32,472 --> 00:48:35,976
how can anyone be sure
whether that information is true?

538
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:39,604
I'll tell you how. It gets reported
because that's what the facts say!

539
00:48:39,688 --> 00:48:40,605
-Yes!
-Exactly!

540
00:48:40,689 --> 00:48:46,570
I agree that facts are indisputable,
but the truth is a different matter.

541
00:48:47,529 --> 00:48:51,116
That's because the truth
that the news media portrays

542
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,370
is fabricated by arbitrarily
omitting and twisting the facts.

543
00:48:56,121 --> 00:48:59,541
And at times, that fabricated truth…

544
00:49:01,626 --> 00:49:03,211
can take lives.

545
00:49:06,465 --> 00:49:10,343
Ms. Hirata over there is a reporter
for Weekly Buncho, right?

546
00:49:10,927 --> 00:49:14,473
What do you make
of Ms. Ioka's comments just now?

547
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,225
I share the same sentiment as her.

548
00:49:18,435 --> 00:49:23,690
Are you saying that you've been reporting
twisted versions of the truth until now?

549
00:49:24,566 --> 00:49:26,109
Perhaps I have.

550
00:49:28,945 --> 00:49:35,118
It's all too easy to twist the truth
to your liking in a magazine article,

551
00:49:35,744 --> 00:49:39,122
while avoiding responsibility
by keeping your name and face hidden.

552
00:49:40,081 --> 00:49:45,170
Today, we chose to avoid that
by speaking directly to you.

553
00:49:47,964 --> 00:49:51,176
Are you accusing us
of spreading fake news?

554
00:49:53,136 --> 00:49:56,389
Let me ask you then.
How many of you can swear

555
00:49:56,473 --> 00:49:59,643
that you've only ever
written factual information?

556
00:50:01,186 --> 00:50:03,480
Journalism provides
a great service to society

557
00:50:03,563 --> 00:50:07,943
by bringing concealed facts
to the public's attention,

558
00:50:08,026 --> 00:50:09,611
through magazines or otherwise.

559
00:50:09,694 --> 00:50:12,405
But there's a negative side to it too.

560
00:50:13,615 --> 00:50:17,285
I don't think it's controversial to state
that some amount of scandals

561
00:50:17,369 --> 00:50:21,039
are portrayed in a skewed manner
due to industry power dynamics.

562
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:27,754
Those with authority dilute the truth
and spread narratives of their liking.

563
00:50:27,838 --> 00:50:28,839
And sometimes,

564
00:50:28,922 --> 00:50:34,094
the news media itself manufactures a truth
that's more likely to stir up the public.

565
00:50:35,095 --> 00:50:37,347
People then believe
that manufactured truth

566
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:41,101
and use it as justification
to bring harm to others.

567
00:50:41,810 --> 00:50:44,688
Sometimes, even threatening their lives.

568
00:50:45,939 --> 00:50:48,942
Let's stop perpetuating this cycle.

569
00:50:50,068 --> 00:50:53,572
Do you have any proof
of such manipulation of information?

570
00:50:54,573 --> 00:50:57,200
For one example,
the higher-ups at Weekly Buncho

571
00:50:57,284 --> 00:50:59,953
were in a secret alliance
with a major talent agency,

572
00:51:00,036 --> 00:51:05,000
and suppressed an article on the
aforementioned sexual assault allegations.

573
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:07,294
Sir, did you know about this?

574
00:51:18,972 --> 00:51:20,015
In addition to that,

575
00:51:20,098 --> 00:51:24,811
this major talent agency ignored
the situation, despite being aware of it,

576
00:51:24,895 --> 00:51:27,731
and even tried
to cover it up using its influence.

577
00:51:27,814 --> 00:51:30,275
An inside source confirmed that to us.

578
00:51:31,735 --> 00:51:33,111
Was that you?

579
00:51:36,364 --> 00:51:40,201
Furthermore, as for why this incident
happened in the first place,

580
00:51:40,702 --> 00:51:46,416
I am of the opinion that an old-fashioned
and flawed management style is to blame.

581
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:54,883
While Actor A himself obviously deserves
punishment for his alleged sexual assault,

582
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:00,180
the victims of his assault
did not simply remain silent.

583
00:52:00,931 --> 00:52:06,811
They were robbed of their voice and forced
to live in fear, shame, and solitude.

584
00:52:08,355 --> 00:52:12,859
No matter how esteemed they may be
or how many fans they may have,

585
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:17,572
someone who tramples on another's dignity
doesn't deserve to stand on stage.

586
00:52:19,741 --> 00:52:23,370
I refuse to let Actor A
get away with what he's done.

587
00:52:24,412 --> 00:52:28,500
However, I believe there's more
that needs to be done.

588
00:52:29,709 --> 00:52:35,757
He is a product of the old system that
yet exists in the entertainment industry.

589
00:52:37,008 --> 00:52:42,931
The management was lenient on him due to
his status, and no one could condemn him.

590
00:52:44,015 --> 00:52:46,142
The women who fell victim to him

591
00:52:46,851 --> 00:52:50,855
were faced with the fear of losing their
careers if they stood up against him.

592
00:52:52,107 --> 00:52:57,570
He was allowed to roam free
and create even more victims.

593
00:52:58,613 --> 00:53:03,868
This incident could very well
be called a man-made tragedy,

594
00:53:04,494 --> 00:53:08,832
caused by the negligence
and irresponsibility of the industry.

595
00:53:09,499 --> 00:53:12,836
You used to be a part of
Kodama Productions before, didn't you?

596
00:53:12,919 --> 00:53:15,130
Why didn't you speak up back then?

597
00:53:15,213 --> 00:53:17,340
-Right!
-Answer that!

598
00:53:17,424 --> 00:53:18,842
It's as you say.

599
00:53:19,426 --> 00:53:22,387
I was once part of Kodama Productions.

600
00:53:23,471 --> 00:53:26,099
I can't deny that
I overlooked many issues,

601
00:53:26,182 --> 00:53:29,185
all to stay in line
with the agency's customs.

602
00:53:30,895 --> 00:53:33,356
I can't erase my past.

603
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:36,443
I share part of the responsibility.

604
00:53:38,778 --> 00:53:41,823
That's why I'm sitting here today.

605
00:53:43,116 --> 00:53:45,577
Nothing will change
just by wallowing in regret.

606
00:53:46,411 --> 00:53:50,081
There are systemic issues
that we need to put an end to.

607
00:53:51,207 --> 00:53:55,545
Favoritism, negligence,
success built on sacrificing others.

608
00:53:56,296 --> 00:54:00,467
We can't hand over such customs
to the next generation.

609
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:03,511
I believe that putting
an end to these customs

610
00:54:03,595 --> 00:54:08,767
is a duty borne by all of us,
but especially myself as a participant.

611
00:54:09,392 --> 00:54:11,436
This is how we take responsibility.

612
00:54:15,356 --> 00:54:20,278
I call for a third-party investigation
into the actor involved in this case.

613
00:54:20,361 --> 00:54:23,031
As well as the agency
he is affiliated with.

614
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:26,493
If the agency suffers
from systemic issues,

615
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,746
then I believe it should
be dissolved entirely.

616
00:54:29,829 --> 00:54:31,623
You don't know a thing.

617
00:54:32,373 --> 00:54:34,209
You don't know a thing!

618
00:54:34,793 --> 00:54:37,212
To hell with your preaching!

619
00:54:40,465 --> 00:54:41,841
Ioka is right!

620
00:54:42,592 --> 00:54:44,677
We have to take responsibility!

621
00:54:44,761 --> 00:54:46,012
Responsibility?

622
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:49,390
Why do I have to take responsibility?

623
00:54:51,017 --> 00:54:53,686
Ms. Yoko, what's going on
with this press conference?

624
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:55,105
Why haven't you stopped it?

625
00:54:55,188 --> 00:54:56,856
It's your job to--

626
00:54:58,691 --> 00:55:00,735
Who do you think you are?

627
00:55:01,569 --> 00:55:03,655
Whose fault do you think this is?

628
00:55:03,738 --> 00:55:04,572
Ma'am!

629
00:55:04,656 --> 00:55:08,118
The agency's been backed
into a corner because of you!

630
00:55:08,910 --> 00:55:11,830
It's your fault!

631
00:55:11,913 --> 00:55:13,957
It's your fault!

632
00:55:14,582 --> 00:55:18,795
Do you even know how hard
I've had to work?

633
00:55:19,379 --> 00:55:21,005
All because of you!

634
00:55:22,132 --> 00:55:26,094
-Do you have any idea what you did?!
-Ma'am. Please stop.

635
00:55:26,177 --> 00:55:27,804
Calm down!

636
00:55:27,887 --> 00:55:30,223
-Ma'am!
-It's all your fault!

637
00:55:34,936 --> 00:55:36,980
Issues with the agency's customs?

638
00:55:38,314 --> 00:55:40,525
Well, I didn't create them.

639
00:55:41,442 --> 00:55:42,610
My father did!

640
00:55:44,028 --> 00:55:46,114
I was trying to change them!

641
00:55:48,992 --> 00:55:50,827
Until this happened!

642
00:55:54,622 --> 00:55:58,793
It's true that you inherited
the company from Mr. Shigeru.

643
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:04,174
But you didn't try to change
the agency at its core.

644
00:56:05,675 --> 00:56:08,970
If they pulled in numbers
or were popular enough,

645
00:56:09,053 --> 00:56:11,681
you'd overlook any unreasonable behavior.

646
00:56:11,764 --> 00:56:13,391
And if something happened,

647
00:56:13,474 --> 00:56:17,979
you'd hire a reporter and bend the truth
to protect the talent's reputation.

648
00:56:18,479 --> 00:56:22,150
But we should have changed our ways.

649
00:56:23,026 --> 00:56:25,361
And if we couldn't,
we should have ended it.

650
00:56:29,699 --> 00:56:30,783
That was…

651
00:56:32,452 --> 00:56:34,746
Mr. Shigeru's final wish.

652
00:56:37,916 --> 00:56:40,335
The dissolution of Kodama Productions.

653
00:56:41,544 --> 00:56:45,215
That's what was in the will
that you kept hidden.

654
00:57:04,234 --> 00:57:06,569
The chairman knew that
the customs of Kodama Pro

655
00:57:06,653 --> 00:57:08,613
had fallen behind the times.

656
00:57:09,197 --> 00:57:10,740
I expect she'll be angry.

657
00:57:12,742 --> 00:57:14,160
Once she finds out.

658
00:57:14,244 --> 00:57:16,996
Why not tell her directly?

659
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:21,584
Do you really think she'll listen?

660
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,090
She takes after me.

661
00:57:30,093 --> 00:57:33,596
I could only ever teach her
the methods I knew myself.

662
00:57:42,397 --> 00:57:43,982
I'm leaving her…

663
00:57:46,818 --> 00:57:48,611
in your care.

664
00:57:56,619 --> 00:57:58,454
Screw that!

665
00:58:00,957 --> 00:58:03,126
How dare he act like that now?

666
00:58:08,131 --> 00:58:11,926
He never did anything fatherly for me.

667
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:18,600
He clung to the agency until the end…

668
00:58:20,476 --> 00:58:22,729
and died as if he was running away.

669
00:58:24,188 --> 00:58:26,941
And then he does this at the end?!

670
00:58:31,112 --> 00:58:32,488
Why have I…

671
00:58:38,244 --> 00:58:41,164
What have worked for all this time?

672
00:58:48,046 --> 00:58:49,213
Pardon me.

673
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:03,996
I came to this conference today
for the sake of someone dear to me,

674
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:10,044
and above all, to grant myself
an opportunity to move forward.

675
01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:12,839
Even if my voice is small,

676
01:00:12,922 --> 01:00:17,009
I wanted to let it be heard
instead of choosing silence.

677
01:00:18,428 --> 01:00:19,887
But now,

678
01:00:19,971 --> 01:00:25,977
I am certain that all the people in this
venue and those listening to us elsewhere,

679
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:30,314
have received our message loud and clear.

680
01:00:36,529 --> 01:00:41,117
I believe that at this very moment,
we are standing at a crossroads.

681
01:00:42,368 --> 01:00:48,916
We live in a time of great schism
between the old and new values.

682
01:00:50,835 --> 01:00:54,797
But I believe that it is
in that very chaos

683
01:00:54,881 --> 01:00:58,092
that true change can manifest.

684
01:01:00,595 --> 01:01:03,264
It takes courage to change.

685
01:01:04,974 --> 01:01:08,311
The act of speaking out
is accompanied by pain.

686
01:01:09,437 --> 01:01:11,981
But despite that…

687
01:01:13,316 --> 01:01:14,859
I want to believe.

688
01:01:16,402 --> 01:01:19,781
That we have the power to change.

689
01:01:22,241 --> 01:01:27,914
It is not someone else who will change,
but all of us individually.

690
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:31,876
Speak up.

691
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:33,961
Have doubts.

692
01:01:34,921 --> 01:01:37,298
Have empathy for the pain of others.

693
01:01:38,341 --> 01:01:42,470
That is what will help bring about change.

694
01:01:44,806 --> 01:01:45,932
The future…

695
01:01:46,933 --> 01:01:50,353
is not to be awaited, but to be created.

696
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:57,735
I hope that this moment can be the start…

697
01:02:00,029 --> 01:02:01,697
of that change.

698
01:03:13,144 --> 01:03:18,065
