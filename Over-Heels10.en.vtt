WEBVTT

00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:12.239
You're not Gyeon-U. You're Bong-su.

00:01:13.365 --> 00:01:15.826
Seong-A, you're scaring me.

00:01:16.494 --> 00:01:17.703
Bong-su.

00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:19.246
What happened to Gyeon-U?

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.708
Where is Gyeon-U?

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:29.632
Tell me how I can take over
his body completely.

00:01:30.508 --> 00:01:31.550
Get him tarnished by blood.

00:01:33.135 --> 00:01:34.595
Just draw blood

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:36.263
while around a ghost.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.071
It'll be perfect if it's a Suicide Ghost.

00:01:59.745 --> 00:02:00.663
I'm sorry.

00:02:05.793 --> 00:02:08.796
I need Newly-Dead to draw blood.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.008
Seong-A, we should go.

00:02:13.592 --> 00:02:14.844
Wait.

00:02:14.927 --> 00:02:15.886
Hey.

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:18.848
You said you'd protect her.

00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:20.724
You can't let her go
to a Suicide Ghost by herself.

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:22.184
-Hey.
-No, don't!

00:02:23.102 --> 00:02:24.270
Let go!

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.154
Gyeon-U.

00:02:37.116 --> 00:02:38.367
Gyeon-U!

00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:12.109
Gyeon-U. Are you okay?

00:03:18.574 --> 00:03:19.575
Yeah.

00:03:20.326 --> 00:03:21.243
I'm okay.

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:24.663
That's a relief.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.418
But…

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:37.593
You don't seem well.

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:38.636
What?

00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:45.267
Oh, you're right.

00:03:46.143 --> 00:03:47.186
You want my bike?

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.896
Yeah, just for the day.

00:03:50.481 --> 00:03:53.734
Seong-A's not well,
and I want to take her home.

00:03:54.526 --> 00:03:56.195
Really? Then I'll take her home.

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:57.655
No…

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:02.409
Just a moment, Seong-A.

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:04.745
-Hey!
-Damn it.

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.622
Hand it over when I ask nicely.

00:04:06.705 --> 00:04:09.249
-Kicking doesn't count as asking nicely.
-Oh, whatever!

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:10.668
Give me the bike!

00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:12.086
Stop it, Bong-su.

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.588
Gyeon-U, let's keep holding hands.

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:19.718
Ji-ho.

00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:23.138
Bong-su's way worse than you think he is.

00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:26.475
We don't know what he might do,
so hand it over to me…

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:29.103
I mean, to him.

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:35.359
Bye.

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:39.029
Right.

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:41.073
I'm a massive pushover.

00:04:54.044 --> 00:04:54.878
Let's go.

00:05:00.342 --> 00:05:01.343
Bong-su.

00:05:02.553 --> 00:05:04.013
Where is Gyeon-U?

00:05:05.264 --> 00:05:06.140
I…

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:10.394
devoured him.

00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:38.881
You said you'd curse me.

00:05:40.299 --> 00:05:42.926
You need an item of mine
to do that, remember?

00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:51.894
An item?

00:06:20.172 --> 00:06:21.590
I keep drinking,

00:06:23.634 --> 00:06:25.219
so why don't I feel drunk?

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.113
My poor friend.

00:07:09.138 --> 00:07:11.807
Don't pity me, friend.

00:07:50.137 --> 00:07:52.222
What are you doing? Looking for something?

00:07:58.228 --> 00:08:00.147
What did you do with the silver ring?

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:02.482
Did you return it to the owner?

00:08:03.275 --> 00:08:05.944
Why do you even care? It's not even yours.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:12.826
How does it feel

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:15.162
to have full control
over Newly-Dead's body?

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.498
Not so loud. She's asleep.

00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:22.294
Are you going somewhere?
Why are you dressed up?

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:24.755
I'll be back soon.

00:08:26.048 --> 00:08:27.382
What does that even mean?

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:29.176
Don't come back.

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:30.469
Don't.

00:08:42.898 --> 00:08:45.025
What is she plotting this time?

00:08:46.485 --> 00:08:47.569
I wonder.

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:07.839
Will you just let her be?

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:11.927
For now.

00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:14.721
I must know where she's flying to

00:09:14.805 --> 00:09:16.556
before setting a trap.

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:22.104
This Maetoe belonged
to Mount Gokma's Shaman Park.

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:25.565
Why do you want to smash
a haunted object so urgently?

00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:27.234
That was really hard to get.

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:29.611
You know how the rich
are always short on time.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:39.830
Let me see. One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight…

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.874
Thank you so much.

00:09:42.958 --> 00:09:45.043
Do you need anything else, madam?

00:09:45.127 --> 00:09:47.504
No. Good job.

00:09:47.963 --> 00:09:49.756
I see you reconciled with Dongcheon.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.216
That's hers.

00:09:51.717 --> 00:09:53.927
You bought it for her here ten years ago.

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:55.804
Mom.

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:57.723
This is just for you.

00:09:57.806 --> 00:09:58.974
Right?

00:09:59.057 --> 00:10:01.143
Butterflies suit you better.

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:02.561
Let's have a look.

00:10:03.312 --> 00:10:05.605
You look so pretty, Mom.

00:10:07.316 --> 00:10:10.485
You two were so adorable then.

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:16.783
Oh, my goodness. What's this?

00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:20.245
Why put a goblin's face
in a field of butterflies?

00:10:20.329 --> 00:10:21.830
Dongcheon did this, didn't she?

00:10:22.414 --> 00:10:24.458
My goodness…

00:10:24.541 --> 00:10:26.043
She really doesn't know fashion.

00:10:27.127 --> 00:10:29.338
The goblin's face
is said to ward off evil.

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:32.174
There must've been a ghost
she wanted to ward off.

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:37.095
Probably…

00:10:40.223 --> 00:10:41.058
a Butterfly Ghost.

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:49.191
I know I did wrong.

00:10:49.274 --> 00:10:51.026
But I don't want to give it back.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:53.028
Who told me how to take it?

00:10:53.612 --> 00:10:55.906
Yeomhwa did.
It's obvious what she's up to.

00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:58.492
She wants to kill Gyeon-U
and turn me into an evil deity.

00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:01.661
But to do that,

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:03.705
she needed me to claim Gyeon-U's body.

00:11:04.373 --> 00:11:05.499
So she told me right away.

00:11:06.083 --> 00:11:07.918
But that's all there is, okay?

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:10.545
I really am not in league with her.

00:11:10.629 --> 00:11:12.798
I want to live as a human.

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:14.466
Oh, what should we do about Yeomhwa?

00:11:14.549 --> 00:11:15.550
We'll stop her.

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:17.761
I've stopped her once already.

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:20.514
I was actually tied to an object,
not the abandoned house.

00:11:20.597 --> 00:11:23.183
As soon as she heard
I'd taken over this body,

00:11:23.266 --> 00:11:25.685
she came to ask me where the object was.

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.814
I didn't tell her.
Then she just changed the topic.

00:11:29.523 --> 00:11:31.191
I did use a pretty scary tone.

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:33.610
When I want to scare someone,
I'm do it properly.

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:38.240
I don't want to be an evil deity.
Do you now get where I stand?

00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.954
Say something, you old shaman.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.797
A haunted object.

00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:57.259
She was looking for that?

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:00.595
Yeomhwa

00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:03.682
is looking for an object
that was haunted by Bong-su.

00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:06.351
She plans to smash it

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:09.020
and summon the Grim Reaper.

00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:13.108
Since Bong-su is refusing
to leave Gyeon-U's body,

00:12:13.191 --> 00:12:16.486
she's trying to force Gyeon-U
to the other side.

00:12:17.904 --> 00:12:18.947
What should we do, then?

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.033
We must protect Bong-su.

00:12:24.202 --> 00:12:25.620
What about Gyeon-U?

00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:27.080
If the Grim Reaper gets him,

00:12:27.164 --> 00:12:29.040
Gyeon-U will be gone forever.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:31.835
Protecting Bong-su is the way
to protect Gyeon-U.

00:12:34.129 --> 00:12:36.882
Is there any other way?
Is there anything else we can do?

00:12:39.926 --> 00:12:42.137
He said he wanted to live as a human…

00:12:44.431 --> 00:12:46.141
and stay by your side.

00:12:46.224 --> 00:12:47.934
That's why he took Gyeon-U's body.

00:12:49.144 --> 00:12:50.687
To me, it sounded like

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:53.482
he wants to be loved.

00:12:56.485 --> 00:12:58.904
Try to really understand his cry for love.

00:12:58.987 --> 00:13:00.655
Don't just hate him blindly.

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:07.746
My dear daughter.
What is it that we shamans do?

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:16.171
We console spirits.

00:13:17.589 --> 00:13:18.798
That's right.

00:13:19.758 --> 00:13:22.427
Rites and amulets are a means.

00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:24.304
What's really important is in the heart.

00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:28.099
If you console a wounded heart,

00:13:28.183 --> 00:13:31.102
the rest will fall into place
as meant to be.

00:13:32.729 --> 00:13:33.647
But still,

00:13:35.106 --> 00:13:36.775
that will take so long.

00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:49.079
But that's the right path to follow.

00:14:15.105 --> 00:14:16.106
Hey.

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:20.860
How is that thing going?
I mean, finding a name.

00:14:21.528 --> 00:14:23.238
Did you find it?

00:14:24.072 --> 00:14:25.657
Why do you suddenly care?

00:14:26.324 --> 00:14:28.118
Did the old shaman say something?

00:14:31.663 --> 00:14:32.872
She just told me

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:34.666
to be kind to you.

00:14:35.458 --> 00:14:37.502
She said you should survive
for Gyeon-U to live.

00:14:42.966 --> 00:14:44.134
So you'll be kind to me?

00:14:45.594 --> 00:14:46.595
Yeah.

00:14:50.056 --> 00:14:52.183
How, exactly?

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:55.854
How will you be kind to me?

00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:02.527
I won't make you feel lonely.

00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:07.282
Loneliness can turn anyone into a ghost.

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:21.588
Gyeon-U, I'll get things back to normal.

00:15:22.881 --> 00:15:24.341
Until then,

00:15:25.383 --> 00:15:26.551
please stay safe.

00:15:36.895 --> 00:15:38.021
Hello?

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:40.815
Is anyone there?

00:15:43.693 --> 00:15:45.236
I don't know where I am,

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:47.280
and there's no path.

00:15:56.623 --> 00:15:57.791
Is someone crying?

00:16:07.342 --> 00:16:08.718
Hey.

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:12.389
What are you doing? Everyone's watching.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:14.974
You said you'd be kind to me.

00:16:18.853 --> 00:16:19.896
Are they dating?

00:16:23.358 --> 00:16:25.777
This is amazing.
It's like a sticky rice cake.

00:16:27.153 --> 00:16:28.154
You said you'd be kind to me.

00:16:37.622 --> 00:16:39.749
The perfect height to rest my chin.

00:16:39.833 --> 00:16:40.667
I like it.

00:16:41.459 --> 00:16:42.293
Are you two dating?

00:16:43.712 --> 00:16:45.964
No, it's one-sided on my part.
It's unrequited love.

00:16:46.047 --> 00:16:48.216
What are you even talking about?

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:49.259
Hey.

00:16:50.969 --> 00:16:53.304
Is Bong-su rubbing off on you
from being around him all the time?

00:16:53.388 --> 00:16:55.682
Get off her.
Why are you acting like Bong-su?

00:16:58.727 --> 00:16:59.853
Because I'm Bong-su.

00:17:00.437 --> 00:17:01.354
What?

00:17:01.438 --> 00:17:03.690
What part did you not get?
I'm Bong-su, punk.

00:17:06.317 --> 00:17:07.360
That's not fair.

00:17:07.444 --> 00:17:09.279
What about Gyeon-U? What about his life?

00:17:09.362 --> 00:17:11.322
Losing all senses to a ghost is very rare.

00:17:11.906 --> 00:17:13.575
Consoling Bong-su should be the priority.

00:17:13.658 --> 00:17:16.911
I'll start the 100-day prayer today.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.955
It takes that long?

00:17:20.498 --> 00:17:22.041
There's no guarantee
that will work either.

00:17:22.125 --> 00:17:24.919
If 100 days aren't enough,
I'll pray for another 200 or 300.

00:17:25.545 --> 00:17:27.547
I'll pray for and console him
until he moves on.

00:17:29.716 --> 00:17:31.301
I can't wait that long.

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:35.096
Hey. Get back inside when I ask nicely.
Bring Gyeon-U back out.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.432
How is this asking nicely
when you're pinning me here?

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:38.767
Cut it out!

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:40.977
Enough fooling around.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:46.232
Let me off.

00:17:46.316 --> 00:17:47.650
We're partners, after all.

00:17:49.152 --> 00:17:49.986
What?

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:51.154
I like you guys.

00:17:51.237 --> 00:17:52.572
I like the shaman.

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:54.824
I want to stay with her.

00:17:58.703 --> 00:18:00.663
But when I reach out to hold her,

00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:02.415
Gyeon-U comes back.

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:04.501
Let's go home, Seong-A.

00:18:05.585 --> 00:18:07.796
I can't help her up when she falls down.

00:18:08.505 --> 00:18:09.547
And even when she cries,

00:18:09.631 --> 00:18:11.216
I can't wipe away her tears.

00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:13.551
That's been…

00:18:14.803 --> 00:18:15.804
so painful.

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:18.431
Very.

00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:32.153
Should I offer
to pray with her for 100 days?

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:33.696
-Here we go!
-Like that will work.

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:35.448
Okay!

00:18:35.532 --> 00:18:37.408
Sa-rang, you're pathetic. You lost.

00:18:38.076 --> 00:18:39.702
-You didn't stand a chance.
-I let you win.

00:18:39.786 --> 00:18:40.912
-No.
-I let you off.

00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:41.996
Hey.

00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:46.042
Why? What?

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:48.878
-Where's Seong-A?
-What about Seong-A?

00:18:49.796 --> 00:18:50.839
I just…

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.717
Will you thank her for me

00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:56.719
for telling me about Bok-i?

00:18:57.887 --> 00:18:58.888
Why are you asking me…

00:18:58.972 --> 00:19:01.891
Tell her yourself.
I'm not in the mood to talk right now.

00:19:01.975 --> 00:19:03.142
I'm depressed.

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:04.644
I'm sad.

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:12.068
Hey! Don't pick on my friend!

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:13.403
What was that?

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.196
-That was Ju-seung.
-What?

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:17.115
Are you crazy?

00:19:17.198 --> 00:19:18.783
We're friends.

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:23.872
-Where is he?
-Who are you talking about?

00:19:23.955 --> 00:19:25.832
That Hwamok High guy from last time.

00:19:25.915 --> 00:19:26.749
Hey!

00:19:28.334 --> 00:19:29.210
Who's that?

00:20:03.661 --> 00:20:05.997
-Isn't that him?
-Come on.

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:10.209
What are you up to?

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:14.380
Can you throw a punch?

00:20:17.425 --> 00:20:18.343
Hey.

00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:20.637
-Hey, no, wait!
-Don't!

00:20:22.597 --> 00:20:24.807
Okay, fine.

00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:27.226
-You darn--
-Stop it.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:28.269
-Grab him!
-My gosh!

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:30.480
Why are you grabbing me? Why stop me?

00:20:31.397 --> 00:20:33.816
-Keep him here.
-Let go! Come at me!

00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:41.908
Guys.

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:43.576
Why did you stop me earlier?

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.078
I can fight.

00:20:45.161 --> 00:20:47.288
They can fight too.

00:20:49.123 --> 00:20:51.626
Why did you let them beat you up?

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:54.545
Jin-ung can't get into trouble right now.

00:20:55.296 --> 00:20:56.130
Why not?

00:20:56.214 --> 00:20:58.675
If he gets in trouble,
they'll call his parents.

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:00.635
He can't see his mom at the moment.

00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:04.847
Did she threaten to disown him?

00:21:04.931 --> 00:21:05.848
Don't.

00:21:06.391 --> 00:21:07.225
I must stay away

00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:10.311
to protect my mom

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:12.730
from my dad.

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:31.582
Let's go.

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:33.126
Let's go home.

00:22:01.612 --> 00:22:03.031
-Hey.
-What?

00:22:05.366 --> 00:22:06.367
Why are you back so late?

00:22:06.951 --> 00:22:09.162
I had lots to do. I was busy.

00:22:10.872 --> 00:22:12.582
You look very pretty today, as always.

00:22:13.833 --> 00:22:15.918
Don't be silly. Go back to the room.

00:22:17.628 --> 00:22:18.755
Wait.

00:22:18.838 --> 00:22:21.257
What's this? Is it blood?

00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.217
Yeah. I got into a fight.

00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:25.178
You did what?

00:22:25.261 --> 00:22:29.515
Hey, you can't fight in Gyeon-U's body.
Don't you know athletes shouldn't fight?

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:31.768
-If you were to get hurt--
-I won't fight.

00:22:33.978 --> 00:22:35.354
Shaman, do you know something?

00:22:36.147 --> 00:22:36.981
Know what?

00:22:38.232 --> 00:22:39.192
You are

00:22:40.777 --> 00:22:42.070
pretty even when you're angry.

00:22:42.153 --> 00:22:43.488
Why you…

00:22:44.864 --> 00:22:45.823
Hey!

00:22:48.159 --> 00:22:49.660
He's so annoying.

00:23:09.305 --> 00:23:11.933
Where did he go this time?

00:23:22.735 --> 00:23:25.446
He's hard at work early in the morning.

00:23:28.407 --> 00:23:31.160
-What's this?
-Were you at archery practice?

00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:32.954
Yes, I should train hard.

00:23:33.037 --> 00:23:35.289
Archery's everything to Bae Gyeon-U,
and he's damn good at it.

00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:38.042
Move. I'm exhausted.

00:23:47.969 --> 00:23:48.970
Hey.

00:23:49.053 --> 00:23:50.054
Give me that.

00:23:51.722 --> 00:23:53.683
How dare you help my girlfriend?

00:23:53.766 --> 00:23:55.351
-Hey.
-Hang on.

00:23:57.854 --> 00:23:58.813
Hey.

00:24:00.982 --> 00:24:02.650
Why? What?

00:24:04.402 --> 00:24:05.653
Just take this.

00:24:07.655 --> 00:24:09.448
Hey, I'm serious. It's so tasty.

00:24:09.532 --> 00:24:10.908
-This is just…
-What's wrong with him?

00:24:10.992 --> 00:24:12.869
Hey, thanks a lot.

00:24:13.578 --> 00:24:15.121
He says this is tasty.

00:24:15.204 --> 00:24:17.373
He got that excited over a lollipop?

00:24:17.456 --> 00:24:19.542
-He's like a kid.
-It's way nicer than yesterday's!

00:24:20.293 --> 00:24:21.335
What?

00:24:23.504 --> 00:24:25.715
It's so good. So sweet.

00:24:27.008 --> 00:24:28.759
You did get beaten up.

00:24:28.843 --> 00:24:31.012
What? No way.
I was man enough to let them hit me.

00:24:31.095 --> 00:24:32.722
-Like a real man.
-Guys, stop arguing.

00:24:33.347 --> 00:24:34.974
Let's arm-wrestle instead.

00:24:35.057 --> 00:24:36.475
-Come on.
-Arm-wrestling? Okay.

00:24:36.559 --> 00:24:38.728
Hey, partner.
Get over here and be the referee.

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:40.104
What for?

00:24:40.188 --> 00:24:41.105
You're the referee.

00:24:41.189 --> 00:24:42.857
-We play on three.
-Okay.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.734
One, two, three.

00:24:50.364 --> 00:24:51.824
Gyeon-U has changed, hasn't he?

00:24:51.908 --> 00:24:54.619
Yeah. He's become pretty charming.

00:24:54.702 --> 00:24:55.870
He looks more at ease.

00:24:55.953 --> 00:24:57.330
I'd like to be his friend.

00:24:57.413 --> 00:24:58.706
Shall we ask him out to coin karaoke?

00:24:58.789 --> 00:25:01.709
Why would you make him uncomfortable
when he's just starting to loosen up?

00:25:02.919 --> 00:25:05.129
Gyeon-U, do you want to
go to coin karaoke with me?

00:25:05.713 --> 00:25:06.547
Sure.

00:25:08.633 --> 00:25:09.884
What's the occasion, Gyeon-U?

00:25:09.967 --> 00:25:11.302
-Great.
-Not you.

00:25:11.385 --> 00:25:13.054
-Not me?
-You'll come too?

00:25:13.137 --> 00:25:14.347
-I'll…
-Let's just go.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:15.556
-Later on.
-Why on earth…

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.599
Everyone…

00:25:17.391 --> 00:25:18.893
seems to prefer

00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:21.270
Bong-su over Gyeon-U.

00:25:37.703 --> 00:25:39.956
You're wasting your time there. Geez.

00:25:44.252 --> 00:25:47.171
The face is the same,
so how are they so different?

00:25:49.632 --> 00:25:51.384
Because they're different people.

00:25:55.012 --> 00:25:57.056
It's not that I dislike Bong-su.

00:25:58.808 --> 00:26:02.436
But he does stuff
that Gyeon-U would never do.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:03.646
It's exhilarating, but…

00:26:04.772 --> 00:26:06.774
Oh, dear. He's growing on you.

00:26:09.485 --> 00:26:10.569
But…

00:26:12.154 --> 00:26:13.281
But…

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.452
No one knows that Gyeon-U isn't Gyeon-U.

00:26:20.246 --> 00:26:21.789
Only I know that.

00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:26.377
What if Gyeon-U fades away?

00:26:27.044 --> 00:26:30.089
What if he disappears from the world?

00:26:32.967 --> 00:26:35.261
I miss him so much.

00:26:36.387 --> 00:26:38.806
You can bring him forth and meet him.

00:26:38.889 --> 00:26:42.310
How can I see him when he's not here?

00:26:42.893 --> 00:26:44.812
Call on him during the Hour of the Ox.

00:26:44.895 --> 00:26:46.772
-What?
-That's the hour of ghosts.

00:26:50.443 --> 00:26:51.652
The Hour of the Ox.

00:26:58.951 --> 00:27:00.536
Gyeon-U.

00:27:02.204 --> 00:27:03.706
Gyeon-U. It's time to wake up.

00:27:05.916 --> 00:27:06.876
Gyeon-U.

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.691
Who's there?

00:27:33.027 --> 00:27:34.070
Who are you?

00:27:35.488 --> 00:27:36.322
Show yourself.

00:27:39.075 --> 00:27:39.950
Yoon-bo.

00:27:41.744 --> 00:27:42.578
It's me.

00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:46.457
Hey.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.583
Yoon-bo.

00:27:49.126 --> 00:27:51.379
Are you okay? You aren't hurt, are you?

00:27:51.462 --> 00:27:52.421
Gyeon-U.

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:55.216
Gyeon-U.

00:28:05.017 --> 00:28:06.435
Gyeon-U.

00:28:07.686 --> 00:28:08.521
Seong-A.

00:28:10.648 --> 00:28:12.108
Gyeon-U.

00:28:16.695 --> 00:28:18.572
Just now…

00:28:19.698 --> 00:28:22.118
I was in a mountain. What happened?

00:28:25.121 --> 00:28:26.747
That must have been a memory.

00:28:26.831 --> 00:28:29.834
A soul without a body resides in memories.

00:28:33.254 --> 00:28:36.465
So you want me to befriend the soldiers

00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:38.175
and listen to their stories?

00:28:41.011 --> 00:28:42.513
It's Bong-su's memory,

00:28:42.596 --> 00:28:44.306
so one of them must be Bong-su.

00:28:45.057 --> 00:28:46.058
Right?

00:28:46.142 --> 00:28:48.269
Yeah. We must find out
why Bong-su couldn't cross over

00:28:48.352 --> 00:28:50.104
and became a ghost.

00:28:50.187 --> 00:28:53.315
Only then it'll be easier to find a way
to console his soul.

00:28:55.818 --> 00:28:56.861
I'll give it a go.

00:29:01.323 --> 00:29:02.533
The Hour of the Ox is over.

00:29:08.831 --> 00:29:09.957
Hang in there.

00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:11.083
I'll be back soon.

00:29:15.129 --> 00:29:16.005
Okay.

00:29:16.589 --> 00:29:17.798
I'll be waiting.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:31.979
Lie down.

00:29:45.993 --> 00:29:46.827
Hello.

00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:48.829
Guys?

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:58.422
Befriending them won't be so easy.

00:30:17.483 --> 00:30:20.736
The evil spirit
definitely has the silver ring.

00:30:24.448 --> 00:30:26.200
How do I get it from him?

00:30:27.952 --> 00:30:30.204
You took every one of the amulets I wrote.

00:30:30.287 --> 00:30:32.206
Where are you, you witch?
I'll come to you.

00:30:32.289 --> 00:30:33.582
What's the evil spirit up to?

00:30:35.626 --> 00:30:37.419
Is he all you care about?

00:30:38.003 --> 00:30:41.298
He's having the time of his life,
and the others are stressed out.

00:30:41.382 --> 00:30:43.592
Heaven and Earth Fairy is having
a breakdown.

00:30:43.676 --> 00:30:45.970
She even forgot she could summon a ghost
at the Hour of the Ox.

00:30:47.513 --> 00:30:49.974
You reminded her,
so she must've summoned him.

00:30:50.057 --> 00:30:52.393
I guess? But why do you ask?

00:30:53.686 --> 00:30:55.020
She hung up on me.

00:30:56.689 --> 00:30:57.648
Yes.

00:30:59.817 --> 00:31:01.151
It's the heart

00:31:02.653 --> 00:31:04.029
that I must stir.

00:31:16.834 --> 00:31:19.378
Gyeon-U!

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.590
Come here.

00:31:24.383 --> 00:31:27.636
You'll enter the trial
to get on the national team!

00:31:29.138 --> 00:31:30.097
Jeez, cut it out.

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:32.308
What? The national team?

00:31:32.391 --> 00:31:34.810
You'll compete with our flag
on your chest and all that?

00:31:35.811 --> 00:31:37.938
I'm not on the team just yet.

00:31:38.022 --> 00:31:39.857
I will be soon, though.

00:31:40.983 --> 00:31:42.192
-No way.
-That's awesome.

00:31:42.693 --> 00:31:44.236
Can I get your autograph in advance?

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.405
-Sure, give it here.
-No, me first.

00:31:46.488 --> 00:31:47.990
Sign your name right here.

00:31:48.574 --> 00:31:49.533
I'm ticklish.

00:31:50.117 --> 00:31:51.535
You're so cool.

00:31:51.619 --> 00:31:52.870
You have a weird autograph.

00:31:55.914 --> 00:31:56.915
Hey, that looks cool.

00:31:56.999 --> 00:31:58.000
-Hey.
-Hey.

00:31:58.083 --> 00:32:00.169
-Just a moment. Hang on.
-Where are you going?

00:32:00.252 --> 00:32:02.004
THOSE WHO RISK THEIR LIVES WILL TRIUMPH

00:32:02.087 --> 00:32:02.921
Hey.

00:32:03.922 --> 00:32:04.798
What?

00:32:04.882 --> 00:32:06.967
Grant me a wish
if I make the national team.

00:32:07.051 --> 00:32:08.177
A wish?

00:32:08.969 --> 00:32:09.970
What's your wish?

00:32:14.308 --> 00:32:15.142
What?

00:32:15.225 --> 00:32:16.477
You and me.

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.522
You're really testing my patience here.

00:32:22.566 --> 00:32:23.859
What? Where are you going?

00:32:25.194 --> 00:32:27.780
I didn't say we should do it now.
I just told you what my wish was.

00:32:27.863 --> 00:32:29.156
I can't even say it?

00:32:29.239 --> 00:32:32.076
No, you can't.
Don't bring it up ever again.

00:32:32.159 --> 00:32:33.911
That's utter nonsense.

00:32:33.994 --> 00:32:36.038
What do you mean?

00:32:36.121 --> 00:32:38.540
I want to have my first kiss.
And I want to do it with you.

00:32:38.624 --> 00:32:41.377
That's the one thing
I desperately wish for.

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.046
What's so nonsensical
about saying what I want?

00:32:48.342 --> 00:32:51.220
I want to have my first kiss with Seong-A!

00:33:01.689 --> 00:33:02.523
Have you lost your mind?

00:33:06.318 --> 00:33:09.029
What's the issue?
Do you want to kiss the shaman too?

00:33:09.113 --> 00:33:11.365
Of course you do. Sorry for asking.

00:33:11.448 --> 00:33:12.574
Do you have a death wish?

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.618
Too bad.

00:33:15.285 --> 00:33:17.204
I'm hard to kill.

00:33:17.287 --> 00:33:18.872
Getting revived is my specialty.

00:33:24.128 --> 00:33:25.045
Here's what I think.

00:33:27.881 --> 00:33:29.341
If I keep on trying,

00:33:29.883 --> 00:33:32.428
she might care about me a little,
don't you think?

00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:39.143
I do have Gyeon-U's face
and body, don't I?

00:33:48.736 --> 00:33:49.570
FATHER

00:33:50.154 --> 00:33:50.988
Hey, Gyeon-U.

00:33:51.572 --> 00:33:53.490
Your father keeps calling.

00:33:53.574 --> 00:33:54.575
My father?

00:33:55.284 --> 00:33:56.368
Gyeon-U doesn't have a father.

00:34:21.226 --> 00:34:23.479
I've seen her before.

00:34:34.782 --> 00:34:37.618
She's that deadly scary shaman
who only has feeble powers.

00:34:38.827 --> 00:34:40.454
You used Gyeon-U's family?

00:34:40.537 --> 00:34:41.538
How crafty.

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.792
Right back at you.

00:34:45.542 --> 00:34:46.877
You have the silver ring.

00:34:47.753 --> 00:34:49.797
Didn't you become a ghost

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:52.049
because you didn't get to
return it to its owner?

00:34:52.132 --> 00:34:54.843
You said you'd return it
as soon as you possessed a body.

00:34:54.927 --> 00:34:56.261
Why do you still have it?

00:34:57.763 --> 00:34:59.389
I've been a bit busy.

00:35:01.183 --> 00:35:02.476
I have to get on the national team.

00:35:10.859 --> 00:35:13.320
You must be having a great time
pretending to be human.

00:35:13.403 --> 00:35:15.197
Yes, I am. It's fun.

00:35:15.948 --> 00:35:16.990
I plan on doing this for life.

00:35:19.034 --> 00:35:22.371
You're close to becoming an evil deity,
so you're too strong.

00:35:23.288 --> 00:35:24.665
You're unruly

00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:26.625
and hard to control.

00:35:28.627 --> 00:35:31.380
So I gave the matter some thought.

00:35:32.589 --> 00:35:33.966
"It's this hard for me,

00:35:34.591 --> 00:35:36.927
so it must be tormenting
for Heaven and Earth Fairy."

00:35:46.728 --> 00:35:49.189
Do you know that Newly-Dead can surface
during the Hour of the Ox?

00:35:54.027 --> 00:35:54.987
The Hour of the Ox?

00:35:56.613 --> 00:35:57.948
Who surfaces then?

00:36:00.784 --> 00:36:01.910
Bae Gyeon-U can do that?

00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:04.705
I knew it.

00:36:05.873 --> 00:36:06.874
You had no idea.

00:36:08.917 --> 00:36:12.004
Now that he's the ghost,
the Hour of the Ox is his time.

00:36:13.338 --> 00:36:14.798
Even I wouldn't tell you that.

00:36:15.382 --> 00:36:17.217
You're an evil spirit
who stole another's body.

00:36:17.801 --> 00:36:19.136
You could turn at any moment.

00:36:21.013 --> 00:36:22.222
So you want to be human?

00:36:23.181 --> 00:36:24.057
But why?

00:36:25.017 --> 00:36:26.018
It's not like anyone would

00:36:27.102 --> 00:36:28.812
love you if you became human.

00:36:31.732 --> 00:36:33.275
How frightening would it be

00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:36.111
to have something that isn't human

00:36:37.070 --> 00:36:38.822
keep on pretending to be one by her side?

00:37:12.314 --> 00:37:13.148
It's me.

00:37:13.231 --> 00:37:14.900
Make me an amulet.

00:37:14.983 --> 00:37:16.944
You're so weak
you can't make an amulet yourself,

00:37:17.027 --> 00:37:19.446
so why do you keep plotting things?

00:37:20.697 --> 00:37:21.657
Hey.

00:37:22.366 --> 00:37:24.284
Slow down a little, will you?

00:37:26.912 --> 00:37:28.455
Sure, I get that.

00:37:28.538 --> 00:37:30.499
Nothing is more important
to a mom than her child.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.668
What?

00:37:32.751 --> 00:37:34.002
You want me to hurry up?

00:37:36.755 --> 00:37:37.714
Okay.

00:37:41.802 --> 00:37:43.929
I don't usually make Ghoul-Making Amulets.

00:38:22.092 --> 00:38:23.135
What are you doing here?

00:38:29.933 --> 00:38:30.851
It's…

00:38:31.393 --> 00:38:32.310
It's nothing.

00:38:36.106 --> 00:38:37.190
Let's go.

00:38:39.943 --> 00:38:41.653
You're welcome at any time.

00:38:42.237 --> 00:38:43.363
I'll be waiting at the shack.

00:38:43.989 --> 00:38:44.823
Who are you?

00:38:45.991 --> 00:38:47.701
You must have no other friends

00:38:48.785 --> 00:38:50.120
if you're hanging out with him.

00:38:54.791 --> 00:38:57.335
Dang, that was scary.

00:38:57.419 --> 00:38:58.378
Who is she?

00:38:59.588 --> 00:39:00.756
She's no one important.

00:39:02.716 --> 00:39:03.550
Hey, wait up.

00:39:10.307 --> 00:39:12.893
Don't you want to know
how Heaven and Earth Fairy really feels?

00:39:14.102 --> 00:39:15.604
See for yourself.

00:39:44.132 --> 00:39:45.092
Gyeon-U.

00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:48.303
Gyeon-U, it's time to wake up.

00:39:50.138 --> 00:39:50.972
Gyeon-U.

00:39:55.852 --> 00:39:56.978
Gyeon-U.

00:40:25.257 --> 00:40:26.174
What's wrong?

00:40:26.675 --> 00:40:29.553
Why do you look so sad?

00:40:30.846 --> 00:40:31.847
Your eyes are full of sorrow.

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.521
I can't say.

00:40:40.605 --> 00:40:42.607
I guess I missed you a lot.

00:40:46.361 --> 00:40:47.279
So did I.

00:40:48.613 --> 00:40:50.657
I missed you so much too.

00:40:53.827 --> 00:40:55.787
How is it over there? Is it okay?

00:40:55.871 --> 00:40:58.540
Did you get to get closer to the soldiers?

00:40:58.623 --> 00:41:00.750
Do you know which of them is Bong-su?

00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:12.345
What's the matter?

00:41:13.847 --> 00:41:15.015
You guys aren't close yet?

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.437
That's okay.

00:41:21.521 --> 00:41:24.065
Still, I hope you get close to them soon

00:41:24.149 --> 00:41:26.776
so we can find a way
to help Bong-su cross over.

00:41:31.865 --> 00:41:33.617
Once we send Bong-su off,

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:35.994
you can come back to where you belong.

00:41:40.332 --> 00:41:41.416
Shaman.

00:41:52.385 --> 00:41:53.345
Shaman.

00:42:07.192 --> 00:42:08.151
Shaman.

00:42:13.031 --> 00:42:13.949
Bong-su.

00:42:42.143 --> 00:42:44.020
What's up with them?

00:42:50.902 --> 00:42:52.862
Attention. Bow to the teacher.

00:42:52.946 --> 00:42:54.781
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:42:55.448 --> 00:42:58.201
You only cheer up when the day is over.

00:42:59.703 --> 00:43:01.121
Who wants to go to the Internet café?

00:43:01.705 --> 00:43:03.456
-We should go.
-Internet café, anyone?

00:43:05.208 --> 00:43:07.836
-Pack up, quick.
-You too.

00:43:17.137 --> 00:43:18.054
What's going on?

00:43:18.138 --> 00:43:19.055
What's up?

00:43:19.139 --> 00:43:20.890
-He dragged her out.
-What's going on?

00:43:23.518 --> 00:43:25.770
Can't the school just ban dating?

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:28.356
I can't breathe. It's suffocating.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.357
You'll hurt her hand.

00:43:31.568 --> 00:43:33.445
We're here. I was about to let go.

00:43:34.779 --> 00:43:35.905
Why are we here?

00:43:40.452 --> 00:43:41.328
YOUNG SOULS OF HWAMOK!
REST IN PEACE

00:43:41.411 --> 00:43:43.955
The name I was looking for is right here.

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:47.250
Out of the two student soldiers,

00:43:48.209 --> 00:43:49.210
I was the tall one.

00:43:49.836 --> 00:43:50.879
And the short kid

00:43:52.422 --> 00:43:53.506
was Jang Yoon-bo.

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:55.592
When Yoon-bo died,

00:43:55.675 --> 00:43:57.510
he asked me to send home

00:43:57.594 --> 00:43:59.846
the silver ring his mom had given him.

00:44:01.431 --> 00:44:04.434
But I died before I could do that,
and that regret has plagued me.

00:44:06.936 --> 00:44:08.021
That's why I became a ghost.

00:44:15.653 --> 00:44:16.654
JANG YOON-BO

00:44:44.516 --> 00:44:45.558
Now that I've done this,

00:44:47.268 --> 00:44:48.853
it should help me overcome my regret.

00:44:49.771 --> 00:44:50.688
Bong-su.

00:44:50.772 --> 00:44:52.732
My regret is resolved,
so I'm done being Bong-su.

00:44:54.192 --> 00:44:55.193
I'll live as Bae Gyeon-U.

00:44:58.196 --> 00:44:59.656
Then what about the real Gyeon-U?

00:45:01.241 --> 00:45:02.075
Bae Gyeon-U?

00:45:03.451 --> 00:45:06.871
He's already a ghost
who can only appear at the Hour of the Ox.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:09.916
Let's go home now.

00:45:10.959 --> 00:45:12.877
No, wait.

00:45:13.336 --> 00:45:15.088
-Hey.
-You're hurting her!

00:45:23.221 --> 00:45:24.222
I'm hurting too.

00:45:29.352 --> 00:45:30.395
I…

00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:32.230
I'm hurting just the same.

00:45:45.535 --> 00:45:46.578
Hello.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.079
Where's the amulet?

00:45:48.163 --> 00:45:49.914
You're too impatient.

00:45:49.998 --> 00:45:52.083
Dear friend, do you even stop to breathe?

00:45:53.835 --> 00:45:55.920
Why do I smell cheonggukjang?

00:45:56.004 --> 00:45:56.838
Where's the amulet?

00:45:57.922 --> 00:45:59.132
It's over there.

00:46:09.184 --> 00:46:10.018
What are you doing?

00:46:10.101 --> 00:46:11.311
Friend.

00:46:11.394 --> 00:46:12.228
I'm sorry.

00:46:39.088 --> 00:46:40.089
Untie me right away.

00:46:41.174 --> 00:46:43.801
Even a daredevil like yourself
should know better

00:46:44.594 --> 00:46:47.055
than to consider
summoning the Grim Reaper.

00:46:47.514 --> 00:46:50.892
A Grim Reaper without a list
is no better than a murderer.

00:46:51.518 --> 00:46:54.521
They can kill whoever
and however many they want.

00:46:54.604 --> 00:46:57.774
Even evil spirits
avoid Grim Reapers with no list.

00:46:58.525 --> 00:47:00.944
However desperate you are,
you must not do this.

00:47:01.027 --> 00:47:02.195
So what?

00:47:02.820 --> 00:47:04.072
What are you going to do now?

00:47:04.155 --> 00:47:06.241
I'm going to remove
that petty ghost stuck to you

00:47:06.324 --> 00:47:08.451
pretending to be your patron deity.

00:47:09.118 --> 00:47:09.953
I'll get rid of it.

00:47:15.041 --> 00:47:15.959
No.

00:47:16.668 --> 00:47:18.002
You can't.

00:47:18.086 --> 00:47:19.170
No!

00:47:20.755 --> 00:47:22.048
No.

00:47:22.632 --> 00:47:23.466
Don't.

00:47:24.509 --> 00:47:26.219
Don't do it, okay?

00:47:26.928 --> 00:47:28.471
You can't do it. Don't!

00:47:29.347 --> 00:47:30.640
Don't do that.

00:47:31.224 --> 00:47:33.142
I beg of you. Please don't do it.

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:35.728
No. Don't do it!

00:47:35.812 --> 00:47:37.105
It's time for you

00:47:37.897 --> 00:47:39.148
to stop being a shaman.

00:47:39.232 --> 00:47:40.692
Don't.

00:47:40.775 --> 00:47:41.859
No, don't do it.

00:47:41.943 --> 00:47:43.111
Don't!

00:47:43.194 --> 00:47:44.237
No, don't.

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.572
Don't do it.

00:47:46.781 --> 00:47:47.740
Don't…

00:48:09.846 --> 00:48:13.016
I helped you out because you asked me to,

00:48:13.099 --> 00:48:15.184
but she has gone too far.

00:48:15.268 --> 00:48:17.770
Letting her go might be better
for both you and her.

00:48:19.897 --> 00:48:21.566
She won't come around.

00:48:24.819 --> 00:48:27.113
I'm not holding on to her
to make her come around.

00:48:28.948 --> 00:48:30.033
Then what?

00:48:30.617 --> 00:48:32.076
I'm copying her.

00:48:32.702 --> 00:48:34.704
She won't give up on her child,

00:48:35.455 --> 00:48:37.040
so how can I give up on her, my child?

00:48:39.417 --> 00:48:41.711
I'll go as far as she goes.

00:48:43.838 --> 00:48:46.299
Even if she crosses the line?

00:48:48.176 --> 00:48:49.052
I'll still follow her.

00:48:58.519 --> 00:49:00.897
She rendered me powerless yet again.

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:03.566
What about my baby?

00:49:06.569 --> 00:49:08.029
What about my baby?

00:49:09.989 --> 00:49:11.282
Does she fear the Grim Reapers…

00:49:13.534 --> 00:49:14.911
and evil spirits?

00:49:17.622 --> 00:49:18.748
She's wrong there.

00:49:19.332 --> 00:49:21.417
She should fear me the most.

00:49:24.045 --> 00:49:25.338
I'm a mom who lost her child.

00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:42.980
So what if I lost my patron deity?

00:49:44.649 --> 00:49:48.528
There are random ghosts
to replace it everywhere.

00:50:17.724 --> 00:50:19.434
Can Gyeon-U really never come back?

00:50:20.226 --> 00:50:22.353
If Bong-su decides to live as Gyeon-U,

00:50:22.437 --> 00:50:26.441
does Gyeon-U have to give up his body
without a chance to fight back?

00:50:30.987 --> 00:50:32.113
I guess so.

00:50:37.869 --> 00:50:39.912
I have another solution, though.

00:50:42.957 --> 00:50:43.958
Another solution?

00:50:45.209 --> 00:50:48.087
Other shamans can only console
the spirits,

00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.965
but I know how to scold them.

00:50:55.595 --> 00:50:56.721
You'll quit archery?

00:50:57.346 --> 00:50:59.599
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:50:59.682 --> 00:51:00.767
I quit.

00:51:00.850 --> 00:51:02.310
It's no fun.

00:51:02.393 --> 00:51:04.479
What about the national team
or the Olympic Games?

00:51:04.562 --> 00:51:06.189
If you want that so badly,

00:51:06.272 --> 00:51:08.733
train and compete yourself!

00:51:08.816 --> 00:51:10.568
-You brat, how dare you--
-Whatever!

00:51:17.366 --> 00:51:18.493
-Screw this!
-Stop right there!

00:51:18.576 --> 00:51:19.827
No!

00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:25.500
Archery is Gyeon-U's dream.

00:51:25.583 --> 00:51:27.293
Who are you to give up on his dream?

00:51:27.376 --> 00:51:28.795
I'm Bae Gyeon-U.

00:51:28.878 --> 00:51:31.297
Me, the person standing here
is Bae Gyeon-U.

00:51:31.798 --> 00:51:34.592
Why do you care
when I'm giving up on my own dream?

00:51:34.675 --> 00:51:35.927
You're not Gyeon-U. You're Bong-su.

00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:38.012
Don't call me "Bong-su," damn it!

00:51:39.639 --> 00:51:41.557
That's not my real name anyway.

00:51:42.475 --> 00:51:44.519
You made up that name as you pleased.

00:51:45.019 --> 00:51:47.522
I won't go by a shoddy name
someone made up on the spot.

00:51:47.605 --> 00:51:50.274
If you're not going to
address me as Gyeon-U,

00:51:50.358 --> 00:51:52.276
don't even talk to me. Got it?

00:51:57.490 --> 00:51:59.659
I have another solution, though.

00:52:05.748 --> 00:52:08.334
The evil spirit has this silver ring.

00:52:13.881 --> 00:52:15.132
Bring it to me.

00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.885
Then, the evil spirit will perish.

00:52:22.473 --> 00:52:24.559
No, stop it.

00:52:24.642 --> 00:52:25.601
Don't do that.

00:52:25.685 --> 00:52:27.937
Don't. Stop doing that.

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:28.896
Move!

00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:31.649
Why won't you let me throw out my things?

00:52:31.732 --> 00:52:32.817
Who do you think you are?

00:52:51.502 --> 00:52:52.336
Thank you.

00:52:53.004 --> 00:52:54.755
What will you do with that?

00:52:58.217 --> 00:53:00.928
You should've asked that
before you gave me the ring.

00:53:01.304 --> 00:53:02.138
Goodbye.

00:53:10.563 --> 00:53:11.397
Wait.

00:53:14.442 --> 00:53:15.902
Excuse me.

00:53:17.069 --> 00:53:18.070
Hey!

00:53:36.923 --> 00:53:37.840
Darn it.

00:53:40.676 --> 00:53:41.552
PYO JI-HO

00:53:41.636 --> 00:53:42.720
What's this?

00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:48.434
Hey, Seong-A. What do I do?

00:53:48.517 --> 00:53:50.311
I think I messed up.

00:53:50.394 --> 00:53:51.771
Hey.

00:53:51.854 --> 00:53:54.065
Are you okay? Bong-su.

00:53:55.483 --> 00:53:57.026
Bong-su!

00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:58.402
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

00:53:58.486 --> 00:54:01.030
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.
May it be done immediately.

00:54:01.113 --> 00:54:02.740
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

00:54:02.823 --> 00:54:05.451
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.
May it be done immediately.

00:54:05.534 --> 00:54:07.662
…Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

00:54:07.745 --> 00:54:09.121
May it be done immediately.

00:54:09.205 --> 00:54:11.457
Stop it! It hurts!

00:54:15.503 --> 00:54:19.632
Now that she has the haunted object,
Yeomhwa will summon the Grim Reaper.

00:54:20.591 --> 00:54:22.551
Let's distract the Grim Reaper.

00:54:23.427 --> 00:54:26.514
I'll set up a boundary
and hide Bong-su's location.

00:54:26.597 --> 00:54:28.766
Seong-A, you can go
to where the ring was buried

00:54:28.849 --> 00:54:30.059
and perform a rite.

00:54:30.142 --> 00:54:31.227
YOUNG SOULS OF HWAMOK!

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:33.020
I will hide him here,

00:54:33.104 --> 00:54:35.231
and you can protect him
with a rite from over there.

00:54:35.815 --> 00:54:38.985
We'll lure the Grim Reaper
to the wrong place.

00:54:46.117 --> 00:54:48.411
We're holding a rite to console
the lost souls. Please step back.

00:54:48.494 --> 00:54:50.079
Shoo.

00:54:51.163 --> 00:54:53.457
BAE GYEON-U, BORN IN 2007

00:54:53.541 --> 00:54:55.835
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

00:54:55.918 --> 00:54:57.211
Vanquish all spirits,

00:54:58.379 --> 00:55:00.339
wicked and evil.
May it be done immediately.

00:55:01.799 --> 00:55:03.634
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

00:55:03.718 --> 00:55:06.220
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

00:55:06.303 --> 00:55:07.680
May it be done immediately.

00:55:08.431 --> 00:55:09.765
May the pure sun shield us from harm.

00:55:09.849 --> 00:55:12.393
Protect us and allow us peace.
May it be done immediately.

00:55:13.102 --> 00:55:15.896
May the pure sun shield us from harm.
Protect us and allow us peace.

00:55:16.397 --> 00:55:19.567
May the pure sun shield us from harm.
Protect us and allow us peace.

00:55:19.650 --> 00:55:23.237
May the pure sun shield us from harm.
Protect us and allow us peace.

00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.072
May the pure sun shield us from harm.
Protect us and allow us peace.

00:55:25.156 --> 00:55:26.157
BAE GYEON-U

00:55:30.786 --> 00:55:31.954
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

00:55:32.038 --> 00:55:34.248
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

00:55:34.331 --> 00:55:35.499
May it be done immediately.

00:55:35.583 --> 00:55:36.751
Protect us and allow us peace.

00:55:36.834 --> 00:55:38.627
-May the pure sun shield us from harm.
-Hey!

00:55:38.711 --> 00:55:40.046
-Protect us and allow us peace.
-Look.

00:55:40.129 --> 00:55:41.338
A Grim Reaper's right there!

00:55:41.422 --> 00:55:42.465
-Close your eyes!
-Hey!

00:55:42.548 --> 00:55:43.507
Ma'am.

00:55:44.633 --> 00:55:47.094
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

00:55:47.178 --> 00:55:48.596
May it be done immediately.

00:55:48.679 --> 00:55:50.723
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits…

00:55:50.806 --> 00:55:52.808
MUST LIVE

00:55:52.892 --> 00:55:55.311
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

00:55:55.394 --> 00:55:59.065
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.
May it be done immediately.

00:55:59.732 --> 00:56:01.776
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

00:56:10.076 --> 00:56:10.910
BAE GYEON-U, BORN IN 2007

00:56:10.993 --> 00:56:13.746
May the pure sun shield us from harm.
Protect us and allow us peace.

00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:15.081
May it be done immediately.

00:56:15.164 --> 00:56:16.457
May it be done immediately.

00:56:19.168 --> 00:56:20.795
It worked.

00:56:20.878 --> 00:56:21.712
Let's go.

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:26.175
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirit…

00:56:40.439 --> 00:56:41.357
Hey!

00:56:42.066 --> 00:56:42.900
Hey, you!

00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:56.247
May it be done immediately.

00:57:02.795 --> 00:57:03.712
Why…

00:57:07.174 --> 00:57:09.051
Why should I suffer such pain?

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.222
I just want to live.

00:57:14.265 --> 00:57:16.308
I just want to live, that's all.

00:57:26.652 --> 00:57:29.446
"If a living person became a ghost
because they hated the world

00:57:29.530 --> 00:57:31.031
and cursed people,

00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.075
fear them."

00:57:33.159 --> 00:57:35.202
"They can use a spell to vanquish evil

00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:37.872
to vanquish you just the same."

00:57:44.503 --> 00:57:45.546
The one who should die

00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:47.214
is Yeomhwa.

00:57:48.507 --> 00:57:50.718
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

00:57:50.801 --> 00:57:53.053
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

00:57:53.554 --> 00:57:56.307
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

00:57:56.807 --> 00:57:59.602
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

00:57:59.685 --> 00:58:01.645
May it be done immediately.

00:58:01.729 --> 00:58:03.647
May it be done immediately.

00:58:06.942 --> 00:58:09.695
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits

00:58:09.778 --> 00:58:11.530
wicked and evil.
May it be done immediately.

00:58:11.614 --> 00:58:14.116
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits…

00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:15.326
Who is it?

00:58:16.911 --> 00:58:17.912
Who is it?

00:58:18.662 --> 00:58:19.914
Who is counter-cursing me?

00:58:19.997 --> 00:58:22.666
-I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
-I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:23.667
Who is it?

00:58:24.210 --> 00:58:26.629
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

00:58:26.712 --> 00:58:29.465
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.
Vanquish all spirits wicked and evil.

00:58:41.894 --> 00:58:42.728
Something went wrong.

00:58:45.648 --> 00:58:47.316
The Grim Reaper left.

00:58:51.862 --> 00:58:52.696
No.

00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.532
-I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell!
-I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell!

00:58:55.616 --> 00:58:56.700
-Vanquish all spirits…
-Vanquish all spirits…

00:58:57.284 --> 00:58:58.285
No.

00:59:00.955 --> 00:59:03.624
I can't die like this!

00:59:03.707 --> 00:59:05.334
I won't die like this.

00:59:07.586 --> 00:59:08.921
I never got to see my baby.

00:59:10.673 --> 00:59:12.299
Come to mommy.

00:59:15.261 --> 00:59:17.137
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell.

00:59:18.389 --> 00:59:19.473
Vanquish all spirits…

00:59:19.556 --> 00:59:22.434
-May it be done immediately.
-May it be done immediately.

00:59:22.518 --> 00:59:24.520
I summon you, Grim Reaper of Hell…

00:59:57.177 --> 00:59:59.346
The goblin's face
is said to ward off evil.

01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:01.807
"The Human Amulet method

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:04.685
allows a person
to protect another as an amulet."

01:00:05.811 --> 01:00:09.356
"Give something with eyes, a nose,
and lips as your stand-in."

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.400
"Even if you are not there,

01:00:11.483 --> 01:00:12.818
you can protect them."

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:42.389
"Even if you are not there…

01:00:48.228 --> 01:00:49.772
you can protect them."

01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:58.739
Mother!

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:05.954
No, Mother.

01:01:42.074 --> 01:01:43.158
Why?

01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:45.035
Why on earth did you do it?

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:53.252
I knew you would go all the way.

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:55.170
So, I decided

01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:58.132
to wait for you at the end this time.

01:01:58.924 --> 01:01:59.800
Why…

01:02:02.261 --> 01:02:03.220
Why would you

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:06.056
cling to a wretch like me
and end up like this?

01:02:07.850 --> 01:02:08.976
Didn't I tell you

01:02:10.686 --> 01:02:12.312
I wouldn't let you go?

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:35.544
Mom.

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:37.254
Mom.

01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:41.675
Mom!

01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:49.099
Mom…

01:02:52.186 --> 01:02:54.104
Mom…

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:35.020
To eliminate the evil deity,
Heaven and Earth Fairy

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:36.063
has to die.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:38.774
She has no idea
what she's doing right now.

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:41.193
Will you do me a favor?

01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:42.110
Let's go on our date.

01:03:42.194 --> 01:03:43.195
She knows.

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:44.821
She knows everything.

01:03:44.905 --> 01:03:47.074
I'll come back
before the graduation ceremony.

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:49.576
The shaman is dead.

01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:51.078
Seong-A isn't dead.

01:03:51.787 --> 01:03:53.413
Seong-A. Wait.

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:54.957
I'll come to you this time.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.333
I'll kill her if I find her.

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:57.584
Would he cooperate?

01:03:57.668 --> 01:03:58.502
Go!

01:03:58.585 --> 01:03:59.545
Go on, Seong-A!

01:04:06.051 --> 01:04:09.054
