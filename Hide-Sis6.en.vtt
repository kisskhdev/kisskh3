WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.728
They betrayed me.

00:01.980 --> 00:04.528
How could you do this to your sister?

00:04.712 --> 00:06.432
Shouldn’t come here.

00:07.650 --> 00:09.176
But you came.

00:09.420 --> 00:11.168
The only person I’ll trust

00:11.530 --> 00:13.000
is me.

00:25.544 --> 00:27.304
(Are sisters friends, )

00:27.320 --> 00:28.904
(attachments, )

00:31.940 --> 00:34.384
(or enemies given by parents?)

00:36.552 --> 00:40.264
(Being the oldest sister is a duty, )

00:40.870 --> 00:42.272
(a responsibility, )

00:44.770 --> 00:47.544
From now on, do it for yourself.

00:48.060 --> 00:49.660
Don’t do things for anyone else anymore.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.888
(and a burden that’s too heavy to bear.)

00:57.140 --> 00:59.864
(Since you don’t get to carry all these like I do, )

01:01.740 --> 01:04.064
(then don’t you dare judge me.)

02:16.060 --> 02:17.360
10 HOURS AGO

02:17.392 --> 02:19.620
Will you stay here for long, Miss Bua?

02:20.104 --> 02:21.432
Hmm…

02:22.700 --> 02:24.464
I’m still not sure.

02:24.896 --> 02:27.552
Probably until the things about the Farm

02:27.576 --> 02:29.328
and Chatfah are sorted out.

02:34.170 --> 02:35.296
Aunty Chom.

02:39.570 --> 02:41.272
You’ve heard about what the police found

02:41.296 --> 02:43.152
at the farm already, right?

02:45.940 --> 02:48.000
I don’t quite know about the details

02:48.580 --> 02:51.416
but I think that body was probably someone

02:51.464 --> 02:53.980
who have been working at the farm for a long time.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.392
Probably since I was young.

02:59.180 --> 03:00.776
Do you happen to know

03:02.160 --> 03:04.936
if anyone has disappeared mysteriously before?

03:05.660 --> 03:06.896
Back in the days,

03:06.928 --> 03:09.216
this area was not so developed.

03:09.256 --> 03:13.840
No one notices people coming or leaving.

03:13.872 --> 03:16.536
Then what about a case?

03:17.120 --> 03:18.120
Say…

03:18.750 --> 03:21.088
Has anyone fought with Dad

03:22.010 --> 03:24.440
or Uncle Kajorn before?

03:24.496 --> 03:26.056
About the past,

03:27.170 --> 03:29.400
I have forgotten about them already.

03:29.880 --> 03:31.688
Memories,

03:31.728 --> 03:33.160
they tend to trick us.

03:33.580 --> 03:37.328
Sometimes, things that we’ve always believed

03:37.360 --> 03:40.296
might be just something in our heads

03:40.320 --> 03:41.976
and not the truth.

03:42.580 --> 03:44.400
I’ve never asked you

03:45.380 --> 03:47.856
how long you have been working here.

03:49.152 --> 03:51.150
Is it even before I was born?

03:51.870 --> 03:53.680
Before you were born.

03:55.170 --> 03:57.576
And before Miss Pimol came in.

04:01.320 --> 04:04.768
I owe a lot to Mr. Asok.

04:06.170 --> 04:08.952
I promised him

04:09.440 --> 04:13.248
to love and be loyal to Mr. Asok

04:13.304 --> 04:15.496
and his family.

04:16.016 --> 04:18.320
I will not let anyone

04:18.360 --> 04:21.928
trample on what used to be Mr. Asok’s at all costs.

04:22.510 --> 04:24.824
You can trust in me, Miss Bua.

04:54.144 --> 04:56.808
* NO CONNECTION AS FATHER AND CHILD *
RESULTS OF DNA PATERNITY TEST

05:34.160 --> 05:36.376
As I’ve mentioned earlier

05:36.400 --> 05:38.992
about the new breed of our orchid.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.456
As a result, for this semester,

05:41.488 --> 05:43.460
we’re fully booked

05:43.490 --> 05:46.880
by the orders from skincare companies.

05:47.990 --> 05:49.704
If something happens to me,

05:50.600 --> 05:53.112
You and your sisters won’t get off the hook either.

05:53.580 --> 05:54.920
The body that they found,

05:56.460 --> 05:59.080
it might not be the only secret in our family.

06:00.020 --> 06:02.792
If it comes to a project under Mr. Kajorn,

06:02.816 --> 06:04.152
we're resting assured.

06:05.540 --> 06:06.540
Thank you so much.

06:07.080 --> 06:07.920
Uh…

06:07.960 --> 06:10.440
I'm not sure if I'm mistaken

06:10.472 --> 06:11.568
but this project

06:11.616 --> 06:15.304
was actually my Dad’s idea.

06:17.120 --> 06:19.664
But without Mr. Kajorn’s ability

06:19.688 --> 06:21.000
to take it to a further step,

06:21.420 --> 06:23.160
then it wouldn’t have come this far.

06:23.660 --> 06:25.064
Actually,

06:25.088 --> 06:28.312
it’s not that I’m not impressed with the figures or anything.

06:29.330 --> 06:30.480
But right now,

06:31.050 --> 06:32.864
our pressing agenda should be

06:34.384 --> 06:38.190
that a body was found at our farm.

06:39.552 --> 06:42.580
About that, the PR department is taking care of it.

06:43.340 --> 06:44.232
Since when?

06:44.264 --> 06:45.544
I didn’t know about that.

06:46.370 --> 06:48.872
Well, I sent the command

06:48.904 --> 06:50.304
as soon as I heard about the issue.

06:50.824 --> 06:52.820
But we have something more important.

06:55.060 --> 07:00.312
I'd like you all to have a read of this document

07:00.344 --> 07:03.256
and please sign the consensus.

07:08.590 --> 07:12.656
To prevent misinformation

07:12.680 --> 07:14.880
which could impact the company.
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

07:15.610 --> 07:19.160
I believe we should have a mutual agreement

07:21.830 --> 07:23.504
including your sisters.

07:24.690 --> 07:27.048
Do you not trust us that much?

07:32.250 --> 07:34.456
Judging from things I’ve seen so far,

07:35.480 --> 07:36.952
the answer is

07:38.170 --> 07:39.176
probably yes.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.008
What you did

07:49.340 --> 07:50.936
is like throwing me and my sisters under the bus

07:50.960 --> 07:52.760
in front of the board of directors.

07:53.260 --> 07:56.040
Let’s say that I know you guys well.

07:56.072 --> 07:57.912
If my sister were to work here,

07:57.936 --> 07:59.910
no one would take them seriously.

07:59.936 --> 08:00.912
Wait a second,

08:00.936 --> 08:02.168
do you really think that

08:02.192 --> 08:04.256
our sisters would get to run this company?

08:04.296 --> 08:05.296
Which one?

08:05.704 --> 08:07.704
The one with her nude video being released all over the internet.

08:07.728 --> 08:09.544
The one who has just disappeared.

08:10.256 --> 08:11.512
Or…

08:12.160 --> 08:15.104
the one who doesn’t even dare speak up to fight for herself?

08:15.760 --> 08:16.928
Uncle Kajorn.

08:18.230 --> 08:19.976
If you don’t sign it,

08:20.000 --> 08:21.980
that’s when things would seem incredible.

08:26.696 --> 08:27.928
You’re doing this

08:29.020 --> 08:31.152
because you’re trying to nitpick us, right?

08:32.620 --> 08:34.240
So that if we breach the agreement,

08:34.264 --> 08:36.360
you would be able to get rid of us easily, right?

08:36.744 --> 08:38.360
Then just don’t breach the agreement.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.640
You’re just like what Mom said.

08:43.380 --> 08:44.712
You can’t be trusted.

08:45.920 --> 08:46.920
Again.

08:47.570 --> 08:48.656
“What Mom said”, again.

08:50.090 --> 08:51.632
Do you think that woman

08:52.550 --> 08:53.952
can really be trusted?

09:02.830 --> 09:04.096
I understand.

09:05.140 --> 09:09.680
All children see their parents as heroes.

09:10.650 --> 09:11.968
But when you grow up,

09:12.608 --> 09:14.664
you learn the truth that

09:14.704 --> 09:16.760
parents aren’t heroes.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.040
They’re humans just like us.

09:20.990 --> 09:22.176
With a dark side

09:22.200 --> 09:23.240
and a bright side.

09:25.020 --> 09:26.368
Would you be able to accept it?

09:27.070 --> 09:29.208
If they, too, had done something wrong.

09:31.210 --> 09:33.210
If Chatfah is still gone like this,

09:34.180 --> 09:36.792
I think we have to divide up the wealth again.

09:37.520 --> 09:38.760
When that time comes,

09:40.150 --> 09:42.864
you should stop running to your Mom and Dad, crying.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.296
The body that they found,

10:03.320 --> 10:05.952
it might not be the only secret in our family.

10:06.820 --> 10:08.408
The well is discovered.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
Do you think…

10:10.370 --> 10:12.768
that you won’t be dragged into it?

10:35.240 --> 10:38.544
PRESENT

10:54.848 --> 10:56.540
Are you saying that

10:56.990 --> 10:59.248
the body is the person you saw drowning

10:59.280 --> 11:00.430
when you were young?

11:02.208 --> 11:04.210
I can’t confirm it.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.040
It’s more like a dream.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.760
But at the scene of that incident,

11:11.230 --> 11:12.776
there were my Dad,

11:12.800 --> 11:14.096
Chatfah,

11:14.750 --> 11:16.144
and Uncle Kajorn.

11:17.380 --> 11:19.056
But I don’t know

11:19.090 --> 11:21.600
whether Uncle Kajorn would tell me the truth

11:21.640 --> 11:23.370
if I were to ask him.

11:25.820 --> 11:29.056
We'd do our best in investigating, no matter what.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.024
But thank you so much anyways

11:32.048 --> 11:33.520
for providing more information.

11:39.970 --> 11:41.224
But from now on,

11:41.970 --> 11:44.128
I won’t come and meet you like this anymore.

11:49.380 --> 11:51.080
If you have any more information

11:51.712 --> 11:53.792
then I’d appreciate it if you follow the procedures.

12:06.536 --> 12:07.768
I’m sorry

12:08.530 --> 12:10.304
if I put you in a hard place.

12:12.328 --> 12:14.330
But the reason why I wanted to talk to you

12:14.750 --> 12:17.088
is because you’re the only one I trust.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.472
I’m confused by so many things right now.

12:24.950 --> 12:27.232
Even the person I used to trust the most

12:28.288 --> 12:30.290
can’t seem to be trusted anymore.

12:31.780 --> 12:33.904
As soon as this came to mind,

12:33.920 --> 12:36.312
the first person I wanted to talk to was you.

12:42.740 --> 12:44.368
I didn’t think it through.

12:45.350 --> 12:48.424
We're no longer just some old friends anymore.

12:53.180 --> 12:54.384
I’m sorry.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.456
From now on, I won’t bother you anymore.

13:02.760 --> 13:05.968
Anyways, thank you for coming to see me today.

13:27.250 --> 13:31.136
2006

13:31.856 --> 13:33.000
Miss Picha!

13:33.032 --> 13:34.232
Miss Picha!

13:34.520 --> 13:35.816
Mr. Asok!

13:35.848 --> 13:37.008
Mr. Asok!

13:37.040 --> 13:38.248
Miss Picha is having a seizure again!

13:38.272 --> 13:39.272
Picha!

13:39.300 --> 13:40.144
Miss Picha!

13:40.168 --> 13:41.168
Picha!

13:42.470 --> 13:43.630
What’s wrong with you, Picha?

13:45.380 --> 13:46.380
Picha.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.720
Please move aside.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.568
Open your mouth.

13:51.200 --> 13:52.368
What are you doing?

13:52.980 --> 13:55.592
She might bite her tongue.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.304
What are you doing?!

13:57.740 --> 13:58.880
Stop that right now.

13:59.128 --> 14:00.128
Get off her!

14:01.060 --> 14:02.160
Picha, my baby.

14:02.192 --> 14:03.192
Picha!

14:03.360 --> 14:04.360
Picha!

14:05.330 --> 14:06.896
Easy there, baby.

14:06.928 --> 14:07.936
Picha.

14:08.400 --> 14:09.400
Picha.

14:11.304 --> 14:12.672
What were you doing?

14:15.580 --> 14:17.392
Are you going to let her kill our child?

14:18.536 --> 14:19.536
Picha…

14:20.240 --> 14:21.240
Picha…

14:25.168 --> 14:27.170
When our child has that symptom,

14:28.060 --> 14:29.488
I don’t know what to do.

14:32.870 --> 14:34.496
I’ve already spoken to the doctor.

14:34.810 --> 14:36.920
They said we should just monitor her.

14:37.450 --> 14:38.968
A seizure like this should be gone

14:39.008 --> 14:40.600
within 2-3 minutes.

14:41.020 --> 14:43.360
I also noticed that she’s getting better and better.

14:44.100 --> 14:46.544
Then why were you gone for so long this time?

14:47.530 --> 14:49.344
I am back, though.

14:49.376 --> 14:52.184
This time, I will take care of the children

14:52.208 --> 14:53.952
and of you too.

15:03.060 --> 15:05.904
I don’t want to be sick like this.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.900
I made Dad stressed.

15:08.740 --> 15:09.920
Oh dear.

15:09.952 --> 15:13.104
Dad has always been stressed out.

15:13.120 --> 15:13.656
Hmm?

15:13.696 --> 15:16.608
It’s good that he’s stressed about his child sometimes,

15:16.632 --> 15:18.512
so he wouldn’t just be stressed out about work.

15:18.536 --> 15:19.536
Sounds good?

15:19.580 --> 15:21.856
I’ve brought you lots of snacks.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.120
Let me get them for you.

15:25.040 --> 15:28.208
The kids in America love these.

15:30.210 --> 15:31.352
But…

15:31.670 --> 15:34.744
Dad doesn’t allow such sweets.

15:35.160 --> 15:36.728
It’s alright.

15:36.768 --> 15:40.288
Just keep it a secret between us.

15:40.312 --> 15:41.520
Alright?

15:42.540 --> 15:44.896
Mom!

15:44.920 --> 15:46.232
Mom!

15:50.488 --> 15:52.328
I’ve missed you guys.

15:52.424 --> 15:53.936
Did you guys miss me?

15:53.976 --> 15:55.784
Yes!

15:55.808 --> 15:56.864
Did you guys fight?

15:58.260 --> 15:59.624
Are you sure?

16:19.980 --> 16:23.448
(Hello! You’re watching Hashtag Tag Tag!)

16:23.480 --> 16:25.816
(It's still an ongoing gossip, )

16:25.856 --> 16:28.080
(for the disappearance of Chatfah, )

16:28.112 --> 16:29.320
(an heiress to a famous family.)

16:29.344 --> 16:32.464
(There’s no progress on the investigation just yet)

16:32.490 --> 16:34.928
(but there are lots of things that seem shady.)

16:34.968 --> 16:35.664
(The internet is curious)

16:35.688 --> 16:36.904
(as to who's really behind this.)

16:36.928 --> 16:39.008
(Is it the fiancé or the 3 older sisters?)

16:39.040 --> 16:41.520
(But the one that’s got the highest vote from the internet)

16:41.552 --> 16:43.608
(is probably the third sister.)

16:43.632 --> 16:46.016
(Since she has just been awarded a prize)

16:46.048 --> 16:47.568
(in an international jewelry award.)

16:47.616 --> 16:50.800
(This piece would also get to be manufactured in Dubai.)

16:50.856 --> 16:53.592
(The thing is, the sketch of this jewelry set)

16:53.616 --> 16:55.736
(happens to be similar to the sketch for)

16:55.768 --> 16:56.688
(next season’s jewelry collection)

16:56.712 --> 16:59.920
(by God Gem, a brand that Chatfah, her sister, )

16:59.944 --> 17:01.166
(is holding the brand ambassador title.)

17:01.190 --> 17:02.920
(It’s so similar that it seems like)

17:02.952 --> 17:04.036
(the same sketch has been submitted.)

17:04.060 --> 17:06.440
(Rumor has it that the prize the third sister’s company)

17:06.472 --> 17:08.712
(is going to get from the competition)

17:08.728 --> 17:10.272
(is over tens of millions!)

17:10.296 --> 17:11.784
(So the internet is suspicious that, )

17:11.808 --> 17:14.144
(just maybe, this could be the motive.)

18:15.088 --> 18:16.140
What are you doing?

18:19.440 --> 18:20.872
What are these pictures?

18:23.810 --> 18:24.944
Nothing.

18:27.860 --> 18:29.480
I thought

18:30.290 --> 18:32.088
you liked Chatfah all along.

18:33.760 --> 18:34.760
I used to.

18:38.460 --> 18:39.776
But people

18:40.810 --> 18:42.656
can always have a change of heart, right?

18:45.690 --> 18:47.144
It also doesn’t mean that

18:47.864 --> 18:49.860
you can hold this against me.

18:51.860 --> 18:53.464
I’m not lenient like Nathat.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.352
Don’t forget

18:57.140 --> 18:58.248
that I’m

19:00.060 --> 19:01.568
holding your secret.

19:09.872 --> 19:11.312
And about that scissor,

19:12.350 --> 19:13.864
I think you should stop searching.

19:14.810 --> 19:16.080
You won’t find it.

19:32.080 --> 19:33.280
Yes?

19:33.312 --> 19:34.392
(Chompoo!)

19:34.432 --> 19:36.504
(It’s good that you’re already up.)

19:36.530 --> 19:37.168
(Can you quickly do a live streaming)

19:37.216 --> 19:39.056
(to sell some clothes instead of Sarah?)

19:39.096 --> 19:41.960
(I couldn’t contact her since this morning.)

19:45.410 --> 19:46.728
Did you find him, Aunty Chom?

19:46.761 --> 19:48.073
No.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.488
But Dad never disappeared

19:49.512 --> 19:50.920
without telling anyone.

19:50.960 --> 19:53.032
Maybe he went out for a run.

19:53.064 --> 19:55.168
These days, Mr. Kajorn is into running at night

19:55.200 --> 19:56.928
or at dawn.

19:57.152 --> 19:59.088
He says it’s not hot.

20:00.368 --> 20:02.370
But shouldn’t he be back by now?

20:02.784 --> 20:04.672
Well, if you’re worried

20:04.712 --> 20:07.040
then I’ll help you look for him.

20:12.310 --> 20:14.184
Dad likes to run in this area.

20:14.224 --> 20:15.384
I’m afraid that he might pass out

20:15.408 --> 20:16.728
and collapsed while he was alone.

20:16.980 --> 20:18.048
Then…

20:18.500 --> 20:20.608
I’ll have a look around for you.

20:59.424 --> 21:02.064
Miss Pi, the press keeps calling.

21:03.140 --> 21:04.160
I know.

21:04.990 --> 21:07.752
The judges want to hear about our response.

21:07.776 --> 21:10.840
They said it’s being reviewed.

21:10.880 --> 21:14.088
The judges don’t want to be targeted either.

21:14.112 --> 21:16.264
We really didn’t copy them, right?

21:16.544 --> 21:19.072
Do you have any connections with the judges?

21:19.544 --> 21:21.540
I want to have a talk with them.

21:21.920 --> 21:25.528
Alright, I’ll try to get connected from our side.

21:26.750 --> 21:27.776
This…

21:28.310 --> 21:29.936
Someone sent it to you.

21:34.784 --> 21:36.744
TO MISS PUDPICHAYA BUPPHACHINDA
PICHAGEM CO., LTD.

21:47.420 --> 21:50.376
NOW YOU REALLY GET TO BE THE VICTIM.

22:08.040 --> 22:09.040
Hello?

22:12.100 --> 22:13.200
Uncle Kajorn!

22:14.340 --> 22:15.176
So cute!

22:15.208 --> 22:16.560
This one's a must-have too.

22:16.808 --> 22:17.656
Someone just placed an order,

22:17.688 --> 22:18.712
let me just check.

22:20.220 --> 22:23.656
(Chom, I’m sorry about what happened to Uncle Kajorn.)

22:23.696 --> 22:27.984
(What’s up with this household?
(The real bloody legacy.)

22:34.290 --> 22:35.290
Parn!

22:35.420 --> 22:36.688
What happened?

22:42.120 --> 22:43.120
Dad!

22:43.380 --> 22:44.032
Dad!

22:44.048 --> 22:44.960
- Dad!
- Hey! Parn!

22:44.980 --> 22:46.328
Parn!

22:48.490 --> 22:50.096
Dad!

22:53.848 --> 22:54.848
Uncle Kajorn…

22:55.340 --> 22:57.560
Parn, what happened?

22:58.660 --> 23:00.344
You guys are the ones to tell me.

23:00.910 --> 23:01.910
Parn,

23:02.340 --> 23:03.592
we don’t know about this.

23:06.870 --> 23:09.248
If this really is a game for the legacy

23:10.290 --> 23:12.272
then what did I do wrong?

23:12.680 --> 23:13.944
What did I do wrong

23:13.980 --> 23:16.736
that I have to be dragged into this?

23:16.776 --> 23:18.168
Calm down, Parn.

23:18.920 --> 23:19.920
Parn,

23:20.270 --> 23:21.824
no one sees it that way.

23:21.864 --> 23:23.416
Are you sure?

23:24.470 --> 23:27.944
Then answer me, where has Bua gone?

23:41.390 --> 23:42.632
I can’t reach her by phone.

23:43.390 --> 23:44.880
The car is parked in the same place.

23:47.820 --> 23:48.820
Could it be

23:48.848 --> 23:50.072
that Bua was kidnapped

23:50.096 --> 23:51.728
by the attacker who killed Uncle Kajorn?

23:53.930 --> 23:54.736
No matter which way you think of it,

23:54.768 --> 23:56.110
none sounds good.

23:57.620 --> 23:59.128
I don’t understand, Pi.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.080
What’s really happening to our family?

24:05.450 --> 24:07.184
But someone like Bua

24:07.208 --> 24:09.368
would never disappear all of a sudden.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.000
The only thing I can think of now

24:13.048 --> 24:15.192
is that she got kidnapped by an attacker.

24:20.180 --> 24:21.496
Don’t forget, Pi,

24:22.000 --> 24:23.424
that girl can also do anything

24:23.456 --> 24:25.152
for her own benefit.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.184
Chom.

24:27.216 --> 24:28.552
Did I say anything wrong?

24:30.100 --> 24:31.672
Look at what she did to me

24:31.680 --> 24:32.680
and to everyone.

24:34.464 --> 24:36.460
Then what are you trying to say?

24:36.648 --> 24:37.768
Are you saying that

24:37.800 --> 24:39.448
Bua is the one who killed Kajorn

24:39.472 --> 24:40.944
and ran away?

24:41.730 --> 24:43.944
That’s not who Bua is.

24:44.568 --> 24:46.570
Then what’s everyone really like?

24:47.880 --> 24:49.912
After everything that has happened,

24:50.580 --> 24:54.664
I don’t know who we really are anymore.

24:55.430 --> 24:56.776
What are our personalities?

24:56.816 --> 24:57.872
I don’t even know

24:58.152 --> 24:59.928
even when we grew up together,

25:00.312 --> 25:01.520
with the same parents,

25:01.560 --> 25:02.864
were brought up the same way,

25:02.896 --> 25:04.440
and taught to love each other.

25:06.240 --> 25:08.240
Look at our ‘love’.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.960
If we really love each other,

25:11.620 --> 25:13.408
would our family be a wreck like this?

25:16.260 --> 25:17.288
Chom.

25:17.870 --> 25:19.712
You’re lashing out.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.280
I understand.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.776
I’m not lashing out

25:24.550 --> 25:26.368
but I’ve just come to my senses.

25:28.370 --> 25:29.544
In our family,

25:29.576 --> 25:31.056
we weren’t taught to love each other.

25:32.570 --> 25:34.064
We were taught to love ourselves.

25:36.920 --> 25:38.096
Love ourselves in the way that

25:38.120 --> 25:39.512
you put yourself first.

25:41.150 --> 25:42.176
That’s not true.

25:43.060 --> 25:44.720
That’s not what Mom said.

25:45.736 --> 25:46.736
Are you sure?

25:50.930 --> 25:52.568
If you want anything,

25:54.296 --> 25:56.300
you should try harder.

25:58.050 --> 25:59.944
Because if you haven’t got it,

26:01.560 --> 26:03.920
then that means you didn’t try hard enough.

26:07.020 --> 26:09.256
This world has no place for failure.

26:11.460 --> 26:13.600
Even when it comes to your own desire.

26:22.590 --> 26:25.944
2016

26:34.952 --> 26:36.950
Here you are!

26:37.560 --> 26:39.120
I’ve been looking for you.

26:40.930 --> 26:42.568
It’s nice and cool here.

26:43.780 --> 26:45.040
Where’s Chat?

26:45.580 --> 26:46.616
I don’t know.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.000
Our bodies are not stuck together.

27:03.440 --> 27:06.488
For Chompoo, from Nop.

27:08.060 --> 27:09.060
Nop?

27:10.230 --> 27:12.792
The school team footballer, Nop?

27:13.160 --> 27:14.440
Is he hitting on you?

27:15.460 --> 27:16.544
I don’t know.

27:16.768 --> 27:17.976
We’ve never talked.

27:18.940 --> 27:21.104
But opening other people's bags like this

27:21.128 --> 27:22.320
is so damn rude.

27:22.970 --> 27:23.970
Trash that.

27:26.900 --> 27:29.360
You’re pretty popular, huh?

27:30.980 --> 27:31.984
Of course.

27:37.980 --> 27:38.980
What are you drawing?

27:39.512 --> 27:40.208
Is it nice?

27:40.240 --> 27:41.272
The Buppachat Mansion.

27:43.640 --> 27:45.160
You’re Chompoonuch, right?

27:47.304 --> 27:49.032
Yeah, why?

27:50.580 --> 27:51.580
Ouch!

27:56.290 --> 27:57.976
If your reason is not good enough,

27:58.530 --> 27:59.680
you’re done for.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.120
Why are you flirting with my friend’s boyfriend?

28:02.370 --> 28:03.456
Flirting what?

28:08.832 --> 28:11.876
(- You look so cool when you play football.)
(-Then come and watch me play.)
(-I don’t dare go. Your girlfriend would be angry.)
(-I don’t have a girlfriend.)

28:11.900 --> 28:13.168
You know damn well

28:13.216 --> 28:14.936
that I’m Nop’s girlfriend.

28:14.968 --> 28:16.940
So why did you DM my boyfriend?

28:16.952 --> 28:17.952
Huh?

28:20.750 --> 28:21.750
A girlfriend?

28:22.120 --> 28:23.576
Did you know she’s his girlfriend?

28:24.780 --> 28:26.952
Even he himself said that you’re not.

28:26.976 --> 28:28.160
You’re delusional.

28:30.872 --> 28:31.872
You!

28:35.550 --> 28:36.784
One more thing,

28:36.800 --> 28:39.176
the account you saw was a fake one.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.160
That’s not my account.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.968
I’ve never flirted with your boyfriend.

28:42.016 --> 28:43.016
It’s yours!

28:43.312 --> 28:44.496
This bitch!

28:44.536 --> 28:45.992
Why are you picking on me?

28:46.520 --> 28:47.584
I told you

28:47.608 --> 28:48.728
that it wasn’t my account.

28:48.768 --> 28:50.216
I’ve never flirted with your boyfriend.

28:50.240 --> 28:51.400
If you're sick, then go see a doctor,

28:51.424 --> 28:53.480
don’t just come and pick on me.

28:53.980 --> 28:54.980
Why?

28:56.500 --> 28:57.500
Come here!

28:57.970 --> 28:59.128
Chom.

28:59.160 --> 29:00.136
Chom.

29:00.184 --> 29:01.256
That’s enough.

29:01.288 --> 29:02.696
Chom, that’s enough.

29:03.420 --> 29:04.420
This bitch!

29:04.912 --> 29:05.912
You crazy bitch!

29:06.152 --> 29:07.408
Stop it!

29:07.456 --> 29:08.816
What are you guys doing?

29:08.848 --> 29:10.216
What are you guys doing?

29:14.688 --> 29:16.696
STUDENT WELFARE DEPARTMENT

29:18.130 --> 29:19.680
I’m so bummed out, Mom.

29:20.112 --> 29:22.110
Why did I get my points deducted?

29:22.136 --> 29:24.288
I wasn’t the one who started it.

29:25.260 --> 29:27.576
She started it, and I even got hurt.

29:27.608 --> 29:28.368
Look.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.720
Instead of realizing what she did wrong…

29:31.590 --> 29:32.776
Remember, as a girl,

29:32.792 --> 29:36.344
don’t just put on makeup or dress prettily.

29:36.380 --> 29:38.888
You have to behave nicely too.

29:38.928 --> 29:41.288
Otherwise, a rowdy personality would show.

29:41.328 --> 29:43.776
People could tell how one was brought up.

29:53.180 --> 29:54.180
That’s true.

29:55.220 --> 29:57.460
Some people put on makeup to make themselves look pretty

29:58.000 --> 29:59.592
and carry themselves nicely

30:01.820 --> 30:03.352
but still don't look beautiful.

30:04.230 --> 30:06.488
If being beautiful is easy

30:07.100 --> 30:08.584
then why aren’t you beautiful?

30:26.580 --> 30:28.264
That was so funny!

30:28.856 --> 30:30.860
You should have seen the face of that Mom.

30:30.896 --> 30:31.720
She was dumbfounded.

30:31.752 --> 30:32.512
For real.

30:32.528 --> 30:33.128
Wow…

30:33.152 --> 30:34.384
What a shame.

30:34.408 --> 30:35.976
I want to be at the scene too.

30:36.640 --> 30:39.624
This kind of girl should be put in her place.

30:39.640 --> 30:41.620
Her Mum probably didn’t educate her.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.920
Woah.

30:44.310 --> 30:45.536
So scary.

30:45.568 --> 30:48.952
But never tell Dad about this.

30:48.976 --> 30:52.000
He’s even scarier than the student welfare teacher.

30:52.032 --> 30:53.784
Definitely not telling.

30:57.430 --> 31:00.752
Chom, you have to be more patient.

31:01.640 --> 31:03.224
Alright, Mom.

31:05.350 --> 31:07.888
If you want to be a news anchor,

31:07.928 --> 31:10.032
you have to look pretty

31:10.072 --> 31:11.456
and carry yourself gracefully.

31:11.832 --> 31:13.830
She’s not worth losing yourself for.

31:14.780 --> 31:16.624
Roger that, Mom.

31:17.230 --> 31:18.960
But I’m still annoyed.

31:18.992 --> 31:21.936
I wonder who made the account to impersonate me.

31:25.940 --> 31:26.940
Mom,

31:27.440 --> 31:29.328
it’s time for my piano lesson.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.776
Then I’ll give you a lift.

31:31.220 --> 31:32.220
Okay.

31:54.470 --> 31:56.056
Don’t touch my stuff!

32:03.392 --> 32:04.392
What’s up with her?

32:04.950 --> 32:05.960
No idea.

32:06.660 --> 32:07.712
Why is she so pissed?

32:11.530 --> 32:12.768
Oh, there’s Chom.

32:16.770 --> 32:17.888
Where did she go?

32:24.300 --> 32:25.328
What are you doing?

32:32.380 --> 32:34.032
That’s crazy.

32:34.340 --> 32:36.128
What has Chom done to them?

32:36.168 --> 32:38.000
Why did they have to go this far?

32:40.090 --> 32:41.944
Uh.. do you really not know?

32:43.090 --> 32:45.568
Your sister is hated by so many people.

32:46.140 --> 32:48.400
She even has anti-fans on the internet.

32:48.440 --> 32:50.400
What has my sister done to them?

32:50.440 --> 32:52.400
They said your sister

32:53.120 --> 32:54.480
likes to send DMs to guys

32:54.504 --> 32:55.864
who are already taken.

32:57.020 --> 32:58.768
It happened to a lot of people.

32:59.024 --> 33:01.280
But your sister, Chatfah,

33:01.352 --> 33:03.504
has talked it out for so many cases.

33:03.960 --> 33:05.584
That’s why your sister got away with it.

33:14.210 --> 33:15.152
I think you’re definitely getting to become

33:15.168 --> 33:17.152
the school’s drum major this year.

33:17.850 --> 33:20.480
Oh, I’m not sure about that.

33:20.512 --> 33:22.480
That’s always been Chom’s role.

33:22.520 --> 33:24.608
Maybe she’ll get to do it this year too.

33:24.928 --> 33:25.784
Actually,

33:25.816 --> 33:28.432
Chom used to be Miss Popular Votes every year too.

33:28.448 --> 33:30.320
But you managed to replace her.

33:30.568 --> 33:32.040
But how can you not get it?

33:32.072 --> 33:34.496
Chom was texting every senior boy who was taken.

33:34.520 --> 33:35.960
The whole school hates her now.

33:37.610 --> 33:38.496
Let me see the pictures.

33:38.536 --> 33:39.536
Sure.

33:40.864 --> 33:41.640
Pretty, right?

33:41.664 --> 33:42.664
So pretty!

33:42.696 --> 33:43.432
So pretty.

33:43.456 --> 33:44.864
Well deserved.

33:46.180 --> 33:47.632
- Sooo pretty.
- Love it.

33:47.656 --> 33:48.656
Right?

33:53.040 --> 33:56.056
I shouldn’t have let Chat do that to Chom.

33:57.210 --> 33:58.744
It’s my fault

33:58.760 --> 34:00.608
that I didn’t stop her.

34:01.670 --> 34:04.224
I know that you’re not worried about

34:04.248 --> 34:05.768
those votes and all.

34:07.240 --> 34:09.536
But I don’t want Chom to be hated

34:09.780 --> 34:11.960
when she hasn’t done anything.

34:20.920 --> 34:22.016
Don’t cry.

34:22.040 --> 34:22.992
Calm down.

34:23.024 --> 34:24.688
I’ll take care of it.

34:26.180 --> 34:26.912
Yes?

34:27.112 --> 34:29.040
And stop blaming yourself.

34:34.570 --> 34:35.952
It’s alright.

34:37.010 --> 34:41.080
I know you tried your best to help me.

34:58.150 --> 35:01.936
You know why I called you over, right?

35:06.390 --> 35:07.424
I do.

35:09.580 --> 35:11.224
Why did you do that?

35:21.440 --> 35:23.440
I want to be a drum major.

35:26.280 --> 35:28.752
I have a dream to become one like Chom.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.160
I want to become a star.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.824
I want to become famous.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.820
I want to have a good profile.

35:35.824 --> 35:38.536
I see that Chom got the opportunities

35:39.816 --> 35:41.728
because Chom is pretty,

35:41.760 --> 35:43.168
and Chom is smart.

35:44.300 --> 35:45.576
Chom gets to be the school’s star

35:45.600 --> 35:46.736
since she was in middle school.

35:46.760 --> 35:47.960
She got to be the drum major

35:48.000 --> 35:49.176
since she was my age.

35:49.944 --> 35:51.940
And she has always been one.

35:52.808 --> 35:54.810
But I can’t be like Chom

35:54.832 --> 35:56.384
if she’s still holding that position.

35:56.408 --> 35:57.800
But you shouldn’t get it

35:57.832 --> 35:59.592
with such a dirty trick, right?

36:01.990 --> 36:02.990
Chat,

36:03.780 --> 36:06.536
Chom got it with her own abilities.

36:07.490 --> 36:10.096
You should get it with your own ability too.

36:13.320 --> 36:14.720
Your sisters are right.

36:16.030 --> 36:19.584
When you want something,

36:19.608 --> 36:21.800
you should get it with your own abilities.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.544
Also,

36:28.256 --> 36:30.260
you can’t do that

36:30.608 --> 36:32.610
because she’s your sister.

36:33.672 --> 36:35.670
She’s a family member.

36:36.620 --> 36:39.008
We have to love each other since we’re a family.

36:39.896 --> 36:42.032
When people look in on us,

36:42.064 --> 36:44.064
how would they perceive our family?

36:44.088 --> 36:45.408
Have you ever thought about that?

37:03.864 --> 37:05.860
But I would like to praise you.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.592
I would like to praise you

37:09.608 --> 37:11.590
for your effort.

37:12.720 --> 37:14.960
Because there are probably not many people

37:15.710 --> 37:16.752
who would try this hard

37:16.776 --> 37:19.128
to get what they want.

37:25.160 --> 37:26.752
If you want something,

37:28.350 --> 37:30.008
you have to put effort into it

37:31.096 --> 37:33.024
and make it yours.

37:39.230 --> 37:40.230
Therefore,

37:43.050 --> 37:44.600
if Chompoo fails,

37:46.310 --> 37:49.040
this will be a lesson for you that

37:51.400 --> 37:53.600
you haven’t tried hard enough.

38:04.800 --> 38:06.536
Because this world

38:11.710 --> 38:14.200
has no place for you to fail.

38:16.456 --> 38:18.784
Even when it comes to your own desires.

38:24.432 --> 38:25.552
Do you understand?

38:26.272 --> 38:28.270
We really were taught that way.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.304
Even if we have to kill each other,

38:33.570 --> 38:35.736
if that gets us what we want

38:37.340 --> 38:38.664
then that’s the right thing.

38:45.320 --> 38:47.048
So is it still there?

38:48.920 --> 38:51.064
The sincerity among our family?

38:59.840 --> 39:01.160
It’s not there anymore.

39:04.780 --> 39:06.408
The only thing left now is

39:07.970 --> 39:10.112
of all the things that have happened,

39:11.520 --> 39:13.104
who was the one behind it?

39:32.820 --> 39:34.456
YOU ARE NEXT.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.144
Who sent this?

39:38.020 --> 39:39.020
I don’t know.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.208
But for a moment, I thought

39:47.450 --> 39:49.136
there’s only one person

39:50.020 --> 39:51.140
who uses such a dirty trick.

39:52.920 --> 39:53.992
Chatfah.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.552
Why would Chat do that?

39:58.340 --> 39:59.128
I don’t understand.

39:59.152 --> 40:00.000
So,

40:00.032 --> 40:03.896
Chat made up a story that she’s gone

40:04.780 --> 40:06.424
to come back and stab us in the back

40:06.440 --> 40:07.848
one by one like this?

40:09.270 --> 40:11.288
She might be the only one

40:11.320 --> 40:13.424
who’s trying to find out that truth.

40:14.700 --> 40:16.128
What truth?

40:17.900 --> 40:19.184
Can’t you remember?

40:20.380 --> 40:23.312
That night, when she fell down and disappeared,

40:23.840 --> 40:25.624
what was she talking about then?

40:27.110 --> 40:28.496
She was talking about

40:29.350 --> 40:31.032
who killed mom.

40:32.368 --> 40:34.370
(There’s no enemy more frightening)

40:34.400 --> 40:37.560
(than an enemy who knows you best.)

40:38.160 --> 40:41.840
But we both already know the truth

40:41.872 --> 40:43.176
about who killed Mom.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.584
Yes, we knew.

40:47.260 --> 40:49.160
But is what we know

40:49.200 --> 40:50.872
really the truth?

40:53.296 --> 40:54.870
What do you mean?

40:56.176 --> 40:58.180
Is the Mom we love so much

40:59.780 --> 41:02.384
the Mom we really know?

41:03.560 --> 41:07.160
(So hide your true colors.)

41:07.590 --> 41:10.344
(Don’t let anyone cross the wall into your heart.)

41:15.660 --> 41:18.624
(Sometimes, even family)

41:18.648 --> 41:20.620
(might not be a safe zone.)

41:37.090 --> 41:39.264
(If you still want to live, )

41:39.970 --> 41:42.488
(the only one you should protect)

41:43.500 --> 41:44.656
(is yourself.)

42:10.544 --> 42:12.728
Why would you pretend to care about me?

42:12.752 --> 42:13.648
I didn’t pretend.

42:13.696 --> 42:15.320
That night, when the fire broke out,

42:15.352 --> 42:17.072
Sarah probably didn’t escape in time.

42:17.088 --> 42:18.576
I can testify for you.

42:18.616 --> 42:20.912
That you were with me all night.

42:20.928 --> 42:22.910
There's CCTV in front of the place.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.152
MISSING

42:24.184 --> 42:25.784
Have you seen these two in the pictures?
