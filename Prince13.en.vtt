What is happening?

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.800
Send someone out
to find Khanin immediately.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.720
Soldiers,

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.360
detain Prince Wasin.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:35.360
Your Royal Highness!

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.720
Go to hell.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.120
- Your Royal Highness!
- Watch out!

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.720
Chakri...

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.400
Chakri!

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.200
- Chakri!
- Chakri!

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.830
Your Majesty, will you really
let Khanin and me leave

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.680
without ever seeing Tharin?

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.260
Please let me stay
for a few more days...

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.500
That's not possible.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.060
Things are far too unstable
as they stand.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.640
Tharin agrees with me.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.880
He's sent his regrets
that he cannot see you and Khanin off.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.580
Has Khanin recovered
from yesterday's shock?

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.530
He is alright now, Your Majesty.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.370
How about you?

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.660
Even with royal guards stationed
at all times, they dared to break in.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.940
Trust me. There's truly no time.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.440
You must leave now.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.240
I understand, but...

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.320
Just go, and stay safe.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.700
When peace returns,

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.650
I'll come for you and Khanin.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.950
Yes.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:00.810
I'd like to take my leave.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.970
Chita, you stay.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.880
I have faith in you.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.400
Ensure the safety
of Princess Khunita and Prince Khanin.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.260
I'll dispatch
my finest soldiers to help.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.920
As for Charan,

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.370
he will be under my protection

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.040
until you return from the UK.

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.190
I'm afraid...

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.930
it may not be proper, Your Majesty.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.440
Your family, Phithakthewa,
has always been loyal.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.660
I shall adopt Charan.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.010
I see no reason this would be improper.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.940
It is decided.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:11.790
I am most grateful, Your Majesty.

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.240
Moving on to the news
that has shaken the entire nation.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.920
It's the Royal Competition's
archery match,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.440
taking place in Meenanagarin.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.580
[Their Royal Highnesses Ambushed
during Archery Match in Meenanagarin]

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.260
As you can see,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.870
an explosion occurred
in the middle of the Competition.

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:54.030
Reports also confirm that outsiders

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.040
infiltrated the arena in an attempt
to assassinate Their Royal Highnesses.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:09.960
Oh, Khanin...

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:23.960
Are you injured, dear?

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.060
Just a minor injury, Father.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.890
But it has been taken care of.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.260
I'm alright, Father.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.720
Well...

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:38.300
how is Grandfather doing?

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.560
The doctors have taken the bullet out.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.159
However...

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.370
Your Royal Highnesses...

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.340
The condition of His Majesty
has now passed the critical stage.

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:23.470
Ran,

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.750
thank you for always protecting me
and the Assavadevathins.

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:37.330
Why are you protecting him?

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.880
Don't you know he's the one
who caused your mother's death?

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.700
About what Prince Wasin said,

00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:51.950
can you tell me about that?

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:54.900
Did he mean...

00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:00.520
Grandfather caused your mother...

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:02.990
Nin...

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.860
Listen to me.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.140
I've known the truth all along.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:16.210
What happened in the past
has nothing to do with you.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.140
I'm not sure...

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.090
if you should know about it.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:32.510
Why, though?

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.960
I don't want it to weigh on you.

00:08:39.169 --> 00:08:41.950
But I already know it from Prince Wasin.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.860
Please let me know the whole truth.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.400
First of all,

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.120
the one who caused...

00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.530
your mother's death...

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:03.260
Was it Grandfather?

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.720
Actually,

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:14.920
I thought it was him, too.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:18.640
But it wasn't.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.070
Chita,

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.160
I'm sorry.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.370
Why would you be, Your Royal Highness?

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.530
You had to leave your family
just to be here for us.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.450
I consider it
a great honor to serve you.

00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.680
Mother!

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.290
Mother! Where are you going?

00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:13.330
Mother!

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.670
Mother...

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.170
Charan is still just a child.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:24.990
When he grows up,

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:27.940
he will understand me,
Your Royal Highness.

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.440
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:09.920
For them to catch up
despite our hasty escape...

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.840
There must be a traitor among us.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.980
As you are aware, it was Prince Wasin

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.840
who was behind the assassination attempt
on both Princess Khunita and you.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:49.290
The one who saw the incident that night
was Mr. Thatdanai.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.440
Your Royal Highness...

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.270
Your Royal Highness!

00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:55.290
Chita...

00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:56.750
Chita!

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.400
Chita!

00:11:59.020 --> 00:11:59.920
Chase after them.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.560
Now!

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.170
Your Royal Highness!

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.400
When he came to our house,

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.350
I probably sneaked into his car.

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:47.460
That day might be the reason why...

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:54.660
Mother!

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.020
- Don't get in there!
- Mother!

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:07.300
I've come to hate the rain.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.760
Then,

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:28.610
what Prince Wasin said
wasn't wrong after all

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.640
- because the Assavadevathins...
- That's not it.

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.120
The duties of the Phithakthewas
to the Assavadevathins

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.960
are to protect, take care of,

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.680
and remain loyal.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.770
It's not due to any command,

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.160
but because of a vow.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.140
Are you not mad at me at all?

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.540
Your mother died,

00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.640
but I lived.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:05.420
Do I really seem so unreasonable?

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.720
If I were you,

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:11.290
I have no idea if I would...

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.370
I'm not mad at you

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.040
or anyone.

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:28.640
No one...

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:31.940
wished for any of that to happen.

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.300
Prince Wasin himself
has also passed away.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.200
But...

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.360
how could I face you?

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:50.000
I feel like it was my fault
that your mother...

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.720
You were just a baby, Nin.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:55.370
How would it be your fault?

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.400
But...

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:05.730
I should be grateful

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.140
that you came back to Emmaly with me.

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.760
Had I not found you,

00:15:15.570 --> 00:15:17.540

in Emmaly's internal affairs.

As acting regent for His Majesty,

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:54.740
I hereby declare that
Prince Wasin has passed away.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:58.030
Please rise and join me
in a moment of silence in his honor.

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.160
You may sit down.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.040
As there is no heir
to the throne of Meenanagarin,

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:23.640
its authority must now return
to the central rule.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:27.500
I shall assume temporary governorship
over it for the time being.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.720
And what will happen

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:30.760
to the Royal Competition?

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:33.800
Rachata,

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.440
now is not the best time
to speak of this.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:39.960
It's alright.

00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:44.640
As you are well aware,

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:48.140
there was corruption
in the first round of the Competition.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.680
The archery results
have also been invalidated.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:02.920
Moreover, we are also unable
to hold another archery match.

00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:05.200
Thus, I wish to discuss this
with you first.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.480
Are you saying
the Competition will no longer continue?

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:17.840
I would like to see
His Majesty recover first.

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.640
When that time comes,

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:23.440
we shall reconsider
the Royal Competition.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.420
I'm going to be honest here.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.960
Even if something happened to the King,

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.920
wouldn't the Competition
still have to go on?

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:39.480
Rachata,

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:41.520
how could you say such a thing?

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.670
You are right, Rachata.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.960
However, after assessing the situation,

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:58.940
I still cannot assure the safety
of every royal family member.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:03.570
If anything happens,
wouldn't it make things even worse?

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.760
Goddammit!

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.940
Those damn Assavadevathins!

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.680
They don't want me to take the throne.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.150
That's why
they invalidated the Competition

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.370
when you were just about to win!

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:31.940
What is wrong with you?

00:21:32.690 --> 00:21:33.890
Nothing to say?

00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.480
I'm upset, too, Father.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.520
Is this how you show anger?

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.440
What a coward you are.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.080
You're completely useless!

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.720
Please stop, Your Royal Highness.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:54.200
Go away.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.240
Go away!

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.360
Please let me bear
the punishment instead.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.480
What are you talking about?

00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.400
What?

00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:09.460
Who do you think you are?

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:10.800
Speak.

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.440
Please forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

00:22:16.210 --> 00:22:18.130
I had no right.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.640
You had no right?

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.480
You have no right to stand in my way!

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:34.960
Stay down.

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:37.940
Now,

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.940
I'll have Ramil teach you

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.960
who rules and who serves.

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:45.650
Ramil,

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.360
step on his face.

00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:51.920
Do it!

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:00.520
I cannot obey, Father.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.280
You're testing my patience, aren't you?

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.880
I gave you an order.
Put your foot on his face.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.800
Do it!

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:22.760
Now.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.720
Step on his face!

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.940
Like that.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:54.150
Now, you finally see

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.490
who rules

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.200
and who serves.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.500
You're pathetic.

00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:21.930
All this time,

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:23.750
I've suffered.

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.280
I've felt small.

00:25:39.060 --> 00:25:40.640
But I endured it all because...

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.240
you were there with me.

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:46.530
Because I knew...

00:25:47.570 --> 00:25:49.160
you would protect me.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:51.200
I have always protected you, haven't I?

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.760
No one's ever dared to mess with you.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.400
But not Prince Rachata, right?

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.470
I did everything I could.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.680
Don't cry, Paytai.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:41.100
I must respectfully decline your order,
Your Royal Highness.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.600
I cannot do that.

00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:53.970
The matter between us...

00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.480
Please let it end here.

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:07.600
Do you even know what you're saying?

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:11.900
Though in private,

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.560
I consent to be your devoted servant...

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:18.480
Paytai...

00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:19.720
In real life,

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.650
I have my own dignity.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:27.360
And I wish to be honored

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.090
as your lover.

00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:34.410
Where are you going?

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.680
Thank you for protecting me.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:00.920
Thank you

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:04.640
for protecting
and taking care of the Assavadevathins.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.680
I'll be waiting over there, okay?

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.570
I know you loved roses, Mother.

00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.240
Protect, take care of,

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.120
and remain loyal to the Assavadevathins.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.100
I have fulfilled my duties...

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:12.230
as the leader of the Phithakthewa family,
just as you once were.

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.160
That was fast.

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:36.480
You can take your time.

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:37.630
I'll be fine.

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.560
Thank you.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:48.560
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

00:30:49.790 --> 00:30:51.100
His Majesty...

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.760
Following the recovery of His Majesty,

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:02.160
he has commanded me
to convene the royal clans.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.760
That is why
I've gathered you all here today.

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:09.340
We extend our heartfelt congratulations

00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:12.080
on the recovery of His Majesty.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:17.010
We offer congratulations
upon this blessed news.

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.100
Might we be allowed
to visit His Majesty now?

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:31.600
I appreciate your kind concern
for our clan.

00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.440
However, his condition remains delicate,

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.500
and it is not yet appropriate
to allow visitors for now.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
I thought today would be the day
we'd get to visit His Majesty.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.880
If we're not allowed to visit,
then what's the point...

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.800
of this convention?

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:54.240
His Majesty has issued a command
regarding the Royal Competition.

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:59.180
He wishes for the Competition
to proceed.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.360
He believes it is most fitting

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:20.400
that it be proceeded
in the traditional way,

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:25.280
with a final fencing match
to determine the victor.

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:27.830
With your permission,

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:30.700
I have an important matter to announce.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:32.950
You have my permission.

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:38.440
After careful consideration,

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:41.080
to ensure my heir's safety,

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:46.450
we shall no longer take part
in the Royal Competition.

00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:52.700
However,

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.300
the final decision rests with Ava,

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:58.240
my daughter and the pride of my clan.

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:03.800
You have devoted yourself fully
to your training.

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:07.040
The right to decide your participation

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.800
rightfully belongs to you.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:14.560
I shall prove myself to you, Father.

00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.920
Your archery skills are truly impressive,
Your Royal Highness.

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.680
I dedicated myself to training
because I didn't want to lose

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.120
and wanted to prove myself.

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:29.810
Thank you for your answer, Princess Ava.

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:32.960
You've also done a wonderful job
speaking up for equal rights.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:38.360
I wanted to prove that
being a woman didn't make me any less.

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.080
But all the mess in this Competition
has opened my eyes.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:52.440
It is not fair anymore, Ava.

00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:57.000
- Ava!
- Ava!

00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:00.640
I've realized that it's nothing more
than a game of power,

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.480
and I have nothing to prove to anyone.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:09.320
I, the heir of Davichmetha,
hereby withdraw.

00:34:14.489 --> 00:34:16.360
To summarize,

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.800
we shall proceed with the fencing match
between the two clans:

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.520
Assavadevathin and Bhuchongpisut.

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:24.510
Ramil,

00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:26.190
Khanin,

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.480
do you have any objections?

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:30.500
No, Your Royal Highness.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.139
Uh...

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:33.409
Father,

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.139
may I be permitted to speak?

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:39.650
You may.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:45.909
This may not be the most suitable time
to proceed with the Royal Competition.

00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:51.110
Would it not be better to wait
until His Majesty has fully recovered?

00:34:53.630 --> 00:34:54.900
That may not be possible.

00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.360
It was His Majesty himself who commanded

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:02.720
that the Competition continue
without delay.

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.550
We have yet another matter to disclose.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:20.390
The Royal Palace will announce that
Prince Wasin lost his life

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:22.800
in an accident during his travels.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:25.440
A condolence letter will also be sent

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.290
to the extended kin of Meenanagarin.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.540
That should be the best decision.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.760
But what shall become
of the governance of Meenanagarin

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.700
since Wasin had no heir?

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:45.300
Might it be wise to appoint
a qualified person to lead the region?

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.680
I am in agreement.

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:52.760
The Royal Palace must appoint a leader
with the suitable attributes.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.950
Ramil's proposal is commendable,

00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:59.990
yet it raises concerns that they may not
come from the Meenanagarin clan.

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:04.750
By withholding the truth for that clan,

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.680
we have shown enough respect.

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.720
Thus, I shall have the Royal Palace

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.340
select a suitable leader
for Meenanagarin,

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.380
after which we may convene
to discuss the matter again.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.440
May I ask why...

00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:20.570
the people of Meenanagarin
are not granted

00:36:20.610 --> 00:36:22.610
the right to choose their own leader?

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.300
That is indeed an intriguing question.

00:36:40.370 --> 00:36:42.350
I presume
you are referring to elections.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.340
Yes, Father.

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:51.810
I appreciate your frankness,

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:54.310
but I must decline.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.370
As for the leadership of Meenanagarin,

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.880
it shall proceed
as I have previously declared.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:25.180
Can we talk, dear?

00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.000
Father,

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:33.670
I...

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:38.630
Are you disappointed in me?

00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.840
I just thought...

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:53.720
maybe this was our chance
to bring about change.

00:37:57.490 --> 00:37:59.490
I know you want to bring change

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:03.250
to see democracy in Emmaly.

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:06.790
But there's only one way, dear.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.800
You must win the fencing match.

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:18.530
If we win, will you change
the way we rule, Father?

00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:22.520
I will do all that I can.

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:30.050
Then why did you reject me
in the convention just now?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.800
What you wanted

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.440
is for everyone there
to give up their power.

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:41.910
That's never an easy thing to ask, dear.

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.780
But would you...

00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:47.600
give it up?

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.400
If you win,

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:55.250
then wait and see what happens.

00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.600
Nin,

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.640
your grandfather wanted me
to tell you that

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.160
he's sorry.

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:23.590
Has news of the rebellion
been kept quiet?

00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.260
Yes, Father.

00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.220
Even the butler I trusted

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:33.280
could turn on me...

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:38.060
And I never suspected a thing.

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:43.810
Wirun has passed away, Father.

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:46.120
As he should.

00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.080
- Father... I'll go get the doctor.
- No need.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.400
I'm sorry, Tharin.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.640
I regret what I've done to you and...

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.200
Emmaly.

00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:17.480
But you did it all
for our family and nation.

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:21.470
Even if that excuse
paints me in a better light,

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:27.240
I'm still the one who set the path

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.000
and forced you to live that way
your whole life.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.530
Honestly, deep down,

00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:39.640
I might have been unhappy, too.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:52.680
Maybe not telling you about Khanin
might have hurt you a lot, right?

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.850
My apology

00:40:59.530 --> 00:41:01.650
might not help at all.

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:08.960
I was hurt before,

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.540
but that time is behind me now.

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:17.140
Let's work together
to fix what went wrong, shall we?

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.080
If I die before the Competition...

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.340
keep it a secret
until the fencing match is over.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:31.730
The news must be withheld
until the Royal Competition concludes.

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:35.170
How can I possibly do that?

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:41.660
My entire life
was to make Assavadevathin flourish.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:54.280
Even if I leave this world,
I won't stand in the way of its glory.

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:06.410
Khanin must bring the victory for sure.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.840
I have faith in him.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.990
Tell Khanin I'm sorry.

00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:33.800
He's deeply sorry
for having caused all of this.

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:38.320
Fence on behalf of the Assavadevathins

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:41.200
and bring victory for Emmaly,

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:43.140
can you?

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:33.950
What's wrong?

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:36.490
Worried about tomorrow?

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:39.750
I want to make things better for Emmaly

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.160
and make things right.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.480
But if I lose tomorrow...

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.980
Don't worry.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.080
Just do your best.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.220
I feel so much pressure.

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.680
A little pressure's not all bad.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.200
It can push you forward.

00:44:30.740 --> 00:44:32.540
But this is too much.

00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:34.760
I can't even sleep.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.320
If you can't sleep,

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.420
I'll stay up with you.

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:57.520
These are heavy.

00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:58.880
Can you handle them?

00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:03.560
Here you go.

00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:13.160
Good luck.

00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:17.270
En garde.
(On guard)

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:17.940
Prêts?
(Ready?)

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:20.650
Allez.
(Go)

00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:29.050
Allez.
(Go)

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:41.160
En garde.
(On guard)

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:41.940
Prêts?
(Ready?)

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:43.140
Allez.
(Go)

00:45:50.090 --> 00:45:51.500
Well done, dear.

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:52.950
That was incredible.

00:45:53.230 --> 00:45:54.300
You're the best!

00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.360
If you can even beat Charan,
we've got nothing to worry about.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.200
I'd like to challenge you next, Dad.

00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.280
Go get changed and come fight me!

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:08.960
Please.

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:10.080
Please...

00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.640
Fence with me.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.720
Wow, you're amazing.

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:25.140
Ready?

00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:26.340
- Watch out!
- Ouch!

00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:30.520
- Come on, Dad.
- Get me. Don't walk away.

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:32.280
Show me what you've got.

00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:33.840
What?

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.320
Get this!

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:38.280
Come on.

00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.440
Are you okay, Nin?

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:56.320
Yay, I won.

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.020
I won.

00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:05.700
You don't even try to change, huh?

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:36.460
Stop.

00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.220
Get up,

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.760
or you won't be able to beat Khanin.

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:43.350
Get up.

00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:05.940
Don't help him.

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:11.070
Get up, Ramil.

00:48:13.570 --> 00:48:14.590
Soon,

00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:18.160
we shall rise
and rule over this country.

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:19.960
Get up!

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:40.790
Shall we take a quick break?

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:48.780
Is Paytai here?

00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:52.160
He hasn't come here at all,
Your Royal Highness.

00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.240
You're looking after me now.
Are you fully recovered?

00:49:30.290 --> 00:49:31.920
I told you, Your Royal Highness.

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.940
I've been well
since the day you came to visit me.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.890
Good luck, Your Royal Highness.

00:50:26.970 --> 00:50:28.310
Don't forget to breathe.

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:31.870
Yes?

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.800
You need to breathe.

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:36.940
Breathe in.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:41.790
Breathe out.

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:47.520
Feeling better?

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.560
Good luck.

00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.540
You've got this.

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:10.950
Coming up next
is the Royal Fencing Competition

00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:18.110
between Prince Ramil Bhuchongpisut
and Prince Khanin Assavadevathin.

00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:23.550
May both princes
take their positions, please.

00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:28.280
This is the most historic match

00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:31.600
Emmaly has seen in decades

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.030
as it marks a duel

00:51:33.070 --> 00:51:37.870
between the clans
of Bhuchongpisut and Assavadevathin.

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:41.680
En garde.
(On guard)

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:49.860
Prêts?
(Ready?)

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:52.800
Allez.
(Go)

00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:29.800
I offer
my heartfelt congratulations to...

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:30.840
Grandfather...

00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.080
Khanin...

00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:35.360
I haven't changed my mind.

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:38.120
Just like I told you before,

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.120
I want nothing more
than an ordinary life.

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.480
Don't forget to call me
when you have time.

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.360
Call me often.

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:48.480
Goodbye, Mr. Charan.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.480
I, Chakri, am leaving for London.

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.000
The moment has come.

00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:05.080
♫Let love be our guide,♫

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:07.800
♫Let our hearts unite♫

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:16.440
♫From now on,
I'll let my heart decide♫

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:21.800
♫If the world won't take our side,♫

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:29.200
♫I'll leave their voices far behind♫

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:37.520
♫From now on, it's you and I♫

00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:43.320
♫Forget the rest,

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:47.800
