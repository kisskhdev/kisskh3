WEBVTT

00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:12.451

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.520
Why does he hate
the Phimarndech family so much?

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.200
He doesn't hate the whole family.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.200
Just one person.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.520
You're not being very nice.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.280
Always taking his side,
you like him or something?

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.160
You shouldn't be out here
flirting around like this.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.560
-Nina's starting to put pressure on us.
-I don't care.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.520
This one, I really like.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.840
Fire that girl.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.400
If you won't fire her,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.000
then make sure Nam breaks up with her
and marries Nina as soon as possible.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.040
You know they're Dad's enemies.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.680
The fights of the older generation
should stay with the older generation.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.200
I'll never stop hating them,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.120
until we take back
the company they stole from us.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.840
Toy, this is Mr. Apo, my boss.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.240
I'm Toy,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.200
her ex-boyfriend.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.760
I swear, the auntie who makes this

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.880
must've sold her soul to the devil

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.680
for flavor that perfect,
right to this sissy's core! Super-spicy…

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.440
So, Mr. Toy is…

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.800
LGBTQ.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.000
Come on, eat.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.280
About Toy…

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.720
Don't mind him teasing you, okay?

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.840
At first, I was going to mind.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.080
But when I found out
he's actually your close friend,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.120
not your ex,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.120
I felt a lot better.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.760
Right.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.040
I'll be honest with you.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.640
I like you, Ms. Sarah.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.000
Since the first time I saw you.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.720
And I'd like to ask for a chance.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.440
Would you consider giving me one?

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.560
You're a sweet guy.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.720
But…

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.200
But what?

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.360
It's not you. It's me.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.040
I'm not ready.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.400
Right now, I want to focus on my work

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.800
and take better care of my family.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.240
That's okay. I won't rush you.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.120
As long as you don't mind,

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:45.360
I'll keep waiting

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.720
and keep proving myself to you.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.400
Thank you.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.000
Mr. Din, your lunch is here.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.040
Thanks.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.120
Look at you.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.160
It's Sunday. You should be home relaxing.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.480
But no, you're here,
working seven days a week.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.200
Take care of your health, okay?

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.000
There's plenty of time to rest later.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.600
Right now, I need
to find ways to cut expenses

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.240
and boost revenue as soon as possible.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.840
You can go ahead, Uncle Perm.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.080
I'll stay and work tonight,
then head home after that.

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.000
Why can't I ever win the lottery
as easily as I can predict this?

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.720
I knew you'd still be working late,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.600
so I ordered an extra meal just in case.
Don't forget to eat, okay?

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.520
I worry about you. Good night.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.519
‎You're probably sleeping here, right?

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:18.760
Please take care.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.920
-Thank you.
-Yes, sir.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.600
Finally done.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.120
A thief?

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.320
Stop right there, you thief!

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.440
I gave up my overtime,
and you attack me instead?

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.720
How was I supposed to know it was you?

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.040
Who comes to work on a Sunday?

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.640
And this late at night?

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.560
Are you saying I'm weird?

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.960
That's not what I meant.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.720
So…

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:45.000
What are you doing here anyway?

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.520
Well, I just moved closer to the office.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.680
I was bored, didn't know what to do,
so I came in to work.

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.240
You should be proud, actually.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.960
Having such a dedicated employee like me.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.760
Alright.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.280
Okay. I'm sorry
I almost hit you in the face.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.520
I'll be more careful next time.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.440
Good.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.000
Anyway, I'm heading out.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.160
Wait.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.280
I thought you'd be mad at me
and wouldn't come eat.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.080
I am mad.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.920
But I have to save money too.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.600
By the way, you didn't know
I was here working, right?

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.520
Why'd you order two meals?

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.040
I actually ordered lunch
and dinner for myself,

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.920
but I got caught up working
and forgot to eat. So, lucky you.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.440
Now I feel bad.

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.160
I basically stole one of your meals.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.280
Anyway…

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.760
Thanks again

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.120
for the free dinner.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.000
But next time,

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.200
try eating on time, okay?
Take care of yourself a little.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.240
Are you…

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.680
worried about me?

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:23.600
No.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.800
It's called…

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.080
acting.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.480
In case it gets me a raise.

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.560
My father suddenly needs a big lump sum.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.560
Otherwise, you two

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.320
wouldn't be scrambling
to find the money like this.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.280
It's no trouble.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.640
If not now, we'd have had to do it
another day anyway.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.600
That's a relief to hear.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:11.720
Uh…

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.240
And Father asked me
to mention one more thing.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.440
About the new loan we talked about,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.760
he may want to reconsider.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.400
Is there a problem?

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.880
We've always paid the interest on time.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.680
Honestly, Father told me not to say this,

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.360
but since we've known each other so long,

00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.600
I'll tell you.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.200
Your company
borrowed money from my father,

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.720
but there's no collateral.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.400
Even if we're close,

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.960
he still has to be cautious.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.880
You know what they say,

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.960
money cuts deeper than a knife.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:06.640
It can even sever relationships.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.520
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:15.560
Goodbye. Goodbye.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.960
Do you know how humiliating it was for me

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.880
to pawn my jewelry
just to cover your interest payment?

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.520
And look at you.

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.840
You can't get a single thing done.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.880
Can't secure another loan.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.000
Can't even get Nam to marry Nina.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.800
What can I rely on you for, huh?

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.600
Or how about this?

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:49.680
Go get that girl yourself,
beat Nam to it, and end this mess.

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.880
This is real life, Mom,

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.320
not some K-drama
where everything's that complicated.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.080
Then listen to me.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.640
If you run PD into the ground,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.320
don't say I didn't warn you.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:22.920
Oh, Nina.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.080
-Oh, Nam!
-What are you doing here?

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:27.240
I'm here on my father's business.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.040
Are you free today?

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.000
-Let's get lunch. I know a place--
-Uh, not today.

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.040
I've got to go discuss something
with Ms. Sarah.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.520
Oh, I see.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.080
Catch you later then.

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.040
Mhm.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.240
So, you're that stressed,
you had to take it out on me?

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:05.800
Let me guess. This is about Nam.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.440
You know me.

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.040
I don't get it.
What's so great about that guy?

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.320
Why are you so dead set on him?

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.960
I'm way better than he is,

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.600
especially at…

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.640
If you're good at that with
everyone else, I'm out. Hard pass.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.600
If marriage means constantly stressing

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.720
over who my man's shacking up with today,

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.320
ugh, headache.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.080
So, why'd you call me here?

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:48.640
What do you want?

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.800
I need your advice.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.680
Don't you want to know

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.760
what the girl Nam's crazy about
looks like?

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.040
So, you mean…

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:07.240
you want me to go after her or…

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.600
destroy her?

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.760
Figure out

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.080
which one would please me more.

00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.960
-As discussed, alright?
-Yes.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.320
Do you have a minute? I want to talk.

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.840
Since when do you just
open someone's door and walk in?

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.880
Can we talk now?

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.680
Uncle Perm, proceed as discussed.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.480
Keep me posted.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.920
Yes, Mr. Din.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.480
Knock, knock.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.120
You wanted to talk?

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.800
This is the new product.

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.960
An affordable gift set for office workers,

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.360
easy to carry,
with full benefits, sun protection,

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.120
and facial care.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:49.520
After our talk last night, I got inspired,

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.720
so I made a tester.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.040
This formula uses low-cost ingredients,

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.360
but the quality matches, or even beats,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.760
what you've got in the lineup now.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.200
-You came up with a formula in one night?
-Mhm.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.400
Of course. Who do you think I am?

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.200
I'm Sarah.

00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.960
Are you sure it actually works?

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.040
That's why I want you to test it yourself.

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.840
With your delicate, pampered,
super-sensitive skin,

00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.920
you're the perfect little test subject.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.680
-Come here.
-Hey.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.240
Don't panic.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.480
I swear on my own head
you won't have an allergic reaction.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.120
Oh!

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.920
Hey, you!

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.320
What a mess!

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.760
Ugh.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:16.040
Let me help.

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.320
Where are they?

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.560
Krit, you never told me why you wanted me

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.920
to come along today.

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.320
I heard their new R&amp;D hire is really good,

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.040
so I wanted to meet her myself.
Maybe we'll work together someday.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.120
Work together?

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:55.920
With you?

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.720
Why not?

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.280
I've already bought
a fair chunk of shares here.

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.320
One day, I'll buy the whole company.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.440
Think of it as the future owner
doing an early site visit.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:28.720
Hey.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.400
Mr. Din?

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:33.240
Are you reacting to the cream?
Can you breathe?

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.480
No reaction.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.920
But it absorbed fast and felt so mellow.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.160
So, I was kinda…
mellowing right into sleep.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.480
You.

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.440
You think that's funny?

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.920
So, how is it? Okay?

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.880
Yeah, feels good. I feel like

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.920
my skin's soft,
and there's no itch at all.

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.920
And that's just the cream.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.280
There's a serum too, and let me tell you…

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.920
It's fabulous.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.160
This one's quick-absorb too.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.800
That's the idea.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:07.760
Din.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.720
Can we talk?

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.840
You're trying to wind me up,
getting that close to Ms. Sarah?

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.440
Hey. Calm down, Nam.

00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.480
We were just testing products, that's all.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.880
Testing, huh?
You really think I'm that stupid?

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.120
Just admit it, you like her.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.280
Go get that girl yourself, beat Nam to it,

00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:49.560
and end this mess.

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:56.520
Yeah.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.440
I like Ms. Sarah.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.560
Din!

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.320
What?

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.920
You're the only one allowed to like her?

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:12.960
I like her too.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.640
And I'm going to pursue her.

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.120
Well…

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.040
We were just…

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.200
messing around like brothers do.

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:33.120
Right, Din?

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:38.960
Right.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.760
You two sure joke harshly.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.000
But when I said I like you,

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.760
I wasn't joking.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.400
I'll get back to work.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.360
Wait, Ms. Sarah.

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.440
I may not flirt as smooth as you,

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.080
but making a woman uncomfortable,

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.520
that's just dumb.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:31.640
-Hey.
-Let go, Krit.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.320
-Come on.
-Let go.

00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:38.520
Let me go, Krit. Let go.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.960
Let me go, Krit. It hurts!

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.040
Krit, why are you dragging me out?

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.000
You said you were here
to talk business with Din?

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.160
Even if I did come because of Din,

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.080
I'm not letting you chase after him.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.560
And why not?

00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.000
You still don't get it?

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.400
If you go to him
right after what just happened,

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.160
what's that gonna look like?

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.320
Jealousy is written all over your face.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.040
Because you hate

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.560
that Din's into someone else.

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.800
Am I right?

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.680
You're overthinking it.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.960
Morning, Ms. Sarah.

00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:47.840
Morning, Mr. Nam.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.720
Did you want to talk about something?

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.520
I was wondering

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:07.680
if I should tell you this.

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.200
Tell me what?

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:15.280
If it's that you like me,
no need to repeat it.

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.080
I got the message.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.120
It's not that.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.560
My mom wants me to marry someone,

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.680
and it affects
whether the company survives.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.200
But…

00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.920
But I'm not into her.

00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:40.240
And about Din trying to go after you,

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.120
I can see through it.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.880
He wants me to give up on you,

00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:48.760
so I'll go marry that girl instead.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.520
Well,

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.200
what I told you just now, Ms. Sarah,

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:02.800
I only wanted you to know the whole truth.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.960
So you'd also know

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.320
that I'm sincere,

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.520
and I'm serious about you.

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.840
If you'd just give me a chance,

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:20.040
could you open your heart to me?

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.400
I should go to work.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.120
Please go ahead.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.320
Thank you.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.080
-Hey, calm down.
-Calm down.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.120
Did you even read the script?

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:01.240
We've done eight takes.
How can you say I didn't?

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:02.280
You're just biased.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.680
Before you call me biased,
did you even understand the role?

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.440
Nueng said the lead has to be furious.

00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:09.760
I am furious.

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:11.400
Still not enough for you?!

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.000
How mad do you want?

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.640
Angry is one thing,
but the character needs to be hurt too.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.600
He's never hit a woman.
The moment he does, it crushes him.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.400
And what is this?
Eight takes and not a shred of remorse.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.680
If I can't ask whether you read it,
what can I ask?!

00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.240
-What?
-Hey, hold up.

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.680
What? Your acting sucks.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.040
And you want to pick fights?

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.920
-Go on then, hit me.
-Bring it.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.440
Guys, cool it!

00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.200
We're friends.
What's the point of fighting?

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.720
Alright, 15-minute break.
We'll shoot again after.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.640
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.000
You do it.

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:02.840
-You go.
-Come on. Hurry up.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:07.680
Here, have some water.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.240
Say what you've got to say.

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.400
Well…

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.080
It's about Rach.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.560
You know his dream is to be a director.

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.640
That's why he gets too serious.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.080
Yeah.

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.600
He probably regrets snapping at you.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.760
Let us apologize on his behalf, okay?

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.440
-Please?
-Come on, Yo.

00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.200
-It's nothing.
-We're friends, right?

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.520
Fine, I get it.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.600
I actually messed up too.
My acting wasn't great.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.040
Made everyone waste time
with all those takes.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.280
I'll talk to him myself.

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.160
Damn it!

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.720
Sorry, Cherry.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.360
No need to apologize.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.760
Hey… Are you okay?

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.640
I'll be, once the shoot's done.

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.160
I'm worried and…

00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:31.120
I'm worried

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.760
because…

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.800
I like you, Sarach.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.120
Let's talk about this later.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.000
We should get back to work.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.320
I'll make you like me back,

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:06.920
Sarach.

00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.760
Smells nice. Lotion?

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.480
First things first.

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.200
Why are you here?

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:50.400
Tomorrow,

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.160
you're coming into the field with me.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.680
What?

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.080
Not even old yet
and already hard of hearing?

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.160
Why do I have to go?

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.200
I'm visiting the community enterprise
you recommended.

00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.720
If you don't come,
who am I supposed to go with?

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.360
What are you wearing?

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.080
I should be asking you that.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.800
Does your closet

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.200
have anything besides work suits?

00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.120
What?

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.720
I'm going to work.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:29:59.080
You're the one

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.800
dressed for the savanna.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:04.800
Planning to ride a lion?

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.160
You said we're going into the field.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:10.440
I dressed to get my hands dirty.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:14.920
Suit yourself. So, please.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.680
Go hop on your lion then.

00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:47.000
Oh, Mom.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:48.920
Din's not home yet?

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:50.480
Not yet.

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.520
Is something wrong? It's late.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.400
Maybe he's stuck in traffic.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.720
You'll see when he gets back.

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.560
You're tired.
Go shower and get some sleep.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.320
Stop worrying about everyone else.

00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.640
But…

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.720
Thanks for keeping me company
the whole way today.

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:37.760
It's alright.
That's what travel buddies are for.

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:41.840
Anyway, you've had a long day.

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:45.320
Go shower and get some rest.
I won't bother you.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:46.920
And you…

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.160
Drive safe, okay?

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.560
I will.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.280
Hello?

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Dad?

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.000
How is he?

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:24.800
He's stable now.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.240
-Dad.
-Sara…

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:43.840
You called her, didn't you?

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.880
I told you there was no need.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.800
Yeah, I got busted.

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.840
Dad, don't scold him.

00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:56.280
It's just us.
Of course we tell each other.

00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.880
Alright.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:08.520
Mr. Din.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.320
It really is you.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:18.680
It's been, what, ten years?

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.560
Even when you came to our house,
we missed each other.

00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:23.560
Didn't think you'd remember me.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.840
Of course I do.

00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.560
Sarach, did you greet him?

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.080
I did.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.600
Din.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.160
You've grown up, huh?

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.760
What?

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.960
You look like you just hit
the jackpot, Moopook.

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:51.280
You know who I am?

00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:52.720
Since when?

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.560
-Easy, Moopook.
-Hey.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.560
Don't call me that.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.360
Since I saw your full name
on the application.

00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.600
It's been a while.

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:10.920
You look completely different.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.120
Please bring her in for the interview.

00:34:13.199 --> 00:34:14.480
Sure.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:18.000
But when you said your name was Sarah,

00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.800
I hesitated.

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.000
Could've been someone with a similar name.

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.239
And…

00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.239
How were you sure it was me?

00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.320
When we got stuck in the elevator.

00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:33.560
Hey. Are you okay?

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:35.719
I…

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.400
I'm claustrophobic.

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.199
You haven't changed a bit.

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:48.520
Hey,

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.440
if you knew from the start,
why didn't you say something?

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.360
You knew too and stayed quiet.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:55.639
Wait, wait.

00:34:55.719 --> 00:34:57.360
So,

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.520
you're working with Mr. Din now?

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.400
Yes, Uncle.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.360
Your daughter's diligent,
hardworking, and smart.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.360
She won't let you down.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.640
Good.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.600
Working with someone we know

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:18.560
puts me at ease.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.960
Sara,

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.520
why didn't you tell me about this?

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.600
How long were you planning
to hide that you knew me?

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.520
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.880
Hey, don't turn it back on me.

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.200
Just being honest.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:06.280
Update me on what
the doctor says tomorrow.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.600
With respect,
I won't report personal matters.

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.440
I'm not asking for a report.

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:16.000
Just keep me in the loop.
I worry about Uncle Suthee too.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.120
Can you not argue with me for once?

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.920
Can you just listen and do it?

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.200
-Hey--
-Ah!

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:26.640
This is a hospital. Keep it down.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:28.920
Bye-bye.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:01.360
Make yourself at home, Nina. Don't be shy.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.640
Thank you.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.880
Warms the heart, doesn't it?

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.960
Like newlyweds.

00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:16.040
Auntie…

00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.600
Eat up, dear.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:21.520
Honestly, I do this
for all my female friends.

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.760
A lot of couples start as friends

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.720
and end up together.

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.040
Well, you're not wrong.

00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:37.240
If they haven't met the right one yet.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.880
But once they have,

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.440
friends should stay just friends.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.760
Thank you for breakfast.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.360
It's nothing.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:38:00.160
Come by every day if you like.
Keep me company.

00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:03.280
Depends if I get anything in return.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.800
The loan

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:09.200
and the shares you asked about,

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.080
it's all investment.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.120
If it turns into a sunk cost

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.120
or the return isn't worth it,

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:20.240
I can't exactly
persuade my father to help.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.520
You understand me, right, Auntie?

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.200
I do.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:29.720
I'll be going now.

00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.080
Yesterday,
I took Ms. Sarah out to the field.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.640
The car broke down, we got caught
in the rain, came back late.

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.840
-End of story.
-Work excuses again.

00:38:54.440 --> 00:38:57.560
You spent the whole day with her,
till late at night.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.560
Don't think I can't read you.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.800
You're such a cheat.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.280
If you're gonna go after Ms. Sarah,

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.560
at least play fair.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.800
You really like her that much, huh?

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.400
You already know. Why even ask?

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.840
So, what is it you like about her?

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:18.680
Her looks? Her brains? Her job?

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.680
Everything about her.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.160
Then let me tell you something.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.000
Sarah, or Sara,

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:34.720
is that pimple-faced,
thick-browed, tick-chinned girl,

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.160
the daughter of Uncle Suthee,
you used to look down on.

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:41.680
-Give it back!
-Does Sara have a crush on Nam?

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.560
-Give it!
-You pimple-faced, thick-browed,

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.000
dog tick on your chin!

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:49.040
-Be a couple!
-Give it back!

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.040
Give it…

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.440
Let's play dolls!

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.280
Dolls? Ugh, so annoying.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.400
Who'd even want to play with you?

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.880
Here, this is to make up
for the other day.

00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.040
What are you plotting now?

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:48.080
Are you crazy?

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.800
Why'd you bring that woman back
to see Din?

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:53.480
I just told her
to go check on him, that's all.

00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:56.440
Your father's muscular heart disease

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.400
has been getting worse, and right now,

00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.760
it's reached a critical stage.

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.400
But I can help you. It's just that…

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.400
You'll have to marry me.

00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:52.280
