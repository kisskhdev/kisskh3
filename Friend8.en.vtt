00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:37.334
So, Madam Mali told me that...

00:01:37.334 --> 00:01:40.209
She thinks she saw a thief at our shop

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:42.167
Huh? Thief!!!!

00:01:42.167 --> 00:01:43.834
And then he saw something like someone

00:01:43.834 --> 00:01:46.542
It's popping up and disappearing behind our shop too.

00:01:46.542 --> 00:01:49.918
Oh, that's scary

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:54.918
Sister Linlin

00:01:54.918 --> 00:01:57.918
If you haven't become a girlfriend with that handsome guy yet,

00:02:01.751 --> 00:02:03.292
Can I be your girlfriend?

00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:33.918
Thank you

00:02:33.918 --> 00:02:39.751
Um...what should I call you?

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:46.876
I'm gonna call you Lai.

00:02:46.876 --> 00:02:50.375
It's cool!

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:56.250
Nope, still Lai. It's a cute name

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.417
Thanks, Lai.

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:09.209
Oh!!

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.250
Oops, sorry, I forgot to knock on the door.

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.959
It's okay

00:03:15.042 --> 00:03:18.292
Hey, how is that possible?

00:03:18.292 --> 00:03:20.584
Why are you in such a good mood today?

00:03:21.042 --> 00:03:23.918
If it were before, I would have been scolded until I went deaf.

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.000
Are you feeling unwell?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.959
I'm good or do you want me to scold you instead?

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:31.626
I'm so ready.

00:03:31.626 --> 00:03:32.584
Oh, it's okay.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.584
What about Thun and Achi? They good to go?

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.250
Yeah, they're ready.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.000
I only came cause I was following you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Let's go.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.417
Ummmm

00:03:53.292 --> 00:03:58.751
Wowwww

00:03:58.751 --> 00:03:59.459

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.709
Hello friends, we are

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.417
Traveling couple

00:04:03.417 --> 00:04:04.083
I'm Tun

00:04:04.083 --> 00:04:04.834
And Achi

00:04:04.834 --> 00:04:07.125
Yeahh

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:09.918
Now we are living in the countryside.

00:04:09.918 --> 00:04:10.792
Yes, everyone,

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:14.334
let me tell you that this place is very beautiful.

00:04:14.334 --> 00:04:16.209
Here everyone, I'll show you the inside on the right.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.125
Oops, Tun

00:04:18.125 --> 00:04:18.876
No problem, lets continue.

00:04:18.876 --> 00:04:22.751
On the right side, this is the cafe zone.

00:04:22.751 --> 00:04:24.584
And the part behind us

00:04:24.584 --> 00:04:28.167
It will be a private part of the resort.

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:30.542
It's a very natural feel for everyone.

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:33.667
And I would like to tell you that the two of us are staying here.

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:34.542
That's right.

00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:36.500
Hey, are you curious about what it's like inside?

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.417
Let's go and take a look.

00:04:38.417 --> 00:04:40.542
Let's keep going.

00:04:40.542 --> 00:04:42.083
Let's GOOOO

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:42.667
Come quickly.

00:04:42.667 --> 00:04:43.292
Go fast.

00:04:44.292 --> 00:04:45.334
Follow me. Follow me.

00:04:45.334 --> 00:04:48.209
Wow everyone!

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:51.959
And this is the organic vegetable garden of...

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:51.999
Yes, that's right.
And this is the organic vegetable garden of...

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:52.918
Yes, that's right.

00:04:52.918 --> 00:04:55.375
And all the vegetables that everyone sees

00:04:55.375 --> 00:04:59.250
This way, they will collect them for us to eat.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.042
Can it be eaten right away?

00:05:01.042 --> 00:05:03.083
Tun, it has to be washed first

00:05:03.083 --> 00:05:04.792
Oh no

00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:06.667
I cant wait

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:08.542
Let me take you to see the suite.

00:05:08.542 --> 00:05:10.709
Huh?!

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:11.584
The room we're staying in?

00:05:11.584 --> 00:05:14.250
Okay, let's see how it is

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.959
I can't wait any longer.

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:16.334
Let's go.

00:05:16.334 --> 00:05:16.709

Here it is, everyone.

00:05:23.751 --> 00:05:25.667
We're home now.

00:05:25.667 --> 00:05:27.125
Ban Fon Raleummm

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:29.792
Whoa, hey!

00:05:29.792 --> 00:05:31.209
Oh, it's Khun Lalin!

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:32.667
Khun Thun, Khun Achi

00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:35.751
make yourselves at home, okay?

00:05:35.751 --> 00:05:36.375

00:05:36.375 --> 00:05:37.626
Please come.

00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:37.918
Go

00:05:37.918 --> 00:05:39.417
Let's continue, everyone.

00:05:39.417 --> 00:05:41.626
Here, Tun go quickly

00:05:41.626 --> 00:05:43.584
Come on, hey!

00:05:43.584 --> 00:05:48.542
Hmm, they are so cute together.

00:05:48.542 --> 00:05:51.876
It's true. I've never seen a celebrity who is cute.

00:05:51.876 --> 00:05:54.292
And you've always been this friendly.

00:05:54.292 --> 00:05:56.417
Recently, I have been completely smitten.

00:05:56.417 --> 00:05:58.375
I follow every channel.

00:05:58.375 --> 00:05:59.250
Really?

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.751
Yeah

00:06:00.751 --> 00:06:03.334
No freakin’ way, Khun Lalin? Seriously?

00:06:03.334 --> 00:06:07.417
Oh yeah, why? Can't I be a fan?!

00:06:07.417 --> 00:06:10.292
Awesome!

00:06:10.292 --> 00:06:11.167
The latest one

00:06:11.167 --> 00:06:14.459
Khun Thun and Khun Achi just went live on the page!

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:15.083
Where?

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.876
There are so many people commenting here.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.042
Can I see P'Lalin?

00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:20.167
Here

00:06:20.167 --> 00:06:21.250
It's true.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.417
We will also be able to thank our customers.

00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:24.500
uh huh

00:06:30.626 --> 00:06:33.542
Look at it

00:06:33.542 --> 00:06:36.918
Wow, the room is so beautiful.

00:06:36.918 --> 00:06:45.125
Everyone, look at this. This room is so nice and cute.

00:06:45.125 --> 00:06:47.417
It's so airy and comfortable, everyone.

00:06:47.417 --> 00:06:48.667
Yeah, try to sit

00:06:48.667 --> 00:06:50.167
How is it?

00:06:50.167 --> 00:06:53.042
The bed is very soft.

00:06:53.042 --> 00:06:55.876
Oh my god, what is this!!

00:06:55.876 --> 00:06:58.000
Read it.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.999
Welcome, Tun and Achi.

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:03.876
Have a nice time at Baan Nok Kok Naa

00:07:03.876 --> 00:07:05.584
Thank you for traveling here.

00:07:05.584 --> 00:07:07.375
Wow, everyone is so cute!

00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:08.417
Here

00:08:08.417 --> 00:08:10.792
The view outside must be beautiful.

00:08:10.792 --> 00:08:12.167
-Let's go see.
-Hey, let's go see.

00:08:12.167 --> 00:08:14.584
Come, come.

00:08:14.584 --> 00:08:17.584
Oh wow! Wow!

00:08:17.584 --> 00:08:21.709
Wow!

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:23.042
So slippery!

00:08:23.042 --> 00:08:24.792
It's perfect for relaxing and de-stressing, isn't it?

00:08:24.792 --> 00:08:25.751
Hmm.

00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:29.709
Wow, it's so easy on the eyes, everyone.

00:08:29.709 --> 00:08:35.125
For those who want to relax in a peaceful and private atmosphere

00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:38.083
But surrounded by the freshness of nature like this

00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:40.292
Ashi and I highly recommend it.

00:08:40.292 --> 00:08:43.792
You will fall in love with the countryside like the two of us.

00:08:43.792 --> 00:08:47.334
Yes, an ordinary resort that is not ordinary.

00:08:47.334 --> 00:08:49.626
Yes, it's country music with style.

00:08:49.626 --> 00:08:51.375
Don't forget to stop by, everyone!

00:08:51.375 --> 00:08:52.334
Please come visit us.

00:09:05.999 --> 00:09:09.125
Wooow, Thun and Achi, you guys are awesome!"

00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:10.042
Oh, Khun Lalin!

00:09:10.042 --> 00:09:11.250
thank you

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:12.709
Yesss

00:09:12.709 --> 00:09:14.459
Here you go, water

00:09:14.459 --> 00:09:15.751
Got it

00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:16.584
Thank you

00:09:16.584 --> 00:09:22.500
Oh, you're always so cute.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.209
What's up Tienhom?

00:09:24.209 --> 00:09:25.542
Wanna use the bathroom or what?"

00:09:25.542 --> 00:09:28.542
Oh, come on, Khun Lalin.

00:09:28.542 --> 00:09:30.334
You'll get used to it after seeing it every day.

00:09:30.334 --> 00:09:32.876
Because the two of us

00:09:32.918 --> 00:09:37.417
are always this cute, you know

00:09:37.459 --> 00:09:39.000
Right?

00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:39.999
Thuuunn

00:09:39.999 --> 00:09:42.626
Khun Lin, we don’t have to stay here anymore.

00:09:42.626 --> 00:09:45.042
Yeah, true. What should we do now?

00:09:45.042 --> 00:09:48.292
What?

00:09:48.292 --> 00:09:49.459
Thanks so much!

00:09:49.459 --> 00:09:50.500
Thank youuu!

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:51.083
Oops

00:09:51.083 --> 00:09:52.834
All done, yayyy

00:10:20.125 --> 00:10:21.125
Oops!

00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:21.500
Hello, Ms. Lin.
Oops!

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.792
Hello, Ms. Lin.

00:10:22.792 --> 00:10:24.125
I'm in a really good mood.

00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:25.751
How are you today?

00:10:25.751 --> 00:10:28.042
Ummmm

00:10:28.042 --> 00:10:29.209
I'm sorry.

00:10:29.209 --> 00:10:32.209
Today, there is berry rice coming in.

00:10:32.209 --> 00:10:34.250
There is a tie-dyed cloth from my aunt.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.500
And then there's herbal tea from grandpa.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.999
Already kept in stock.

00:10:39.999 --> 00:10:41.709
Great job!

00:10:53.709 --> 00:10:55.542
Go ahead, get back to the booth

00:10:58.584 --> 00:11:01.667
Is there a lot left, Jin?

00:11:01.667 --> 00:11:05.000
Heyyy!!!

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.709
Oh, come on, let me help.

00:11:06.709 --> 00:11:09.792
Nah, it's okay, I'm got this.

00:11:09.792 --> 00:11:10.375
Really?

00:11:10.375 --> 00:11:14.083
Yeah, no worries. Just go home and rest.
Jin will handle it.

00:11:14.083 --> 00:11:15.834
Alright, I won't be shy then.

00:11:15.834 --> 00:11:17.999
Okay, let’s go.

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:19.500
Sounds good.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.125
-My back's killing me today.
-Right?

00:11:22.125 --> 00:11:23.834
I was just thinking of taking some muscle

00:11:23.834 --> 00:11:24.876
And then go to sleep.

00:11:25.209 --> 00:11:27.667
Ugh, I can’t bend over anymore

00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:29.042
Come on, Jin, let me help you.

00:11:29.042 --> 00:11:30.876
Nah, it’s okay.

00:11:30.876 --> 00:11:31.834
Kanit doesn’t need to.

00:11:31.834 --> 00:11:33.918
It’s my job. I will handle it

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:40.375
But why’s Jin working so slowly these days?

00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:43.375
Are you feeling okay?

00:11:43.375 --> 00:11:45.292
Look at your face

00:11:45.292 --> 00:11:48.959
You look exhausted, like you haven’t been sleeping well.

00:11:48.959 --> 00:11:50.626
Yeah, that’s true

00:11:50.626 --> 00:11:52.584
Yeah, true.

00:11:52.584 --> 00:11:55.876
I don’t think it’s because of lots of customers, Jin.

00:11:55.876 --> 00:11:58.751
Cause lately we’ve had way more customers than this

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:00.667
But Jin used to get things done super fast

00:12:00.667 --> 00:12:02.459
You finished before us in a moment.

00:12:02.459 --> 00:12:03.417
Yeah, that’s right.

00:12:03.417 --> 00:12:03.999
Uh-huh

00:12:03.999 --> 00:12:05.834
And you even helped us out a lot

00:12:05.834 --> 00:12:06.626
Exactly!

00:12:06.626 --> 00:12:11.667
But look now, wow, no one’s helping us at all

00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:14.834
Wait, wait, don't say too much

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:17.959
I saw Jin help him out a bit, so he went all out.

00:12:17.959 --> 00:12:20.209
This is clearly taking advantage of each other.

00:12:20.209 --> 00:12:21.500
I'll deduct the salaries of these two people.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.375
Then let Jin have it, okay?

00:12:22.375 --> 00:12:24.876
Nooo, Kanit

00:12:24.876 --> 00:12:27.375
We promise, we won’t do this again

00:12:27.375 --> 00:12:29.292
Promise!"

00:12:29.292 --> 00:12:31.125
Yeah, the two of us are really sorry, Jinnn

00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:32.167
Sorryyy

00:12:32.167 --> 00:12:33.876
It’s okay, no worries

00:12:33.876 --> 00:12:36.375
By the way, your back hurts, right?

00:12:36.375 --> 00:12:36.959
Oh

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:37.834
-yeah
-Then, should we left?

00:12:37.834 --> 00:12:38.375
Okay, then

00:12:38.375 --> 00:12:39.334
Yeah, better go home

00:12:39.334 --> 00:12:40.209
Okay, then

00:12:40.209 --> 00:12:41.292
Gotta go now

00:12:41.292 --> 00:12:44.709
-Byeee
-Take care

00:12:53.709 --> 00:12:55.459
Hey!!!

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.292
Why the face?

00:12:57.292 --> 00:12:58.834
I mean, isn’t it annoying?

00:12:58.834 --> 00:13:01.167
Letting those two take advantage like that

00:13:01.167 --> 00:13:04.250
It’s okay, we’re just helping each other out

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.042
But it shouldn’t happen every day, right?

00:13:07.042 --> 00:13:08.834
If it keeps happening

00:13:08.834 --> 00:13:13.584
Next time those two will face serious consequences

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:16.292
So… are you done yet?

00:13:16.292 --> 00:13:19.167
Almost there, see? Just a few more left

00:13:19.167 --> 00:13:20.500
Kanit, you should go home first

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:24.125
Nooo, I can’t leave yet. I have to wait for you

00:13:24.125 --> 00:13:25.584
It’s okay

00:13:25.584 --> 00:13:28.834
Wait, Kanit walked out.

00:13:28.834 --> 00:13:30.500
Jin followed closely.

00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:37.459
Okay, Kanit’s leaving now

00:13:37.459 --> 00:13:39.083
Mhm, heading out

00:13:39.083 --> 00:13:41.167
Jin will close up the shop

00:13:41.167 --> 00:13:43.292
Okayyy

00:13:43.292 --> 00:13:44.834
I’m go now

00:13:44.834 --> 00:13:46.250
Take care going home

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:57.167
Always charging my phone and then leaving it behind

00:14:57.292 --> 00:15:01.999
Why am I like this?

00:15:17.209 --> 00:15:19.999
A thief?!

00:15:53.834 --> 00:15:54.999
Hey, nooo!

00:15:54.999 --> 00:15:56.876
Jin!

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:03.000
Kanit!

00:16:03.834 --> 00:16:06.417
What are you doing here?

00:16:13.083 --> 00:16:17.542
Why are you sleeping at the shop?

00:16:17.542 --> 00:16:20.959
Sigh

00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:26.042
I'm got some problem in the room

00:16:26.042 --> 00:16:31.542
Sleeping under the blanket like that isn’t ‘a little problem, Jin

00:16:31.542 --> 00:16:37.500
And those mosquito bites — those are from the shop, right?

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:41.626
Yeah

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:45.375
Phew, good thing you didn’t get dengue fever or something

00:16:45.375 --> 00:16:49.334
What were you thinking sleeping at the shop like that?

00:16:49.334 --> 00:16:52.999
It’s dangerous, you know

00:16:52.999 --> 00:16:57.209
Even if it’s our shop

00:16:57.209 --> 00:17:00.667
Sorry

00:17:00.667 --> 00:17:03.375
Even though our shop is in the resort

00:17:03.375 --> 00:17:06.000
the place is really big

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.584
Customers come and go all the time

00:17:08.584 --> 00:17:12.042
The fence around is not secure at all, you don’t know how dangerous it is

00:17:12.042 --> 00:17:15.042
We can’t just rely on the security guard, right?

00:17:15.042 --> 00:17:18.209
You gotta take care of yourself too, Jin

00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:20.834
If something happens, it won’t be worth it

00:17:27.667 --> 00:17:32.417
It’s driving me crazy

00:17:33.334 --> 00:17:35.500
I’m really sorry, Kanit

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:40.083
I just don’t know where else to stay

00:17:40.083 --> 00:17:44.834
How many nights have you been sleeping here?

00:17:44.834 --> 00:17:45.918
Over a week

00:17:45.918 --> 00:17:47.792
What?

00:17:47.792 --> 00:17:49.334
Over a week??!

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:51.000
How could you sleep here that long?

00:17:56.751 --> 00:18:00.918
So what are you gonna do next?

00:18:00.918 --> 00:18:05.125
Is it that serious that you can’t go home?

00:18:05.125 --> 00:18:07.667
Or should Kanit take you home?

00:18:07.667 --> 00:18:09.459
Nooo

00:18:09.459 --> 00:18:10.751
I don’t want to go home

00:18:10.751 --> 00:18:13.918
I really can’t go home anymore

00:18:13.918 --> 00:18:16.292
So where will you go?

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.667
Follow me

00:18:27.667 --> 00:18:29.083
Where are we going?

00:18:29.083 --> 00:18:31.959
If it’s going home, Jin’s not going

00:18:31.959 --> 00:18:34.918
Kanit understands the language, okay?

00:18:34.918 --> 00:18:37.083
Just follow me, hurry up

00:19:07.209 --> 00:19:09.626
Wow

00:19:09.626 --> 00:19:12.459
Kanit’s room looks so nice

00:19:12.459 --> 00:19:15.999
So neat and tidy

00:19:19.167 --> 00:19:21.584
Can you believe it? Someone like Kanit?"

00:19:21.584 --> 00:19:23.209
Wait, what do you mean by that?

00:19:23.209 --> 00:19:25.000
Are you saying I'm not neat?

00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:29.417
Come here, bring your bag

00:19:29.417 --> 00:19:30.667
Thanks

00:19:30.667 --> 00:19:33.417
Sigh, why do you carry so much stuff?

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:37.709
Come here

00:19:37.709 --> 00:19:41.417
Sit down

00:19:41.417 --> 00:19:44.626
Let’s sit and talk first

00:19:44.626 --> 00:19:47.620
You can stay here for now, Jin

00:19:47.959 --> 00:19:50.876
Thank you

00:19:51.542 --> 00:19:59.125
So... what are you thinking? Where will you stay after this?

00:19:59.125 --> 00:20:00.709
If I can’t find you a place,

00:20:00.709 --> 00:20:02.751
Jin will just sleep at the shop forever?

00:20:09.459 --> 00:20:12.792
If you have any problems, you can tell me

00:20:12.792 --> 00:20:14.584
Why don’t you want to go home?

00:20:23.876 --> 00:20:25.834
If you don’t want to talk about it yet, that’s okay

00:20:25.834 --> 00:20:28.250
I won’t push you

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:31.542
But if you need help, just let me know right away

00:20:31.542 --> 00:20:35.417
But please don’t do this again, okay?

00:20:35.417 --> 00:20:40.626
Okay

00:20:40.626 --> 00:20:43.709
So...

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:47.209
what about tomorrow?

00:20:47.209 --> 00:20:48.834
Where will you sleep?

00:20:48.834 --> 00:20:53.042
If you still don’t know, you can stay here for now

00:20:53.042 --> 00:20:55.292
Really?

00:20:55.292 --> 00:20:59.626
Kanit’s the nicest person in the world

00:20:59.626 --> 00:21:01.999
Alright, I’m heading out now

00:21:01.999 --> 00:21:05.876
You can take a shower or do whatever you want, okay?

00:21:05.876 --> 00:21:07.292
Thanks a lot

00:21:59.417 --> 00:22:02.542
You really sing so well

00:22:02.542 --> 00:22:08.209
I’m pretty sure you must be a singer

00:22:08.209 --> 00:22:10.542
Am I talking to a famous singer right now?

00:22:10.542 --> 00:22:12.292
Tell me the truth

00:22:12.292 --> 00:22:15.209
are you a singer?

00:22:15.209 --> 00:22:16.667
Nope

00:22:16.667 --> 00:22:20.918
Not a singer

00:22:20.918 --> 00:22:22.500
I don’t believe you

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.125
Are you scared it’ll get out in the news or something?

00:22:26.125 --> 00:22:28.999
Come on, just tell me

00:22:28.999 --> 00:22:32.626
I won’t send your pics to any celebrity gossip pages

00:22:32.626 --> 00:22:36.918
I’m really not

00:22:36.918 --> 00:22:41.959
Hmm, but I think you actually sing better

00:22:41.959 --> 00:22:45.292
than some singers

00:22:45.292 --> 00:22:47.083
Wow

00:22:47.083 --> 00:22:49.083
You’re flattering me too much

00:22:49.083 --> 00:22:51.042
I’m literally bouncing off the floor right now

00:22:51.042 --> 00:22:56.751
No exaggeration

00:22:56.751 --> 00:23:01.250
Actually, I do have a dream to be a singer

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:04.167
It’s a real dream

00:23:04.167 --> 00:23:05.250
Ohhh

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.125
So why not?

00:23:07.125 --> 00:23:10.209
Does your family not support you

00:23:10.209 --> 00:23:13.250
No, that’s not it

00:23:13.292 --> 00:23:14.626
Or...

00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:17.792
You just haven’t found the right path yet

00:23:17.792 --> 00:23:20.626
But nowadays it’s so open

00:23:20.626 --> 00:23:22.959
You can sing online

00:23:22.959 --> 00:23:26.125
or join singing contests and stuff

00:23:26.125 --> 00:23:28.375
There are so many options

00:23:28.375 --> 00:23:37.500
I think if you competed, you’d definitely get pretty far

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:42.876
Really? But I’m not a real singer

00:23:42.876 --> 00:23:47.292
Because I promised someone

00:23:47.292 --> 00:23:52.709
I have to focus on that first

00:23:56.334 --> 00:23:58.292
Well then

00:23:58.292 --> 00:24:03.417
whenever you want to sing again, you can sing for me

00:24:03.417 --> 00:24:08.334
I’m ready to listen every day

00:24:08.334 --> 00:24:12.250
Just don’t get tired of me, okay?

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.918
Never! I promise

00:25:28.167 --> 00:25:32.542
I wish that special someone would sing a love song to me like this

00:25:32.542 --> 00:25:35.584
I’d be so happy

00:25:35.584 --> 00:25:42.334
Well, you could just imagine your partner is singing it to you right now

00:25:42.334 --> 00:25:44.083
You think that works?

00:25:44.083 --> 00:25:45.667
Of course it does

00:25:45.667 --> 00:25:50.083
I bet you sing love songs to your partner all the time

00:25:50.083 --> 00:25:52.792
Never

00:25:52.792 --> 00:25:54.918
Why not?

00:25:54.918 --> 00:25:56.834
Hmm...

00:25:56.834 --> 00:25:59.417
Maybe she just doesn’t feel it like that

00:25:59.417 --> 00:26:01.334
Then...

00:26:01.334 --> 00:26:04.751
It’s okay

00:26:04.751 --> 00:26:07.042
Just

00:26:07.042 --> 00:26:09.584
pretend I’m your partner

00:26:09.584 --> 00:26:14.792
And sing to me as much as you want—until you feel satisfied

00:26:14.792 --> 00:26:18.250
As long as you don’t check out of the resort first

00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.584
Seriously?

00:26:20.584 --> 00:26:23.876
Mhm

00:26:38.334 --> 00:26:43.667
Dr. Lan...

00:26:44.584 --> 00:26:48.751
I just want to sing a love song to my partner, closer

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:05.042
Be my partner… just for a day

00:29:48.375 --> 00:29:52.250
Anything else you’d like to add, hmm?

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:54.542
Don’t tease me!

00:29:57.792 --> 00:29:58.918
Do you actually like her for real?

00:30:02.542 --> 00:30:07.375
If you like her, why don’t you just tell her directly?"

00:30:07.375 --> 00:30:11.250
When you like someone, you don’t always have to say it out loud

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.999
What we have right now… it already makes me happy

00:30:22.999 --> 00:30:25.167
Are you really happy though?

00:30:25.167 --> 00:30:29.999
Don’t let me catch you crying next to her, okay?

00:30:29.999 --> 00:30:32.042
You gotta pay attention too, you know

00:30:32.042 --> 00:30:35.751
See if she feels anything for you or not

00:30:35.751 --> 00:30:37.750
I’m a grown-up, okay!

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:42.375
I’m just saying. I don’t want to see my friend get hurt

00:30:42.375 --> 00:30:44.083
Thanks, Linlin

00:30:44.083 --> 00:30:46.918
You can go home first today

00:30:46.918 --> 00:30:49.500
Oh? Gonna go hang around her again, huh?

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:53.584
Nope. Just gonna walk around and do a little shopping

00:30:53.584 --> 00:30:54.918
Suureee

00:31:03.959 --> 00:31:05.459
You dressed up today, huh

00:31:05.459 --> 00:31:06.999
Going to work!

00:31:06.999 --> 00:31:11.125
Ohhh, going to work but make it fashion

00:31:11.125 --> 00:31:12.375
Wanna work together?

00:31:12.375 --> 00:31:13.334
Wanna go to work together?

00:31:13.334 --> 00:31:14.125
Nope

00:31:17.751 --> 00:31:21.083
Didn’t P’Lalin come with you guys?

00:31:21.083 --> 00:31:23.959
If she did, you’d have seen her, right?

00:31:23.959 --> 00:31:26.959
If you didn’t see her, then that means she’s not here

00:31:26.959 --> 00:31:31.500
Tuk Som, why are you answering her like that?

00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:34.000
Lalin went with Lan Why? Is something wrong?

00:31:34.792 --> 00:31:37.626
N-no, nothing

00:31:37.626 --> 00:31:39.167
Sooo…

00:31:39.167 --> 00:31:42.918
Sooo what? Are you like… a stalker or something?

00:31:42.918 --> 00:31:44.999
What? What’s a stalker?

00:31:44.999 --> 00:31:47.417
Tuk’s asking seriously — you don’t know?

00:31:47.417 --> 00:31:51.500
Nope. If I knew, would I be asking?

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.125
Ugh, fine. Gotta get to work. I’ll explain later

00:31:53.125 --> 00:31:54.959
Alright, okay

00:31:54.959 --> 00:31:55.792
I’m heading out now

00:31:55.792 --> 00:31:57.876
Bye-bye!

00:31:59.999 --> 00:32:02.876
I’m not some creepy stalker like they said, you know

00:32:04.792 --> 00:32:08.459
I never thought that about you

00:32:08.459 --> 00:32:11.999
So… is there something you wanted to say to Lalin?

00:32:11.999 --> 00:32:16.709
She left with Lan right after school

00:32:16.709 --> 00:32:18.834
Oof, twist the knife, why don’t you

00:32:22.999 --> 00:32:28.083
Anyway, if there’s nothing else, we’re heading off now

00:32:28.083 --> 00:32:30.626
Bye-bye

00:32:42.959 --> 00:32:45.250
Sometimes you’re kinda blunt, you know

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.876
Blunt? How?

00:32:46.876 --> 00:32:49.334
The way you answered that girl earlier

00:32:49.334 --> 00:32:51.792
You could’ve just said Lalin had something to do

00:32:51.792 --> 00:32:56.250
Come on, we’re students
what ‘something to do’ would that even be?

00:32:56.250 --> 00:33:01.042
I mean, it wouldn’t hurt to lie a little. I can tell she likes Lalin

00:33:01.042 --> 00:33:04.999
And the way you said it probably crushed her

00:33:04.999 --> 00:33:09.209
Well, I thought it’d be better for her to know the truth

00:33:09.209 --> 00:33:15.792
If she finds out now, it’ll hurt less in the long run,
She can move on faster, right?

00:33:15.792 --> 00:33:18.459
That’s fair

00:33:18.459 --> 00:33:21.292
Let’s walk around a bit before heading back

00:33:21.292 --> 00:33:22.876
Sure

00:33:34.626 --> 00:33:36.167
Done shopping already?

00:33:36.167 --> 00:33:38.417
Yeah

00:33:38.417 --> 00:33:40.876
Didn’t you say you were happy?

00:33:40.876 --> 00:33:42.500
Then why are you sitting here all by yourself like this?

00:33:45.292 --> 00:33:49.375
You’re probably just being real with yourself for once

00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:51.792
Falling for someone who’s already taken…

00:33:51.792 --> 00:33:55.918
it’s always gonna hurt

00:33:55.918 --> 00:33:58.000
I asked her already

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.876
They’re not officially together yet

00:33:59.876 --> 00:34:05.334
So what? Does she even like you back?

00:34:05.334 --> 00:34:07.250
And just because she said that, you believe her?

00:34:12.792 --> 00:34:14.667
Fine, whatever. It’s up to you

00:34:14.667 --> 00:34:17.792
No matter what I say, you’re not gonna listen anyway

00:34:17.792 --> 00:34:19.834
I’m leaving

00:34:19.834 --> 00:34:21.959
Gonna go shopping

00:34:30.584 --> 00:34:34.834
Even if you already have someone…

00:34:34.834 --> 00:34:38.792
I still like you

00:34:38.792 --> 00:34:41.167
I really, really like you

00:34:53.209 --> 00:34:54.667
When we’re doing business, right?

00:34:54.667 --> 00:34:58.209
We have to look at our strengths and weaknesses,

00:34:58.209 --> 00:35:00.709
and also our competitors.

00:35:00.709 --> 00:35:05.083
Usually we use a model called SWOT

00:35:05.083 --> 00:35:07.125
The 'S' stands for strength

00:35:13.709 --> 00:35:17.167
Right, and 'W' is for weakness

00:35:17.167 --> 00:35:21.209
‘O’ is opportunity

00:35:21.209 --> 00:35:26.375
And ‘T’ is threat

00:35:26.375 --> 00:35:29.167
Yep, very good

00:35:29.167 --> 00:35:35.876
Okay, let’s stop here for today. I’ll tutor you again tomorrow

00:35:35.876 --> 00:35:41.125
Thank you so much, P’Lalin

00:35:41.125 --> 00:35:43.709
About yesterday…

00:35:43.709 --> 00:35:48.250
Hmm? What about yesterday?

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:52.125
It’s nothing. I’ll go buy you some ice cream, okay?

00:35:52.125 --> 00:35:55.709
It’s alright, I actually have plans with a friend

00:35:55.709 --> 00:35:59.292
Let me treat you just once to say thank you, please

00:36:07.125 --> 00:36:08.334
Hmm… okay

00:36:08.334 --> 00:36:12.417
And look at this!

00:36:16.292 --> 00:36:19.751
Whoa, Kanit’s only helping Jin again.

00:36:19.751 --> 00:36:21.709
Som and I don’t know how to do it either!

00:36:21.709 --> 00:36:26.209
Yeah! We have to turn it in to the professor too, you know

00:36:26.209 --> 00:36:29.209
Well, I’ll help you guys after I finish helping Jin, okay?

00:36:29.209 --> 00:36:34.083
Wow, Jin always comes first, huh?

00:36:34.083 --> 00:36:37.751
Seriously, you two…

00:36:37.751 --> 00:36:41.209
Are you guys dating or what?

00:36:43.792 --> 00:36:47.292
Come on, Som! What are you saying!

00:36:47.292 --> 00:36:49.292
We’re not dating!

00:36:49.292 --> 00:36:52.042
Then why are you so flustered?

00:36:52.042 --> 00:36:55.792
I was just teasing~

00:36:55.792 --> 00:36:58.167
Alright, alright

00:37:00.918 --> 00:37:04.083
Tuk, Som

00:37:04.083 --> 00:37:07.500
have you finished your assignment yet?

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.626
Not yet, P’Lalin

00:37:10.626 --> 00:37:12.918
Yeah! Kanit’s been busy helping Jin

00:37:12.918 --> 00:37:15.042
so we haven’t made any progress!

00:37:15.042 --> 00:37:17.626
Exactly!

00:37:17.626 --> 00:37:19.125
See?

00:37:19.125 --> 00:37:22.000
Told yoo if you’re gonna have a part-time job,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.834
you have to keep up with school too

00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:30.250
Sorryyy

00:37:45.667 --> 00:37:54.209
Kanittt, can you help me too? I seriously don’t get it

00:37:54.209 --> 00:37:57.125
It’s just a summary

00:37:57.125 --> 00:37:59.375
Can you teach me at least?

00:37:59.375 --> 00:38:03.500
Teach, yes. Do it for you? No

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:05.626
Ughhh!

00:38:05.626 --> 00:38:07.620
Fine, You have to do it by yourtselves then!

00:38:07.620 --> 00:38:09.584
It’s just a tiny bit

00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:15.292
Write it

00:38:17.542 --> 00:38:21.459
Have you guys seen P’Lalin?

00:38:21.459 --> 00:38:24.375
Did you buy ice cream for her?

00:38:24.375 --> 00:38:28.459
Did you get any for us by any chance?

00:38:32.417 --> 00:38:36.125
Lalin’s outside on the phone

00:38:39.999 --> 00:38:43.167
Thanks!

00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.751
Okay, Dad. Talk to you later—bye!

00:40:13.042 --> 00:40:15.375
What is she even doing?

00:40:15.375 --> 00:40:18.375
That's right, I just ate it myself.

00:40:18.375 --> 00:40:20.375
Then tell her to buy it for you, Lalin.

00:40:29.167 --> 00:40:31.834
Now you mouth’s all messy

00:40:52.417 --> 00:40:54.834
I’ll go buy a new one, promise!

00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:06.209
Still... kinda cute though

00:41:06.209 --> 00:41:09.000
Are you talking about me?

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.459
I meant outside!

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:19.292
Ahaaa, you two are acting sus again!

00:41:19.292 --> 00:41:22.042
It's kinda weird

00:41:22.042 --> 00:41:24.959
What?

00:41:24.959 --> 00:41:30.751
You’re blushing! Teasing, teasing!

00:41:30.751 --> 00:41:36.292
Kanit, don’t help Som anymore she’s been annoying lately!

00:41:39.417 --> 00:41:43.000
"How do you do this part? Tuk wants to see too!

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.459
Just kidding

00:41:47.167 --> 00:41:51.209
Can I walk you home, P’Lalin

00:41:51.209 --> 00:41:53.667
That’s okay. I’ve got something to do

00:41:56.292 --> 00:41:58.667
Alright, I’ll head to class then!

00:42:02.083 --> 00:42:04.834
Let’s go to class

00:42:07.792 --> 00:42:10.709
Wow, mood switch much

00:42:17.125 --> 00:42:19.751
What did you say to her just now?

00:42:19.751 --> 00:42:21.167
She looked upset walking away

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.834
Nothing really… we didn’t talk about anything

00:42:24.876 --> 00:42:27.375
It’s nothing. Let’s just go to class

00:42:47.083 --> 00:42:48.834
I’m not giving up that easily, you know

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:52.834
How are your symptoms?

00:42:52.834 --> 00:42:55.792
Go see a doctor and talk to yourself.

00:42:55.792 --> 00:42:58.083
I wasn’t talking to myself

00:42:58.083 --> 00:42:59.500
Just sitting here, that’s all

00:43:07.125 --> 00:43:10.999
Lying’s a sin, you know

00:43:10.999 --> 00:43:13.334
I’m not lying

00:43:13.334 --> 00:43:14.876
Then what’s going on

00:43:14.876 --> 00:43:17.999
It’s nothing. I just came to walk you to class

00:43:17.999 --> 00:43:20.626
You can do whatever you want…

00:43:20.626 --> 00:43:24.209
but don’t forget to love yourself too

00:43:24.209 --> 00:43:25.000
Let's go to school

00:43:30.751 --> 00:43:33.334
Go! Go to school now!

00:44:02.334 --> 00:44:05.209
Hey Kanit!

00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:11.083
I hope this sweetness makes you feel as bright as you make me feel

00:44:11.083 --> 00:44:15.083
Wowww

00:44:15.083 --> 00:44:17.125
So sweet

00:44:17.125 --> 00:44:19.459
Lan is very romantic

00:44:19.459 --> 00:44:22.083
Kanitt, you’re such a smooth talker!

00:44:25.167 --> 00:44:27.709
Looks delicious.

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:13.125
Did she make you wait again?

00:45:13.125 --> 00:45:15.250
I'm the one waiting for her.

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:21.459
Sorry if I'm interfering in your personal matters again.

00:45:21.459 --> 00:45:24.125
It's okay

00:45:24.125 --> 00:45:26.792
Don't tell me that you also waitign for your friend again

00:45:26.792 --> 00:45:28.792
nothing

00:45:28.792 --> 00:45:32.042
I’ve seen you like to hang out and wait right here a lot

00:45:32.042 --> 00:45:36.459
So

00:45:36.459 --> 00:45:39.626
Come sit and wait with you

00:45:39.626 --> 00:45:46.834
I can stay alone comfortably.

00:45:46.834 --> 00:45:49.626
You’re actually one tough person

00:45:49.626 --> 00:45:51.834
If it were me, I would cry and have a runny nose.

00:45:51.834 --> 00:45:54.125
I ran back home already.

00:45:55.417 --> 00:45:57.626
It's just some things.

00:45:57.626 --> 00:46:00.584
But sometimes I'm also sensitive person

00:46:03.792 --> 00:46:07.999
So when will you let me treat you to a meal?

00:46:07.999 --> 00:46:10.792
I've been waiting for several days now.

00:46:10.792 --> 00:46:13.417
I'm not free yet

00:46:13.417 --> 00:46:16.667
Let's go back

00:46:16.667 --> 00:46:19.667
I would like to walk with you

00:46:47.417 --> 00:46:48.209
Excuse me for a moment.

00:46:52.834 --> 00:46:55.876
Ah, Jin, I’ll head into the shop first, okay?

00:46:55.876 --> 00:46:57.542
Okay, okay.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.250
What? How Tell me.

00:47:08.292 --> 00:47:11.209
I'll go take a shower first and then tell you.

00:47:36.209 --> 00:47:39.999
Uh, Khun Lalin...

00:47:41.709 --> 00:47:45.500
And Khun Kanit?

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.918
Oh, I’ll go get Jin for you.

00:48:32.334 --> 00:48:34.667
Whoa, Lalin! How could you?

00:48:35.999 --> 00:48:38.334
Don’t be so loud!

00:48:38.334 --> 00:48:44.459
Afraid they won’t hear? Now everyone’s going to hear!

00:48:45.959 --> 00:48:47.167
Lalinnn...

00:48:48.542 --> 00:48:51.626
I don’t get what’s going on with Dr. Lan.

00:48:52.584 --> 00:48:57.709
Please let Jin know, that’s all I know.

00:48:57.709 --> 00:49:00.292
Okay??

00:49:00.292 --> 00:49:02.959
But

00:49:03.584 --> 00:49:09.167
my sister would like to withdraw an advance of 5,000 baht

00:49:09.167 --> 00:49:10.709
Please pay in cash. No transfers.

00:49:10.709 --> 00:49:14.000
Hey, it's getting too much.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.417
Do you know that if you talk like that, not only will you not get paid?

00:49:16.417 --> 00:49:18.250
Jin won't get the job either.

00:49:18.250 --> 00:49:20.375
So what?

00:49:20.375 --> 00:49:23.125
Find me 5000. I'll hurry up and go.

00:49:23.125 --> 00:49:25.584
I don't really want to be here, a place like this.
