1
00:00:09,848 --> 00:00:13,618
SERIAL MYSTERIOUS DEATHS

2
00:00:21,693 --> 00:00:23,495
The year is almost over.

3
00:00:24,262 --> 00:00:26,931
Time has flown by
since I was transferred in April.

4
00:00:28,867 --> 00:00:31,302
You must hate me because it's my fault

5
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:34,906
that you had to transfer.

6
00:00:34,973 --> 00:00:36,875
What? Why?

7
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:38,143
I don't hate you.

8
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:40,912
People get transferred all the time.

9
00:00:41,412 --> 00:00:45,016
But I never imagined
I'd be placed on the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i>,

10
00:00:45,617 --> 00:00:49,621
working on such a big story
like the mysterious deaths case.

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,129
I have to go to a meeting now.

12
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,933
Good luck editing the novel!

13
00:01:06,704 --> 00:01:07,539
Huh?

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,208
Ms. Shinoda.

15
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:17,749
Mr. Aoshiro?

16
00:01:17,815 --> 00:01:19,017
Why are you here?

17
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,355
Do you think that I did this?

18
00:01:24,422 --> 00:01:26,925
No, I'm not sure yet.

19
00:01:26,991 --> 00:01:30,728
I was overseas
when the second death occurred.

20
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:32,497
I have an alibi.

21
00:01:33,598 --> 00:01:39,537
Besides, why would someone
who's all clean have to kill anyone?

22
00:01:40,171 --> 00:01:43,775
But you did some questionable things
behind the scenes back in the day.

23
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:49,347
You mean this?

24
00:01:51,683 --> 00:01:53,818
<i>Just between us,</i>

25
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:57,956
<i>everyone who got in his way</i>
<i>met a tragic fate.</i>

26
00:01:58,022 --> 00:01:59,657
Give that back! It belongs to--

27
00:01:59,724 --> 00:02:00,858
Tell me, Ms. Shinoda.

28
00:02:03,294 --> 00:02:04,195
You'll trust me,

29
00:02:07,131 --> 00:02:08,533
won't you?

30
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:11,836
Mr. Aoshiro.

31
00:02:16,674 --> 00:02:17,508
Hey, you.

32
00:02:20,912 --> 00:02:21,779
Kubozuka?

33
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,916
Are you the one saying that I did this?

34
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:26,818
No, I'm not!

35
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:29,721
The police put you on a wanted list!

36
00:02:29,787 --> 00:02:33,891
But in your hometown of Niigata,
people said you were a good guy.

37
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:37,328
I'm just trying to find out the truth!

38
00:02:38,696 --> 00:02:40,531
Which is the real you?

39
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:45,470
Please say something!

40
00:02:47,138 --> 00:02:48,773
Then let me ask you.

41
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:57,849
I haven't seen you since the mixer.

42
00:02:58,583 --> 00:03:01,886
So you're Harue Komiyama's nephew.

43
00:03:01,953 --> 00:03:03,488
Atsuhiro Imamura.

44
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,628
You're saying I'm guilty?

45
00:03:11,296 --> 00:03:15,833
There's testimony that Ms. Komiyama
met with Kubozuka before her death.

46
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:22,240
But was the person you met
really Harue Komiyama?

47
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:24,742
What are you saying?

48
00:03:25,376 --> 00:03:28,913
I heard you had a shady hobby.

49
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,784
Could it be crossdressing?

50
00:03:34,986 --> 00:03:38,823
If so, then perhaps you were the one
Kubozuka met at the cave bar,

51
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,059
after which you killed Ms. Komiyama

52
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,228
and framed it on Kubozuka?

53
00:03:45,063 --> 00:03:48,833
You're just a tabloid reporter,
not the police. What are you doing?

54
00:03:57,875 --> 00:04:01,479
How about you drop out
of this investigation already?

55
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:05,650
Is this job worth risking your life for?

56
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:08,986
Stay out of it.

57
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:11,622
Just leave it to the police.

58
00:04:21,966 --> 00:04:22,834
No!

59
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,136
There's a role for tabloids to play!

60
00:04:40,017 --> 00:04:42,954
I've decided to bring the missing
Madoka Hashimoto

61
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,757
back to this bear and her mother.

62
00:04:45,823 --> 00:04:48,359
Where is Madoka now?

63
00:04:49,827 --> 00:04:50,962
Stay away!

64
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:54,665
Huh?

65
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:12,250
It opened?

66
00:05:13,518 --> 00:05:15,253
Help me!

67
00:05:16,988 --> 00:05:18,656
Is anyone here?

68
00:05:26,097 --> 00:05:28,866
DANGER! BEWARE OF BEARS

69
00:05:34,605 --> 00:05:36,073
The <i>Truth Weekly</i>?

70
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:44,015
What?

71
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:48,553
<i>SENGOKU WEEKLY</i> INCIDENT TEAM ATTACKED!

72
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:57,228
A GRUDGE AGAINST TABLOIDS!

73
00:06:04,235 --> 00:06:05,336
Mr. Kitahama?

74
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,505
Are you okay?

75
00:06:08,372 --> 00:06:10,341
It's all over for tabloids!

76
00:06:11,676 --> 00:06:13,945
It's not worth risking your life for.

77
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,385
<i>Sengoku Weekly</i> is hereby discontinued!

78
00:06:22,753 --> 00:06:24,989
It's what the world wants.

79
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,924
What about the case?

80
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:29,694
Leave it to the police!

81
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,297
What about the hidden truth
the police can't act on?

82
00:06:33,364 --> 00:06:35,900
Are we just going to ignore it?

83
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:37,201
We have novels!

84
00:06:37,935 --> 00:06:41,205
We can make our mark through stories.

85
00:06:41,272 --> 00:06:43,274
It's much slower than tabloids.

86
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:44,208
In that case.

87
00:06:45,843 --> 00:06:47,345
There's social media!

88
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:52,049
People with a strong sense of justice
will expose the world's darkness.

89
00:06:52,116 --> 00:06:55,186
What if they make those posts
without investigating?

90
00:06:55,253 --> 00:06:57,488
-Everyone would believe them!
-Then!

91
00:06:58,489 --> 00:07:00,258
You decide as the lone survivor.

92
00:07:01,359 --> 00:07:04,795
Think hard about what you're going to do.

93
00:07:05,429 --> 00:07:06,264
Listen.

94
00:07:07,231 --> 00:07:09,934
There are three important things.

95
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:14,639
Mr. Kitahama?

96
00:07:15,473 --> 00:07:16,741
Mr. Kitahama!

97
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:17,808
Mr. Kitahama!

98
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:19,544
You can't do that!

99
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,013
At least tell me one of them!

100
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,348
What should I do?

101
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,883
Mr. Kitahama!

102
00:07:26,517 --> 00:07:28,486
Mr. Kitahama!

103
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:31,389
Mr. Kitahama!

104
00:07:36,794 --> 00:07:39,697
ATSUHIRO IMAMURA

105
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:43,534
Mr. Kitahama?

106
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,841
-Hi everyone.
-We're back.

107
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:53,177
Good news, you two.

108
00:07:53,244 --> 00:07:54,078
How'd it go?

109
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,181
Jackpot.

110
00:07:57,248 --> 00:07:59,650
We found the crossdressers' bar
Imamura went to.

111
00:07:59,717 --> 00:08:01,118
Here he is, dressed as a woman.

112
00:08:35,152 --> 00:08:39,390
<i>There's a possibility that</i>
<i>the wanted fugitive Kota Kubozuka</i>

113
00:08:39,457 --> 00:08:42,560
was framed
for the serial mysterious deaths.

114
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:45,529
But there's no definitive proof yet.

115
00:08:45,596 --> 00:08:48,966
We have to find some evidence
by Tuesday night

116
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:50,668
to make it for the next issue.

117
00:08:51,369 --> 00:08:56,040
Or else the <i>Truth Weekly</i> will run
their story on Aoshiro and beat us.

118
00:08:56,674 --> 00:08:57,742
Three more days.

119
00:09:02,246 --> 00:09:03,214
I have a call.

120
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,016
-You can answer.
-Sorry.

121
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:07,785
Hello?

122
00:09:08,486 --> 00:09:11,088
<i>Hello, Hinako Shinoda?</i>

123
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:14,291
<i>It's Yanagishita from Niigata.</i>

124
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:16,093
Niigata?

125
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:22,533
Ms. Yanagishita!

126
00:09:23,334 --> 00:09:25,302
It's good to hear from you.

127
00:09:25,803 --> 00:09:27,204
How are you?

128
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:32,977
Remember how you left us money
and a polite hand-written letter?

129
00:09:33,044 --> 00:09:35,446
<i>You didn't need to do that.</i>

130
00:09:35,513 --> 00:09:38,249
Please, you did so much for me.

131
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:41,952
Are you still working for that tabloid?

132
00:09:42,586 --> 00:09:43,454
I am!

133
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:48,092
<i>Then I have a favor to ask.</i>

134
00:09:49,126 --> 00:09:51,762
<i>You came to visit</i>
<i>Mr. Watanabe's home, right?</i>

135
00:09:52,496 --> 00:09:53,364
Yes.

136
00:09:53,431 --> 00:09:58,102
When I told Mr. Watanabe about you,
he was surprised at first,

137
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:00,371
but then I just got a call.

138
00:10:00,871 --> 00:10:04,341
<i>He said he wanted to talk</i>
<i>to a </i>Sengoku Weekly<i> reporter.</i>

139
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:11,549
<i>He said he wants to</i>
<i>meet with you directly.</i>

140
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:16,454
So would you mind giving him a call
if I give you his number?

141
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,925
I'm sorry, could you hold for one second?

142
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:25,229
It's the woman I met in Niigata.

143
00:10:25,296 --> 00:10:30,301
Apparently, Kubozuka's guardian,
Mr. Watanabe wants to talk.

144
00:10:31,168 --> 00:10:32,636
Is it okay to get his number?

145
00:10:33,471 --> 00:10:34,305
-Do it!
-Of course!

146
00:10:36,974 --> 00:10:38,342
Thank you for waiting.

147
00:10:39,143 --> 00:10:41,045
I'd love to talk to him.

148
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:44,682
<i>Really? That's great!</i>

149
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,952
<i>I'll let Mr. Watanabe know.</i>

150
00:10:48,018 --> 00:10:48,919
Okay.

151
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:51,422
<i>Do you have something to write with?</i>

152
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:52,323
One second.

153
00:11:04,502 --> 00:11:05,569
Go ahead.

154
00:11:22,486 --> 00:11:25,990
I'm the guardian who took Kota Kubozuka in

155
00:11:26,056 --> 00:11:29,660
after he was put on house arrest
for assault.

156
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:31,929
Yes, we are aware.

157
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:35,733
First, I'd like to know

158
00:11:37,668 --> 00:11:42,139
if the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i> would immediately
let the police in on it

159
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,209
if they're contacted by a fugitive?

160
00:11:47,244 --> 00:11:48,078
Huh?

161
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:51,949
Normally, you would, right?
To inform them.

162
00:11:52,016 --> 00:11:53,584
Most people would think that.

163
00:11:54,218 --> 00:11:59,657
But would the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i> prioritize
the story over helping the police?

164
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:05,429
-Um--
-We do.

165
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:09,266
We have our priorities.

166
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,267
Mr. Kitahama!

167
00:12:10,935 --> 00:12:15,639
We would prioritize the story
over reporting anything to the police.

168
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:20,344
I see.

169
00:12:24,582 --> 00:12:27,218
If you promise not to report it
right away,

170
00:12:27,284 --> 00:12:28,485
I have a proposal.

171
00:12:29,286 --> 00:12:30,287
You have my word.

172
00:12:30,888 --> 00:12:31,722
What is it?

173
00:12:34,558 --> 00:12:38,262
Kota Kubozuka says he's been framed.

174
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:45,703
But he's a wanted fugitive.

175
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:49,874
He thinks if he's caught by the police
now, they'll surely pin it on him.

176
00:12:51,008 --> 00:12:52,610
I know him well.

177
00:12:53,444 --> 00:12:54,979
He's a good guy.

178
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:57,081
He might lose his temper and get violent,

179
00:12:57,147 --> 00:12:59,283
but he's not the type of guy
to kill someone.

180
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:02,353
So you're in contact with Mr. Kubozuka.

181
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:04,521
Yes. Just over the phone.

182
00:13:05,823 --> 00:13:09,760
He was surprised when I told him
a tabloid came looking for me.

183
00:13:10,895 --> 00:13:14,632
Maybe he remembered that,
because I got a call yesterday.

184
00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:15,766
What did he say?

185
00:13:17,334 --> 00:13:21,538
He asked if the <i>Sengoku Weekly</i>
would listen to his side of the story.

186
00:13:29,013 --> 00:13:29,914
Of course.

187
00:13:30,547 --> 00:13:32,549
We'd be honored to handle it.

188
00:13:33,617 --> 00:13:36,120
All the more if he's innocent.

189
00:13:37,755 --> 00:13:38,756
Really?

190
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,692
You won't be arrested for it?

191
00:13:43,827 --> 00:13:45,863
You won't back out for sales?

192
00:13:46,964 --> 00:13:48,098
It's okay, right?

193
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:50,601
Don't worry.

194
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,705
Please leave it to us!

195
00:14:02,479 --> 00:14:04,682
What time and place?

196
00:14:04,748 --> 00:14:06,450
We're flexible.

197
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:10,854
If he wants somewhere private,
we have a reception room at the office.

198
00:14:10,921 --> 00:14:12,790
We could use that.

199
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,326
I'll send in Kubozuka alone.

200
00:14:15,392 --> 00:14:16,226
Okay.

201
00:14:16,293 --> 00:14:17,661
We'll pick him up by car.

202
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:20,931
Thank you very much.

203
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,634
-Thank you.
-Of course.

204
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:27,004
Thank you.

205
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:28,572
Of course!

206
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:34,278
We got a big one!

207
00:14:34,345 --> 00:14:35,946
-Nice work.
-Thank you both, too.

208
00:14:36,013 --> 00:14:38,048
You sure about dropping Aoshiro's tail?

209
00:14:38,115 --> 00:14:40,084
We got a bigger tip.

210
00:14:42,252 --> 00:14:43,654
You okay, Shinoda?

211
00:14:44,254 --> 00:14:47,024
I'm all out of gas after this.

212
00:14:47,091 --> 00:14:49,126
You were really fired up.

213
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,628
-We're back.
-Okay.

214
00:14:51,695 --> 00:14:53,430
-Good work.
-Good work.

215
00:14:53,497 --> 00:14:55,466
How how did it go with the guardian?

216
00:14:55,532 --> 00:14:57,735
Okay, we're all here.

217
00:14:57,801 --> 00:14:58,736
Listen up.

218
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:00,404
Don't be shocked.

219
00:15:01,105 --> 00:15:03,774
The <i>Sengoku Weekly</i>'s story for next issue

220
00:15:04,475 --> 00:15:07,845
is an exclusive interview
with a wanted fugitive!

221
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:10,180
-Wow!
-For real?

222
00:15:10,247 --> 00:15:11,115
Great job.

223
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,717
How about you?

224
00:15:14,284 --> 00:15:19,590
We talked to a witness who saw someone
resembling Kubozuka.

225
00:15:19,656 --> 00:15:23,527
He said the man was shopping at
a convenience store with a young girl.

226
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:24,995
A young girl?

227
00:15:25,596 --> 00:15:27,965
MADOKA HASHIMOTO

228
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,834
I had the same thought.

229
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:34,138
I asked the clerk to call me
if they see them again.

230
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:37,374
That means Madoka Hashimoto
is alive, right?

231
00:15:37,441 --> 00:15:38,475
I hope so.

232
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:42,079
Okay, okay!

233
00:15:42,146 --> 00:15:43,113
In any case,

234
00:15:44,248 --> 00:15:45,282
let's eat!

235
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,952
Shinoda, Akutsu, could you go
on a food run and get some meals?

236
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:50,320
-Really?
-Okay.

237
00:15:50,921 --> 00:15:52,122
Thank you, sir!

238
00:15:54,124 --> 00:15:55,192
One more?

239
00:15:57,161 --> 00:15:58,028
Thank you!

240
00:15:58,095 --> 00:15:59,696
-We'll be back!
-Later!

241
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:01,632
-How much?
-Just 15,000 yen!

242
00:16:01,698 --> 00:16:03,467
Seems like too much.

243
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:12,476
You went to meet Madoka's mother, right?

244
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,079
-Yeah.
-You know what I think?

245
00:16:15,712 --> 00:16:19,416
That visit gave her a reason
to call her daughter.

246
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:22,920
Kubozuka is claiming to be innocent,

247
00:16:22,986 --> 00:16:26,156
and Madoka is staying with him
because she believes him.

248
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:28,892
I think her mother knew about it.

249
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:34,965
I don't know what happened between mom
and daughter, but I guess they'd call.

250
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:37,868
But he's a wanted fugitive.

251
00:16:37,935 --> 00:16:43,273
She's worried something bad would happen
if she reported them.

252
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,976
She probably didn't know what to do.

253
00:16:47,111 --> 00:16:50,747
And just at that point,
a tabloid reporter showed up.

254
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:56,687
She probably never considered that anyone
would choose not to report it.

255
00:16:57,488 --> 00:16:59,790
Mr. Watanabe said the same.

256
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:02,759
This is going to sound conceited, but…

257
00:17:03,494 --> 00:17:06,396
a tabloid like us made a breakthrough.

258
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:13,971
It made me feel like we did something
useful for the first time.

259
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:20,077
I was having serious second thoughts
when we were staking out the cemetery.

260
00:17:21,478 --> 00:17:22,613
You too?

261
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:23,780
I felt the same.

262
00:17:23,847 --> 00:17:25,449
Yeah? I mean, you would right?

263
00:17:25,516 --> 00:17:26,450
Totally.

264
00:17:27,784 --> 00:17:28,919
Like the Philippines?

265
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,888
Okay, go with that.

266
00:17:30,954 --> 00:17:31,989
We're back.

267
00:17:32,756 --> 00:17:33,790
-Nice.
-We got it.

268
00:17:33,857 --> 00:17:34,691
Thanks.

269
00:17:34,758 --> 00:17:36,059
What are you doing?

270
00:17:37,494 --> 00:17:40,964
The <i>Sengoku Weekly</i> will be
launching a camouflage tactic.

271
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:43,033
What's that?

272
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,069
We're setting up a dummy trail
so the <i>Truth Weekly</i>

273
00:17:46,136 --> 00:17:48,639
doesn't find out about our interview
with Kubozuka.

274
00:17:48,705 --> 00:17:49,540
A dummy?

275
00:17:49,606 --> 00:17:54,077
If they sense us backing off of Aoshiro,
they'll suspect we have something bigger.

276
00:17:54,778 --> 00:17:57,314
So we thought it's better to mislead them.

277
00:17:57,881 --> 00:18:01,485
Like "Kota Kubozuka Escapes Overseas"
or something.

278
00:18:01,552 --> 00:18:04,488
We're coordinating with locals
to make them believe

279
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:06,390
Kubozuka has fled overseas.

280
00:18:06,957 --> 00:18:08,492
That's great teamwork.

281
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,062
The question is, who do we say
went overseas?

282
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:14,631
Someone will have to come
to work in disguise.

283
00:18:14,698 --> 00:18:16,967
Who's good at lying low?

284
00:18:27,511 --> 00:18:28,912
Go have some fun overseas!

285
00:18:28,979 --> 00:18:30,214
You leave tomorrow!

286
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,848
You mean, I'm just pretending, right?

287
00:18:31,915 --> 00:18:33,584
-But be in disguise.
-Really?

288
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,386
-Don't get caught by the <i>Truth</i>.
-I'll try not to.

289
00:18:36,453 --> 00:18:38,055
Your disguise will be comped.

290
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:40,090
Seriously?

291
00:18:40,157 --> 00:18:42,226
-They sell curly wigs at Donki.
-Stop making fun of me.

292
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:43,260
Is this revenge?

293
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,095
Come on, let's eat!

294
00:18:45,162 --> 00:18:46,563
-Yes, let's!
-Hold on.

295
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,698
Is this decided?

296
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:50,400
Is it decided?

297
00:18:52,102 --> 00:18:53,136
I don't want to!

298
00:18:57,341 --> 00:19:00,777
<i>The big interview would already come</i>
<i>the following day.</i>

299
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,012
TO BE CONTINUED

300
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:37,714
Please tell us everything you know.

301
00:19:37,781 --> 00:19:40,550
<i>Next thing I knew,</i>
<i>I was a wanted fugitive.</i>

302
00:19:40,617 --> 00:19:42,753
Mom, I…

303
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,455
<i>If that's what you decided,</i>
<i>you have my support.</i>

304
00:19:45,522 --> 00:19:47,591
Mr. Kitahama, breaking news!

305
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:49,526
Okay!
