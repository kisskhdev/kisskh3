=Episode 8=

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.079
What's that sound?

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.280
Someone is here.

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:51.719
Check here.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.200
Outside...

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:53.439
No one here.

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:54.840
No one here either.

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:58.439
Boss, does K really live here?

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.200
(They found this place so quickly.)

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.399
If he hadn't gone
to the hospital for that woman,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.879
I wouldn't have found him.

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:07.560
Boss, no one is inside

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.680
and outside either.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:10.319
Impossible.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.400
They're still hiding here.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.400
Tear the place apart if you have to.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.159
Search again.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:18.480
Understood.

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:19.719
Take this chip.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.959
Don't come out no matter what happens.

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:34.359
Don't worry.

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:36.120
I'll be fine.

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:05.480
Give me the chip.

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:07.319
Or I'll kill you.

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:09.960
If you kill me,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.360
you'll never get the chip back.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.039
If you don't hand it over now,

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:16.400
you'll die.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.840
Stop!

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:24.560
It's you.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.240
Isn't this what you want?

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.680
Let us go.

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:32.520
You can have it.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:33.080
Gu Nian.

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:40.840
Give me the chip. Now!

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.039
Look for it on your hands and knees.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.360
Where are they?

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.039
Are you okay?

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.719
Your wound reopened.

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:00.919
I'm fine.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.680
Where's the chip?

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:07.400
Is it that important?

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.199
You're risking your life.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.800
It is.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.439
It's more important than my life.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.680
We won't escape together.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.080
Follow this path to get out.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.879
Go now.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.560
I'll get help to save you.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:39.639
K, you're the mole.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.840
I'll chop off your hands and feet.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.800
You've been exposed.

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:45.919
We have to abandon you.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.080
Don't leave me.

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.080
You betrayed me.

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:52.280
Just die.

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:08.000
You're awake.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.800
You're running a fever.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.120
Didn't I tell you to leave?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.360
Why did you come back?

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.800
Stop.

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:35.199
Trying to leave now.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.959
Isn't it too late?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.800
I'm a drug dealer.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.160
Why did you save me?

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:46.240
Answer me.

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:49.920
Because I'm a doctor.

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:51.360
You're lying.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.639
I'm not.

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:53.639

not to develop any feelings for me?

Where's the chip?

I don't know.

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:08.839

K.

You're the first person to make me

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.240

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.040
You want to know?

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.839
Go ask him.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.519
Hand over the chip.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.680

I thought she'd be different for you.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.639
Fine, I'll push her then.

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:32.159
I'll count to three.
