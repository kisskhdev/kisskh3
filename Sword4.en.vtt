=Episode 4=

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.355
Why would you give her those pills
if she's your girlfriend?

00:01:39.377 --> 00:01:40.220
Well, as a guy,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.220
of course, I wanted my girlfriend

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.140
to be a little...

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:47.660
More developed

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.860
after taking them.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.020
Men care about pride.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.900
Look,

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:51.780
I...

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.180
I admit giving her

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.860
the pills

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.740
was wrong.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.740
I admit my mistake.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.420
I'll take responsibility and accept
whatever legal punishment comes my way.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.140
This guy is too slick.

00:02:14.666 --> 00:02:15.780
Without solid evidence,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.700
he won't say anything.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.540
So, what do we do now?

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.380
Talk to Zhou Min.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.620
I already told you

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.780
her mother won't agree.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.820
Her mother doesn't agree.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.600
Then we'll step in
and do her mother's job.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:28.500
Then...

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.460
Hold on a second.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.460
We can't continue
to waste time like this.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.180
Hello.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.780
Got it.

00:02:37.733 --> 00:02:38.580
Zhou Min is here.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.866
She has agreed to meet us.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.380
Min,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.620
your mother

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.220
and a few of us are here with you.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.020
If you ever feel uncomfortable

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.340
or wish to stop at any point,

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.340
that's perfectly okay.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.700
I want to speak.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.900
I can't let that man hurt anyone else.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.020
I met him on my way home from school.

00:03:10.111 --> 00:03:11.380
He asked me for directions,

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.711
so I showed him the way.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.980
After that, I blacked out.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.460
When I woke up,

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.060
I was in a small room.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.700
There was a man

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.460
in a white coat nearby.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.700
I remembered what some classmates said

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.100
about bad people
who abduct others to harvest organs.

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.900
I was terrified

00:03:42.022 --> 00:03:43.444
and tried to fight back.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.340
Then...

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.940
Then he took off my pants.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.540
Min, take a look at this photo.
Is this the man in the white coat?

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:12.500
Yes,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.900
that's him.

00:04:21.777 --> 00:04:23.020
You're doing fine.

00:04:28.866 --> 00:04:30.060
Are you okay to continue?

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:33.620
Then

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.460
he covered my face with a cloth.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.660
After that, I lost consciousness.

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.180
When I woke up again,

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.980
my eyes were covered.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.100
I could only hear voices.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.100
The man

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.740
who took me

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.140
was talking to someone else.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.220
That man sounded very angry.

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.140
The one who took me

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.500
kept apologizing
and saying he made a mistake.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.940
There was music playing the entire time,

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.180
so I couldn't hear clearly.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.100
Do you remember

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:11.740
what kind of music it was?

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.020
It sounded

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.340
like club music.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.340
Officers,

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.600
I've already told you everything

00:05:28.688 --> 00:05:29.900
I know.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.100
That's all there is.

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.540
You say

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.100
you were dating Zhou Min.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.980
What kind of date involves taking her

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.422
to an unlicensed doctor
for a so-called "goods inspection"

00:05:39.622 --> 00:05:41.222
and sending her to a nightclub?

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.660
No, no.

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.300
That's not true.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.180
That never happened.

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:46.900
Hu Xifan,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.660
the unlicensed doctor,

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.460
had already confessed.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.380
So did your buddy Zhao Liang.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.020
He told us everything.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.660
You're the only one left.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.980
If you stay silent now,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.300
you'll take the fall for all of it.

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.940
All right.

00:06:05.555 --> 00:06:07.660
With combined sentencing
for multiple offenses,

00:06:07.755 --> 00:06:08.820
it'd be around 20 years.

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:11.340
Can you handle that?

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:14.620
Wait.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:16.820
I admit it.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:17.380
I only...

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.900
I only

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.460
want to be with her,

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.140
but sometimes she can be stubborn.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.340
And I wasn't thinking clearly.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.260
I was young

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.860
and lost it.

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:26.700
At one point,

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.220
I even thought about selling her.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.300
Officer Chang, you already know.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.500
I was planning to sell her to you,

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.733
but I didn't have a handler.

00:06:38.444 --> 00:06:39.644
What did you just say?

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.980
No handler?

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.340
Did we ask you about that?

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:45.380
No, no.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.711
I got emotional just now.

00:06:48.733 --> 00:06:50.060
I said the wrong thing.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.940
When you were with Zhao Dafeng,

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:53.860
you mentioned your boss.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.533
Who is that boss?

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.060
Uh...

00:06:57.822 --> 00:06:59.733
I never mentioned anything about a boss.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.500
I must have misspoken.

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.860
It has to be.

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.000
Anyway, I acted alone.

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.780
I admit it,

00:07:07.755 --> 00:07:09.260
and I will take full responsibility.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.380
All right then.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.844
What was the name of the nightclub
where you took Zhou Min?

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.820
Play House.

00:07:23.088 --> 00:07:24.540
(July 2, 2009)
All teams, be alert.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.769
(Play House, Linshan City)
(Target unit clear.)

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:27.280
(All personnel are
in position at exits.)

00:07:27.288 --> 00:07:28.020
(Action.)

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:44.700
Take off your earpiece.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.740
Relax.

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:47.940
You're too tense.
Anyone could tell we're investigating.

00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:09.860
Just give it to me.

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:02.580
Sit down!

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.540
You scared the girl.

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.140
It's all right, sweetheart.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.300
Men like that are just too rough,
aren't they?

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:15.580
Come here, baby.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:17.020
Let me see if you're hurt.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.060
Let me see.

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:19.580
Don't worry.

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:21.420
I never force anyone.

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.460
It's okay, little one.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.020
You,

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.300
go take a walk.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:33.780
Stay still.

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:34.580
Let me...

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:35.580
Let me see.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:36.700
Let me take a look.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.620
Just a quick look.

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.420
They said

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.700
we have to be ready
to leave at any time tonight.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.780
Make sure the boys
downstairs stay sharp.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.088
Don't let them drink too much.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:48.940
Okay.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.060
Did he hit you here?

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.540
Let me take a look. Hurry up.

00:10:20.044 --> 00:10:21.180
Do you girls come here often?

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.740
Yeah, we're regular here.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:23.688
The vibe here is insane.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.340
Yeah, it is!

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.340
Is this the whole place?

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:32.580
There's karaoke upstairs.

00:10:36.422 --> 00:10:38.100
Want me
to treat you to a karaoke session?

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.066
The third floor is booked.
So no karaoke tonight.

00:10:40.177 --> 00:10:41.340
I wonder which rich man booked

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.180
the entire floor.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.700
What do you mean?

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.820
Skinner, time to go.

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:50.500
Hold on.

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:51.540
I booked

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:52.940
the entire third floor

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:53.980
for a week.

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:55.420
Mr. Li

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.820
is still enjoying himself.

00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.660
Leaving now

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.860
would ruin the mood.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:00.300
Enough.

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.380
It's not even your money.

00:11:01.755 --> 00:11:03.620
It's the boss's orders,
so stop complaining.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.860
He's already got his eyes on that girl.

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.020
Just keep him entertained.

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.180
Keep him interested. Got it?

00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:08.780
Okay.

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:09.300
Fine.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.060
I understand.

00:11:10.066 --> 00:11:11.555
The boss really knows how to have fun.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:17.420
Later,

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.940
you two stand by the door.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:21.340
Keep watch.

00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:36.955
Hey, man. What kind of place is this?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:37.700
Move.

00:11:37.755 --> 00:11:38.980
Why won't you let me in?

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.020
Get lost.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:43.780
Yeah, boss?

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:45.620
I'm on my way.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.340
Excuse me.

00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:15.660
Who are you?

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.740
Who let you in here?

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:18.500
Where are you taking me?

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:18.900
Come!

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:19.460
Stop!

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.300
Just move it!

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.740
Let me go!

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:40.860
Ouch!

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.340
Where's the handler?

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:52.340
Mr. Yin, they're heading downstairs.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:53.140
Move in now.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:53.820
Got it.

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:54.820
I'm on the way.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:58.700
Move!

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:02.180
Faster!

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:05.820
Move!

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:06.580
Walk!

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:07.420
Stop right there!

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.340
Stop where you are!

00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:13.340
Don't move!

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:14.180
Police!

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.020
Come here!

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:16.980
Get down!

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:21.340
Come here.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:22.420
It's okay now.

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:23.420
This way!

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:24.260
Walk!

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:29.540
(Linshan City Police Bureau)

00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.580
How were you trafficked

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:35.380
and ended up here?

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:38.780
I'm from Mount Mangqing.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.380
Two months ago,

00:14:40.533 --> 00:14:42.300
someone came
to our village offering jobs.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.860
They said
we could make good money in the city.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.180
I never thought it would be like this.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.540
Me too.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.380
I only wanted to earn a little money.

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.660
But they tricked us

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.060
and forced us...

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.100
To serve clients.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:06.540
Later, they took me to a place

00:15:07.020 --> 00:15:08.700
that looked like a forest.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.540
Some people were already waiting there.

00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:13.940
Move it!

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.780
Why are you so slow?

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.140
Keep walking!

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:18.780
Bai,

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.500
they are here.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.340
Come here.

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:21.020
Get in.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:21.500
Come here.

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.340
Get inside.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:24.340
Get in!

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.740
- Come here!
- Walk!

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:38.740
(After that,)

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.140
(they took us to a house.)
Walk!

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.580
Move it.

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:45.420
I said, walk!

00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:47.900
Stop resisting.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.740
Move it!

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:49.700
Faster!

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:10.980
Soon after,

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.620
they made us change clothes
and get in a car.

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.460
(Another girl)

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.460
(was with us.)

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:19.860
(She)

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.540
(was really brave.)

00:16:21.577 --> 00:16:23.060
(She jumped out of the car and ran.)

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:36.700
Get off.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:37.940
Faster!

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.100
Get out!

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:39.980
One by one.

00:16:39.980 --> 00:16:40.820
Get off.

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.340
Get up!

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:46.940
Go inside!

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:48.080
Walk!

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:53.900
Trying to run, huh?

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.620
Hey, she's getting away.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.500
Did they catch the one

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.220
who got away?

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:07.780
I don't know.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.300
We never saw her after that.

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:12.500
Do you remember

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.100
what those men

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:15.060
looked like?

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:22.020
Officer,

00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.820
I think

00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:25.022
there was another girl abducted

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:26.460
besides us.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.380
I saw two men dragging

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.740
and pulling her away at the time.

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:37.860
Was this the girl they took?

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.420
I don't think so.

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.711
I don't recognize this person.

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.940
Could they have caught the girl

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.222
who jumped out of the car?

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.300
It's him.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:21.220
The bald guy.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.900
(Police)

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.020
Get in!

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:38.060
Get in the car!

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:41.700
It's Number Four.

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.460
That's him!

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.220
Try it, I dare you.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:46.980
Hey, look at me.

00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:48.060
I said, look at me.

00:18:48.911 --> 00:18:49.900
Go on, shout for help.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:52.900
It's Number Four.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:54.460
It's him!

00:19:00.377 --> 00:19:02.400
(Victim: Fafa, Zhou Min)
Based on the suspects they identified,

00:19:02.422 --> 00:19:03.180
we can confirm

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.790
(Bai Wentao aka Whiteboard)
that Bai Wentao was telling the truth.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.780
But who is their handler?

00:19:08.955 --> 00:19:10.380
Both Bai Wentao and Hu Xifan appear

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.540
to be intimidated by this person.

00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:13.733
They refuse to say anything.

00:19:13.777 --> 00:19:15.550
But with them staying
tight-lipped like this

00:19:15.755 --> 00:19:17.488
and no other clues,
where do we even begin?

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:21.060
Actually, we might have one clue.

00:19:22.540 --> 00:19:23.460
What clue?

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.500
The girl who escaped.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:29.220
We don't even know who she is.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.300
True, we don't know her name.

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:31.980
But we do know

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:33.100
where she was last seen.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.700
(Bai Wentao aka Whiteboard)

00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.060
(Missing Person)

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.460
I'll go first.

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:48.500
My child has been missing

00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.060
for eleven years, three months,
and nine days.

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:53.980
Every night,

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.300
I dream about him.

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:57.100
In my dreams,

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.580
he's wearing the clothes I bought him,

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.180
crying

00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:03.020
and asking me

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.860
when I'll come to get him.

00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:08.740
Later,

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:10.780
Madam Zhang

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.140
told me

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:16.060
that my son would be fourteen by now.

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.860
He's not that little boy
from my dreams anymore.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:22.740
That's when it hit me.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:25.540
I don't even know

00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.020
what he looks like now.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:35.340
Meilian,

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:37.540
don't be too sad.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:39.980
I'm okay.

00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:42.620
Saying it out loud

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.460
makes me feel better.

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.380
Liu,

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:56.380
do you want

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.540
to share your story with everyone?

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:00.420
Okay.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.220
Here's what happened in my family.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:07.140
My wife has health issues,

00:21:07.177 --> 00:21:09.288
and my son and daughter-in-law
are both busy with work.

00:21:09.311 --> 00:21:10.580
So I was the one taking care

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.300
of my grandson, Xiaoxiao, the most.

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.500
One day,

00:21:14.555 --> 00:21:16.111
I went to pick him up from kindergarten.

00:21:16.111 --> 00:21:17.288
I was just ten minutes late.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:20.820
And in those ten minutes,

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:22.820
he was gone.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:26.860
It's all my fault.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:28.260
Liu.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:30.700
Come on, Liu.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:32.140
Don't blame yourself.

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:34.540
None of us ever wanted
something like this to happen.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.380
Don't you all agree?

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.380
The reason we're all here today

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:42.540
is that we share a belief.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.780
We believe our children

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.380
are still out there, safe.

00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:48.300
We believe

00:21:49.577 --> 00:21:50.620
they will come back to us,

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.260
healthy and whole.

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.580
That's right.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.340
My Xiaoxiao is blessed.

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.660
He'll come back just fine.

00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:01.340
Yes.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.020
Be strong.

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.140
- That will come true.
- Let's be strong.

00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:03.860
Let's stay strong.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.940
- Stay strong.
- Stay strong.

00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:07.980
Let's have faith.

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:10.500
- Have faith.
- Have faith.

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.300
Be strong.

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.140
Have faith.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:13.540
Be strong.

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:23.500
Director Deng,

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.900
we've identified

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.180
the two girls rescued yesterday.

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:29.555
I've asked Ai Xin to contact
their families to pick them up.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.460
What about the girl who ran off?
Any leads?

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:33.860
No.

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:35.500
Little Spud.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:36.700
Any leads on Little Spud?

00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:39.740
Nothing yet.

00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:45.100
To be honest,

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.340
among the younger male

00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:48.900
and female officers,

00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:50.380
you're one of the best.

00:22:52.777 --> 00:22:54.180
But investigating anti-trafficking,

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.340
we can't rush things.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.950
Every case is like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

00:22:58.950 --> 00:23:00.044
Hard to sort out.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
You have to be patient.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:06.500
Go home and get some rest.

00:23:07.022 --> 00:23:08.260
Don't stay up all night again.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:21.980
(Today,)

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.180
we have two new members

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:25.660
joining our group.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:27.980
Would you like

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.740
to share your story with us?

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:31.300
Okay.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.060
Xin,

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.780
let's tell everyone

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:36.220
about Little Spud.

00:23:36.266 --> 00:23:37.740
Maybe they can help us look for him.

00:23:37.955 --> 00:23:39.333
The more eyes, the better.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.220
He's right.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:41.500
Please, tell us.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:43.620
Come, dear.

00:23:49.488 --> 00:23:51.066
She's not in a good place right now.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:52.500
Maybe let others go first.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:53.620
Sorry about that.

00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:54.900
It's okay.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:55.860
Have a seat.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.780
Everyone, please don't worry.

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:00.260
I truly believe

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.860
that we will find

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.340
our children again.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:04.860
Lately,

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.820
I've come to believe

00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:07.660
that

00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.180
the spiritual connection
between people is real.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:12.220
Professor John Taylor

00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:13.460
from UC Berkeley

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.620
has even proven it.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.460
The trigger mechanism

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.300
is complicated.

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.420
But I believe

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.620
blood ties

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.860
create the strongest bonds.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.940
I truly believe that we will reunite

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.380
with our children in the near future.

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:28.580
We will.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:29.700
Yes.

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:30.555
We absolutely will.

00:24:30.555 --> 00:24:31.860
We'll definitely find them.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:32.660
Have faith.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:33.780
Stay strong.

00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:34.620
We can do this.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.340
Be strong and have faith.

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.340
Hang in there.

00:24:39.822 --> 00:24:40.820
Let's hang in there.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:41.500
Have faith.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.340
Be strong.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:44.740
Do you even hear yourself?

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:51.140
Your child is missing,

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:52.700
and instead of searching,

00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:54.860
you're here talking
about psychic connections?

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.500
Ms. Cai.

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:55.900
Stop...

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.660
I understand how you feel.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.700
We've all been through this.

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:00.660
Besides, the professor...

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:01.780
Why did you bring me here?

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.300
Do you really think listening

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.540
to these people will help, Lin Hao?

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:07.980
Xin.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.777
One child has been missing
for three years.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.780
Another for eleven.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:15.580
Madam Zhang's child
has been gone for twenty years.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.100
Instead of looking for them,

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.288
they're sitting here talking
about telepathy?

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.180
Uh...

00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:23.060
Ms. Cai,

00:25:23.060 --> 00:25:24.180
hear me out.

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.260
Everyone here has been through

00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:27.980
the same thing.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:29.980
We understand

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.900
how you feel.

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.860
Oh, you understand?

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:38.580
Yes, we do.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:40.500
But I don't get any of you.

00:25:40.666 --> 00:25:41.540
Honestly, I don't.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.844
Why are you all
just sitting around, sighing,

00:25:43.844 --> 00:25:45.220
pretending everything's okay,

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.220
avoiding reality,

00:25:46.460 --> 00:25:47.620
and wasting time?

00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:49.980
Xin...

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.940
The kids won't come back on their own!

00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:57.300
I'm sorry about that.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.220
Xin!

00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.180
Xin!

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.460
(Missing Person: Luo Xiaoyu)

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.020
(Police)

00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:31.111
(Lin Yangyu; Zheng Weiwei)

00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:35.980
If we

00:26:36.311 --> 00:26:39.577
look at the entire chain, from luring
and abducting, to control and transport,

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:40.460
transit,

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:41.180
hand off,

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:42.060
sale,

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.100
and payment,

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.100
is it possible

00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:46.900
that somewhere along the way,

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.220
the criminals trafficking girls

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.460
and those trafficking kids

00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:50.740
might cross paths

00:26:50.740 --> 00:26:51.860
in terms of time or venue?

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.100
Like Bai Wentao.

00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:56.740
He was trafficking girls,

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.111
but he could've been involved
in child trafficking too.

00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:02.100
Normally,

00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:03.980
trafficking girls

00:27:04.311 --> 00:27:06.555
and trafficking kids
are two separate operations.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.980
Then we have to figure out

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.700
how Luoluo ended up
in Bai Wentao's hands.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.660
Maybe there's someone
who knows something

00:27:15.666 --> 00:27:16.577
or a middleman.

00:27:16.688 --> 00:27:17.860
If we can find that person,

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.020
we might crack

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.300
the child trafficking ring.

00:27:22.155 --> 00:27:23.420
But where do we even start?

00:27:23.977 --> 00:27:26.340
He keeps insisting
that Luoluo was a child he adopted.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.740
And we haven't found
any witnesses or middlemen.

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:31.060
How do we connect these two cases?

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:34.540
It's clear

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.622
we're not getting anything

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.955
about his handler from Bai Wentao.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:37.660
So

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:39.020
our only hope now is

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.060
to find the girl

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:40.980
who got away.

00:27:42.740 --> 00:27:43.420
All right.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:44.900
Mr. Yin, stay here and coordinate.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.340
The rest, come with me

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.540
to find her.

00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:04.020
Thank you.

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.340
Listen.

00:28:06.622 --> 00:28:08.688
I get that finding
the child is the top priority.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:09.580
But

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:10.420
I think the mom

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.020
is close to a breakdown.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:15.580
When someone loses
their emotional anchor,

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.700
they will collapse.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:17.688
Do you get what I mean?

00:28:18.044 --> 00:28:19.311
If it really comes to that,

00:28:19.422 --> 00:28:21.290
maybe they should consider having
another one.

00:28:22.300 --> 00:28:24.140
Just so she has something to hold on to.

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:25.700
I understand. Thank you
for your concern.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:26.780
Okay, I'll get going then.

00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:28.340
Okay, take care.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.660
Think

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:30.780
about what I said.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.580
See you.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.550
I'll take my leave then.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:48.780
Xin.

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.580
What did Aunt say?

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:57.940
Nothing.

00:28:58.511 --> 00:28:59.622
Give birth to another one?

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.260
Give birth to what?

00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:03.980
You misheard.

00:29:03.980 --> 00:29:05.060
Mom, I'm not deaf.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.660
What did she mean by that?

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.020
Mom,

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.660
Little Spud is my child.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.900
He's not some object

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.220
you can just replace.

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:18.740
How could she say something like this?

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:21.820
She meant well.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.380
Seriously?

00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.340
Do you think she meant well?

00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:34.260
It sounds like
Aunt struck a nerve in you.

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.220
You want me to have another one too,
don't you?

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:38.060
Of course not.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.460
Xin, you got me wrong.

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:41.644
I never had that intention.

00:29:41.644 --> 00:29:43.180
That's what you want, isn't it?

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:44.180
No, that's not it.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:46.300
Then why did she suddenly show up today?

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.380
Did you ask her

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:49.620
to say all that?

00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:51.460
Let me make this clear, Mom.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.660
I only have one child.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:54.780
I will never have another!

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.980
If that's how you see it,

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.980
then you don't deserve
to be his grandmother!

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:58.380
I...

00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.109
I never...

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.850
Mom didn't mean
you should have another one!

00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:01.260
She only...

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:02.180
Only what?

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:02.740
Stop it.

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:03.580
Say it!

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.900
Tell me what your family
really wants, Lin Hao?

00:30:06.066 --> 00:30:07.780
Who gave her the right
to say those things?

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.200
Who is she to even say that?

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.500
If it weren't for her, our son
wouldn't have gone missing!

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.900
What? Have you lost your mind?

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:13.780
What am I saying?

00:30:13.780 --> 00:30:15.460
I'm losing my mind because of you!

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.780
Why are you yelling at me?

00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.580
Stop. Please stop.

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.460
You only care about your mom.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:23.020
She's the one who lost him, not me!

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.900
Who are you to blame me?

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.860
It was your family

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.220
who came to tell me
to have another child!

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.300
Stick to the issue!

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:30.020
It's not like

00:30:30.020 --> 00:30:31.340
Mom lost Little Spud on purpose!

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:31.620
Enough!

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:32.020
Okay.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:32.700
Stop it already.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.980
Stick to the issue, right?

00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:34.940
Fine!

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.460
You want another child so badly?

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:37.219
Let's get a divorce.

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.822
Go find someone else
to have a baby with!

00:30:38.822 --> 00:30:40.100
Who said I wanted another kid?

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.060
Your whole family did!

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.620
Stop it, Hao!

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.300
(Baby Missing)

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:48.220
Enough already.

00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:55.500
Xin,

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:00.260
I am also a mother.

00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.020
I understand everything

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:04.700
you said to me today.

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:08.260
Losing the child

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.140
broke me too!

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:15.220
I blame myself every single day.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:17.660
If I could,

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:21.660
I would trade my life to bring him back.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:41.540
Hello?

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.900
Mr. Lin, I know where your son is.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.540
Mom,

00:31:49.755 --> 00:31:51.020
there's news about Little Spud.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.500
Okay.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:55.740
I'll head over.

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:09.580
Hello.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:11.180
Are you the one who called us?

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.060
Please have a seat.

00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:12.900
Okay.

00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.100
She's my wife, Cai Xin.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:14.940
This is my mother.

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:16.500
Hello.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:17.980
Where's the child now?

00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:20.500
Ms. Cai, calm down.

00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:21.660
Everyone, calm down.

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.380
My name is Zhao Zhilong.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:25.620
I'm a volunteer
with a community outreach group.

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.140
My cousin happened

00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.260
to see the child.

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:32.900
Well,

00:32:33.111 --> 00:32:34.533
we had posted a missing child notice

00:32:34.577 --> 00:32:36.900
in our "Hoping for Our Child's Return"
group chat.

00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:39.220
I usually upload
the info online right away.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.500
Yes, we also uploaded it.

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.340
Coincidentally,

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:42.820
my cousin saw it.

00:32:43.533 --> 00:32:45.460
The child had a black mole
on his back, right?

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.140
Yes, a black mole.

00:32:47.377 --> 00:32:49.022
That's something we remember clearly.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.700
Here, take a look.

00:32:58.711 --> 00:32:59.740
It looks just like him.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:00.460
Yes, that's him.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.460
It's definitely him.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:02.300
My cousin said

00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:04.100
he saw the child in Lianxiang Town.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:05.500
Lianxiang Town?

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.220
Let's get over there now.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:08.820
Take a seat first.

00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:10.940
Sit.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.700
Lianxiang Town

00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:17.300
isn't that big

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.020
or small either.

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:20.900
But it's still a town.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.980
If you rush over there like this,

00:33:23.333 --> 00:33:24.820
do you think it's safe for the child?

00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.180
You mean we might alert the traffickers?

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:29.200
Is that right, Mr. Zhao?

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:31.900
So, what should we do?

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:35.300
I'll call my cousin.

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:37.740
He knows the area well.

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.260
I'll have him scout around

00:33:39.577 --> 00:33:40.980
and figure out a general location.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:42.020
Great. Thank you.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:42.740
Don't worry.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:43.900
He's just as kind-hearted

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:44.980
as I am.

00:33:45.044 --> 00:33:46.590
He'll do everything he can to help you.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:47.060
Okay?

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.060
Thank you so much.

00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:48.740
Okay.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.060
Also, there's one more thing.

00:33:52.422 --> 00:33:53.940
I need you to promise me one thing.

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:56.420
What is it?

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.460
I will do everything I can
to help you find your child.

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.100
But once we do,

00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:03.980
you must not involve the police.

00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:07.980
Why not?

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:10.900
Madam,

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.100
child trafficking is a serious crime.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:16.460
If the traffickers find out,

00:34:16.644 --> 00:34:18.880
they might get desperate
and do something extreme.

00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:20.980
I hope you...

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:21.620
Don't worry.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:22.900
We won't call the police.

00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:23.911
I'll make sure they don't.

00:34:23.933 --> 00:34:24.820
Yes.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:26.500
We promise.

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:27.940
Okay.

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.340
Go home and pack.
I'll send the details once I have them.

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:31.700
- Thank you, Mr. Zhao.
- Thank you!

00:34:31.711 --> 00:34:32.420
Thank you.

00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:34.180
Let us know
the moment you hear anything.

00:34:35.866 --> 00:34:37.688
I don't trust that man.
Something feels off.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.180
I feel like he's connected

00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:43.700
to the people who took our child.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.420
I don't care
if he is connected to them or not.

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.940
What matters is getting my child back.

00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:48.980
I only care about that!

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.420
Xin, listen. You need to calm...

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.900
Mom, let's head there first.

00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:52.740
Don't say anything.

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:55.900
Let's go.

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:58.980
Based on what the two girls said,

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.466
the third girl escaped

00:35:00.466 --> 00:35:02.660
while they were being transferred
to the Play House.

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.380
We've already checked

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.140
all the surveillance around that area.

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:07.860
But there's no useful footage or leads.

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.500
And there haven't been

00:35:10.820 --> 00:35:12.820
any recent reports
of missing or distressed girls.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.180
I suspect

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.020
she may have already left Linshan City.

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.500
Mu Lang's team is after her,

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.755
but they haven't found
any trace of her in the city.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:23.420
I think

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.020
she has headed south,

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:27.700
toward Pengcang Town.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:30.860
Hurry up and eat.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.622
We're heading to Pengcang Town
after this.

00:35:33.688 --> 00:35:35.622
Don't forget
the infant formula and baby bottle.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:36.580
I got them.

00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:37.820
What else should we bring?

00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.260
Take a whole pack of diapers.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.100
Okay.

00:35:41.220 --> 00:35:42.380
Don't forget to bring your ID.

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:43.700
Hao.

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.866
Mom, we need to leave soon
or we won't make it in time.

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:48.260
Shouldn't we call Director Deng?

00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:49.020
No need!

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.660
She's right. We can update her later.

00:35:50.900 --> 00:35:52.820
My ID should be in my bag.

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.420
Okay.

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:55.300
I still think
we should involve the police.

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.260
Mom, didn't you hear him?

00:35:58.260 --> 00:35:59.380
He told us not to.

00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:01.900
I'll just call Yanyan.

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.140
She is not an outsider.

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:05.755
If the police could solve this,
they would've found him by now.

00:36:05.755 --> 00:36:06.460
Yeah.

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.220
Mom,

00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:10.940
can you not make this harder
than it already is?

00:36:16.244 --> 00:36:17.711
We're making a move now, Mom.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:19.860
Did you bring it all?

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:20.700
Let's get going.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:36.740
(Pengcang Town)

00:36:43.066 --> 00:36:44.140
(Signature Stir-Fry Dish)

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:44.980
Hello, Mister.

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:46.460
What would you like to eat?

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:47.940
Our food's authentic.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.111
The fish is really fresh.

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:50.980
Sorry, can you give us a minute?

00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:52.260
Why are we here?

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:54.900
What's your specialty?

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:56.260
Pickled fish stew.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.220
Ah, pickled fish is popular here.

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.260
Is yours authentic?

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.300
Don't worry.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:03.700
My family has been here
in Pengcang for generations.

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.020
This recipe has been passed down

00:37:05.020 --> 00:37:06.200
for more than ten generations.

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:07.088
Guaranteed authentic.

00:37:07.133 --> 00:37:07.900
Really?

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:08.740
I'll try one.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:09.620
Coming right up.

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:10.580
One pickled fish.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.300
Didn't you already eat?

00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.140
We might as well try the local food
now that we're here.

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:17.420
We're not here for food.

00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:18.500
We're here for work.

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.177
Even when you're working,
you've got to eat.

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:33.500
It's here.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:34.700
Yes.

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:41.700
(Community Cooperative)

00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:45.820
This is the place.

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.780
(Rural Credit Cooperative)
Yes, we're at the right place.

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:49.977
Rural Credit Cooperative.

00:37:53.644 --> 00:37:54.500
Is this the cousin?

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:55.140
Yeah.

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:55.980
Hello.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:56.820
Hello.

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.620
You must be Mr. Lin and Ms. Cai.

00:37:58.620 --> 00:37:59.940
Yes, we are. Hello.

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:01.180
I'm Zhao Zhilong's cousin.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.140
You can call me Wang.

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:02.980
Nice to meet you.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.620
Where's my child?

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:05.460
Calm down.

00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:06.780
My cousin should've explained

00:38:06.780 --> 00:38:08.460
the situation to you.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.260
We know the child is still

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:11.220
in our town.

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.580
But we can't confirm

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.220
which family took him in.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.900
I think

00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:16.780
we'll need more people

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.620
to help ask around.

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.340
How many of you came this time?

00:38:20.060 --> 00:38:20.980
Just a few of us.

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.019
If there were too many people,
it would attract attention.

00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:24.060
Okay, let me think.

00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:26.180
How about this?

00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.580
Let's split up.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:28.740
I've marked

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:29.740
a few locations here.

00:38:29.933 --> 00:38:31.020
You go check those spots.

00:38:31.066 --> 00:38:32.540
(Lincheng Supermarket, Lianxiang Town)
I'll get some friends to help too.

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:33.755
(Children's Store, Street Market)

00:38:33.755 --> 00:38:34.860
Oh, this is my number.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.500
Call me if anything comes up.

00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:37.860
Okay.

00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:42.020
Don't worry.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:42.940
You'll find him.

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:49.940
(Lianxiang Town's Lincheng Supermarket,
Children's Store, Street Market)

00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:56.060
Hello, have you seen this child?

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:00.380
No.

00:39:00.688 --> 00:39:01.500
Never seen him.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:02.940
Take a closer look.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.140
He has a round face
and is really cheerful.

00:39:07.060 --> 00:39:08.020
I don't recognize him.

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:08.860
Sorry.

00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:15.380
Madam,

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.580
could you please take a look?

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:17.940
Have you seen this child?

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.500
A few days ago,

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.420
I saw someone carrying a kid
who looked like this.

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.140
Yeah, it's him.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:29.900
Are you sure

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:30.700
it's him?

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:31.820
Of course, I'm sure.

00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:32.460
This child

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:33.340
is chubby

00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:34.380
and smiles at everyone.

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.300
I even played with him.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.220
Do you know where he is now?

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.660
No idea.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.460
But it was definitely that kid.

00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.020
They came to the market.

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.060
They probably live nearby.

00:39:45.860 --> 00:39:47.420
Xin, we're close to finding him.

00:39:47.466 --> 00:39:48.822
I think we've almost found him.

00:39:48.822 --> 00:39:49.644
We'll find him soon.

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:55.860
Hello?

00:39:58.100 --> 00:39:59.220
Okay.

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.222
We're heading there now.

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:01.500
What's the update?

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:03.300
They found him.

00:40:03.660 --> 00:40:04.860
Let's go. Where?

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:06.660
Hurry!

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:13.700
The bill, please.

00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:14.940
Okay.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:16.420
How much?

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:18.220
Food was good, right?

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:19.780
I finished everything. See there?

00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:20.860
I told you

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:22.220
it's authentic.

00:40:23.488 --> 00:40:24.580
That would be 132 yuan.

00:40:25.244 --> 00:40:26.420
I'll give you a 50% discount.

00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:27.220
It's okay.

00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.177
We'll pay this amount.

00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:29.740
That's a lot.

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.500
You'll take us to the place after this,

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.340
right?

00:40:32.644 --> 00:40:33.780
Of course, I'll take you.

00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:38.700
Did you solve the case?

00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:40.620
Get in.

00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:51.540
Buddy, hurry up!

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:52.700
Coming!

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:01.700
Turn left up ahead.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:05.340
Mr. Lin,

00:41:05.540 --> 00:41:06.980
my friend just sent this photo.

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.220
Take a look.

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:12.220
It looks like him.

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.060
That's our child.

00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:14.900
Let's go and get him now.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.460
Where is he now?

00:41:18.780 --> 00:41:19.620
Well,

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:21.660
my friend

00:41:21.940 --> 00:41:23.020
is currently near

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.220
the buyer's house.

00:41:24.911 --> 00:41:26.555
But he didn't give me the exact address.

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:28.380
I'm only helping out.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:29.220
He's not the same.

00:41:30.533 --> 00:41:31.755
How much is he asking?

00:41:35.422 --> 00:41:36.500
Twenty thousand yuan?

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:38.620
Two hundred thousand.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.060
What?

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.500
Mr. Lin, I'm really trying to help.

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:45.860
I'm not keeping the money.

00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:47.180
I...

00:41:47.266 --> 00:41:48.444
Two hundred thousand, it is.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.860
Okay. I'll get in touch with them.

00:41:51.860 --> 00:41:52.980
Be patient.

00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:55.660
Xin,

00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.860
we don't have that much money.

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.620
This is the shop I mentioned.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.100
It's run

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:11.580
by Madam Liu,

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.380
nicknamed Chatterbox.

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:15.700
There's nothing in this town
she doesn't know.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:20.780
Madam Liu,

00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:23.260
he's my friend.

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.380
- How do you do?
- He's hoping to ask you something.

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:27.950
I'll leave you to it, okay?

00:42:27.955 --> 00:42:28.660
Okay, thanks.

00:42:28.711 --> 00:42:29.533
I'll leave you to it.

00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.380
Okay.

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:31.940
Our shop is the busiest

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.500
on this street.

00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:34.700
We offer fair prices,

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:35.755
so we have many customers.

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:36.500
So, of course,

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:37.700
I hear things.

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:38.460
Perfect.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:40.060
Feel free to look around.

00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:41.140
Okay.

00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:44.020
Madam,

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:46.340
I used to eat this candy as a kid.

00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.700
I haven't seen it in years.

00:42:48.133 --> 00:42:49.540
I can't believe you have them.

00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:50.577
I'll take all of these.

00:42:50.577 --> 00:42:51.340
Okay.

00:42:52.620 --> 00:42:54.340
Madam, you've lived here a long time.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:58.100
Have you seen any young girls
from out of town lately?

00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.820
Yes, there's one.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.140
