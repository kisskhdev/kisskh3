[This time is]

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.240
[different from before.]

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.520
[You must unleash]

[your potential.]

[My lady.]

[Lady Tiger.]

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.840
Here you are, honey!

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.120
My dear!

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.560
I've missed you so much!

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.000
Look at you.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.280
How skinny you are!

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.560
Don't tease me!

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.880
I love you too much

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.720
to ever tease you!

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.800
I tell you...

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.080
She looks a bit fatter on camera.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.919
I don't think so.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.199
She's not that fat.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.560
That's not a lunch box.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.520
That's a rice barrel!

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.120
You're so clumsy with words!

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.360
I'll send my assistant

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.160
over to you tomorrow.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.960
It's a deal.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.680
Deal.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.200
Sorry.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.000
It's okay.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.600
Alright?

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.720
Do you remember Miss Lan

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.120
who just won Best Actress?

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.600
Days ago,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.640
I met her on an event.

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:26.640
Her figure

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.920
is the result of relentless dieting.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.440
I saw her savoring

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.520
every single leaf of lettuce.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.160
My gosh!

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.240
Don't follow her example!

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.560
That's not your style

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.560
and bad for your health.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.079
Alright. Let me introduce.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.920
Come here.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.800
I'm Zhang Ran. Nice to meet you.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.600
Nice to meet you.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.120
My entire family are your fans.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.960
My parents watch

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.960
your videos every day.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.400
They follow your daily meal plan.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.840
You're always making them laugh.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.920
Thank you! Your

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.920
entire family

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:49.960
are my bread and butter.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.800
You're making me blush.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.560
Just let yourself go

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:53.880
during acting.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:54.960
Don't be nervous.

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:55.880
Okay.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.400
We'll go get ready.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.600
Wait. I'll introduce

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.480
you to the director.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.720
His videos have all gone viral.

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.880
Director.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.680
Nice to meet you.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.640
We've met before.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.880
Ten years ago.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.400
I remember you.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.840
Ran, it's the director.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.800
Handshake!

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.440
Okay.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.960
You're Mr. Yu, right?

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.960
Yes.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.360
Director.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.640
Nice to meet you.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.600
We'll go get ready.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:21.320
Go get changed.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.920
See you in a bit.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.040
Okay, see you.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.000
See what she got?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.200
That's way too much!

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.920
I believe you can do it.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.600
I can't!

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.800
You can. I believe you.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.079
I'm going to persuade her.

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.480
Then you'll have to do that too.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.720
Director!

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.800
Wipe on my sleeve, Ran.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.240
Come on.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.360
Is this rainproof fabric?

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.680
Then wipe on here.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.200
Bo.

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.960
Is anyone outside?

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.280
Yes.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.720
Me.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.200
What?

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.600
Is this going to work?

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.280
I can't believe it.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.960
Well...

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.360
What?

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.480
Ran.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.560
What do you think?

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.240
To be honest, Ran.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.120
I don't know whether it's going to work,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.120
but I can tell

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.040
that you're working hard.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.720
Really.

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:22.880
Shut up.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.320
I'd ruin my reputation.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.080
Ran, hurry.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.960
Come over here!

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.200
Have you memorized

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.960
all the dance moves?

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:38.480
Yes.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:39.240
Okay.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.360
The four of us

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.640
have identical figures.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.040
As long as we move in unison,

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.000
they'll think we're the same.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.040
Come a little closer.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.760
No one will notice the difference.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.360
Let's practice it again.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.200
Come and sit.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.400
You can do it. Ready.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.880
Girls, stick your heads out!

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.080
Royal Laundry!

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.720
Follow the beat!

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.360
Wash it!

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.120
Harder!

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.640
Harder!

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.200
Faster!

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.840
Come on!

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.360
[Hello, hello.]

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.360
[Test. One, two.]

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:56.280
[Hello, everybody.]

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.760
[Welcome to]

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.840
[Today's Financial Interview.]

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.840
[I'm the host, Zhang Ran.]

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.800
[Life seems to happen unexpectedly.]

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.000
[I thought I would be an interpreter.]

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.680
[But now,]

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.680
[I am a host instead.]

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.520
Over there!

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:13.960
Why does Ran's dancing

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.880
look so pitiful?

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.360
No.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.720
You don't know her.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.040
Really?

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.320
[Come on!]

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.320
[Follow me! Royal Laundry!]

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:59.760
[Go!]

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.880
I knew you have talent.

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.720
Lady Tiger's team

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.040
spoke highly of Zhang Ran.

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.440
They want to work with her again.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.640
I went out on a limb to sign you.

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.880
I knew you

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.880
wouldn't let me down.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.920
Look at

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:21.800
this rising data.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.880
Faster than anyone else in the company.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.080
All thanks to both of you.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.440
I never imagined it

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.520
would come to this.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.880
It's a lucky accident.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.720
I will keep working hard.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.600
Anran.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:39.960
Guys.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.000
Have a seat.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.320
Anran. Please have a seat.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.360
I'm fine.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.640
Congratulations!

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.159
Thank you.

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:47.640
You've become an overnight sensation!

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.159
Everyone is talking about you.

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:49.800
Congratulations!

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.159
Thank you for your encouragement.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.400
This one is for

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:53.960
Mr. Lin.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.960
I've had it.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.640
Here.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.080
Ladies first.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.480
Great!

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.040
Anran.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.520
Lady Tiger intends to continue

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.080
collaborating with Zhang Ran.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.480
You've got to work harder.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.280
That's silly.

00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.280
That's cute.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.440
Since everyone's here,

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.400
I'll say a few words.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.160
Okay.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.080
Zhang Ran's success also

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.120
represents an exploration

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.200
in collaboration for our company.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:32.960
This exploration

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.240
proved to be quite effective.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.640
We will press ahead.

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.200
This isn't my first

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.520
venture into entrepreneurship,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
but it's the one

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.280
where I've given it my absolute all.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.560
Why?

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.360
Because this endeavor

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.800
is so meaningful.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.480
It brings joy to the people.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.360
It's very important.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.080
With more effort from you,

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.600
the world will have more joy

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.240
and less sorrow

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.000
for the families.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.680
We are not

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:07.920
merely fulfilling

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.640
company KPIs.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.640
We are cultivating ourselves.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:32.760
[Only after this job did I realize]

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.680
[how much work there is]

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.240
[at an overseas education agency.]

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.640
[Though it's tough at first,]

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
[it's also]

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.120
[fulfilling.]

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.720
[All I want now is to]

00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:44.440
[have my own...]

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:52.040
[...have my own client.]

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.360
[Then I'd get a commission.]

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:53.920
[I'll]

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.000
[treat you to malatang then.]

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:02.960
Hello?

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.880
[Hello, Kaiyang.]

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.520
[I'm Yu.]

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:05.680
[I apologize for my]

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.480
[attitude last time.]

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.960
[We've heard]

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.680
[about your family.]

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:09.680
[Please take care.]

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.120
[Look,]

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.640
[I just met a guy who could]

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.280
[be a big help to your family.]

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.520
[You must come meet him.]

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.400
[I'll send the address.]

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.160
[See you.]

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.600
Hello, sir.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.280
Hello.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.160
Who are you looking for?

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.720
Have you clocked out for the day?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.400
No.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.760
I'm still on duty.

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.360
I'm here to consult about

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.720
my child's study abroad options.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.960
People say you're

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.640
the best agency

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.440
in Lucheng City.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.920
I'm here to ask for advice.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:56.680
I see.

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.400
I'm the consultant.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.520
You can come to me

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.320
if you need anything.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.520
I'm Lu.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:02.480
That's great!

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.720
Thank you.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.640
I'm Gu.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.200
[I've read the contract.]

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.400
[I'm okay with it.]

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.720
[I'll go with the most expensive]

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.480
[all-inclusive package.]

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.880
[Just take care]

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.040
[of everything for my child.]

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.800
[And,]

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.520
[the application deadline is approaching.]

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.160
[Please hurry up.]

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.960
Okay, no problem.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.480
Mr. Gu.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.840
I'll find you the best

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.440
consultant tomorrow.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.760
[No need.]

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.600
[You can work on it.]

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.160
[You must be responsible]

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:28.960
[to work this late.]

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:29.680
[I choose you.]

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:30.840
Okay.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.880
I can do it, Mr. Gu.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:32.400
[Alright then.]

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.080
Tomorrow, I...

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.240
I've brought you drinks.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:52.800
Thank you so much.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.960
You're all sweaty from the rush.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.240
How's the setup here?

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.240
Pretty good?

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.120
Yeah?

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.200
It's going to rain.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:01.800
Let's get

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:02.840
down to business.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.280
Don't be in such a hurry.

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.840
Let me make the introductions.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.040
Bro.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:08.800
Kaiyang.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.040
And this is Sis.

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.000
Kaiyang.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.960
Tonight, your problem

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.360
will be taken care of.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.040
If there's nothing else, I'll leave then.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:20.520
Kaiyang, I need to talk to you.

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:21.680
I fished

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.040
here all day and didn't

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.560
catch a single fish.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.240
The boss said I'm not skilled enough.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.120
I wasn't happy about it.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:28.960
Kaiyang.

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.440
If the fish didn't behave,

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:31.640
we must discipline it.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.840
The same goes for a person.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:34.720
Yeah?

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.440
I've got things to do.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:37.480
Kaiyang.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.800
If you're still my friend,

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.800
you've got to help me out.

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:41.320
You won't have come in vain.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.400
You will be rewarded.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.560
I've got this fish up here.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:46.600
Boom!

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.200
How about it?

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.440
I've already resolved most of it.

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.880
But the more I think, the angrier I get.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.000
This place

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.240
must be burned down today.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:56.560
Give us a hand.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.360
Yu.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.560
What are you doing?

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:00.880
Don't be a coward.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.560
I won't shortchange you on money.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:03.240
80,000 yuan.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:04.760
Or I'll make it 88,000?

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:05.440
What are you doing?

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.640
Just take it!

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.040
Take it!

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.960
Do nothing but take it!

00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:11.680
It's worth 88,000 yuan!

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.440
Leave the rest of the work to me!

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.760
Kaiyang!

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.440
Kaiyang!

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:20.880
Kaiyang!

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.960
Kaiyang!

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.320
Kaiyang!

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.840
Kaiyang!

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.880
Call the police!

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.240
Run! This way!

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:35.480
Stop there!

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.240
What did you do?

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.160
Get them!

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.120
Get them! Call the police!

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.160
It's not me!

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.280
We saw you!

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:41.960
Liar!

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.720
Hold him down! Call the police!

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.160
Stop!

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.880
Don't let them get away!

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:47.840
Stop!

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.200
Have you caught the rest of them?

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.320
Yes.

00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:58.480
Pal.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.000
What have you done?

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.600
Go ahead and tell me about it.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:09.800
Ge Kaiyang.

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:12.120
How about now?

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.520
If you remember,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.520
tell me about your family

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.640
and your address.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.640
I checked it.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:25.760
His parents are imprisoned

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:27.680
for illegal fundraising.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.320
Do you have any other

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.400
relatives to help you?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.320
Only a dog remains.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.320
If I were to stay here,

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.360
I'm afraid it would

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.400
starve to death.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.800
You won't be able

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.400
to go out anytime soon.

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.680
It'll take at least 15 days.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.480
Is your dog at your

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:50.760
registered address?

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:53.920
Alright.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.040
We'll ask the neighborhood

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:55.680
committee for help.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.680
Go back to your seat.

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.280
This big client of yours is really great.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.240
I hear this rich man

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.360
doesn't have any

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.040
complicated demands.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.600
Whatever you say goes.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:21.480
Great.

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.200
He's just in a hurry.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:24.920
The application

00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.200
deadline is approaching.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:28.720
He just wants to spend money

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.880
to get his daughter

00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.960
a degree abroad.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.960
He doesn't care about school rankings.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:33.960
How enviable!

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.880
He doesn't care about rankings

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:37.320
and doesn't skimp on tuition.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.800
You are free to choose

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.000
any school and apply it.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.040
When will I ever get

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.360
such easy work?

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.480
I didn't treat it easily.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.400
I've applied to

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:48.880
over twenty schools and

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:50.280
prepared materials every night.

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.160
I'm exhausted.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.680
Over twenty?

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:53.800
Are you done yet?

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:54.720
Yes.

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.720
They've been submitted.

00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.240
You're good!

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.200
You're sure to

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.280
get this month's bonus.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:00.320
Treat me to a meal?

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:01.520
Okay.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.560
How about malatang?

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.119
Malatang doesn't

00:17:05.119 --> 00:17:06.240
match your bonus.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.280
Something fancier.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.920
Don't look down on malatang!

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.359
I want something fancy!

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:12.560
Don't push your luck!

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.240
Lu Xinying!

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:14.280
Yes?

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:15.880
The boss is looking for you.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.680
Why is she looking for me?

00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.440
Is she giving you a bonus?

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:20.920
I'll go take a look.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:21.760
See you.

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:23.119
Good luck.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:23.520
Okay.

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.200
Mr. Gu.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:29.800
Finally.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.440
See for yourself.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.560
And these.

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.440
These are

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:38.960
the materials I prepared for Beibei.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:39.560
Is there a problem?

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.200
So you know

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.000
they're application materials.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.560
What's wrong?

00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:47.000
I'll tell you what's wrong.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.600
Check this.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.280
And this.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.440
Are they the same?

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.160
This is the template

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:58.160
I sent her.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.120
I told her she needed

00:17:59.120 --> 00:17:59.880
to change

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.000
the school's name to

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:01.920
the one she was

00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.600
applying to before submitting.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.320
You told her?

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:07.040
Yes, I told her.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:08.240
Look, I've told her

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:08.800
both in the group chat

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:09.600
and via email.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.600
I don't care.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:12.760
Look,

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:13.880
I made it

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.720
perfectly clear

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.960
from day one that I needed

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.000
someone to handle

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.680
everything

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.400
from start to finish.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.480
All-Inclusive package,

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.000
you know?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.080
Don't you know what it is?

00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:22.840
I know.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.320
I had intended to help her

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:25.720
modify the template

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.400
and had asked her for

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.240
her email password.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:28.960
But she refused,

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.960
saying it was

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.120
her personal privacy.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:31.920
So I couldn't.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.680
Was she wrong?

00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.840
It is her personal privacy!

00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:35.000
This showed

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.040
she's cautious!

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.440
Listen.

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:38.640
This concerns

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.360
my daughter's future.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:41.800
If I don't get

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:42.920
an explanation, your agency

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.560
won't be able to operate.

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:45.800
Mr. Gu.

00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.120
We'll give you a

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.160
satisfactory response today.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.880
[Xinying, stop making excuses.]

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.280
[In any case,]

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.160
[you have already had]

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.320
[an impact on our company.]

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:56.080
[If it weren't for the fact]

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:56.800
[that you're broke]

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:58.240
[but diligent at work,]

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.160
[I'd make you pay for all]

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.440
[the damages and fire you.]

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.760
[I've decided with HR]

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.200
[to withhold your salary]

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.400
[and bonus for this month.]

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.720
[You really need to work twice as hard]

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.280
[to repay me]

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:10.280
[and the company.]

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.280
Yes?

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:39.960
Aiying.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.280
I just dreamed

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.320
about you last night.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.880
Really?

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.520
Yeah.

00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:47.560
That's sister connection.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.120
What would you like for dinner?

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.760
I'll cook it for you.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.240
You know nothing about cooking.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.600
Let me cook for you.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:05.920
Is there something you want from me?

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:09.640
I'm ok.

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.760
Your face says it all.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:15.240
I'm fine.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.000
I just miss you.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.280
Did Lu Ming upset you?

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.800
Then it must be Lu Xinying.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:30.240
Don't mention those two to me.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:32.960
None of them are any good.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:43.120
If you have something to say, spit it out.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.000
Don't keep me waiting.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.840
Lu Xinying

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:52.560
is back.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.240
I thought it was something big.

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.760
She misses you.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.480
That's not true.

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.080
She had a perfectly good

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.880
bank job in Canada

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.680
and she just dropped it and came back.

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.920
And she didn't just return today.

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.640
She's been back for a while now.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.800
Lu Ming even knows about it.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.120
The two of them are in cahoots,

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:12.320
keeping it from me all along.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:18.160
What kind of father is this?

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.760
He has no sense of right or wrong.

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.880
He told me it was fine

00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:22.960
that she could

00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:24.800
find a decent job.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.880
I'm open

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.680
to hearing their thoughts.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.400
They stood before me,

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.680
painting a grand picture of the future,

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.040
and I actually bought into it.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.480
It almost felt like

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.200
having them around was nice

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.600
and the job seemed respectable enough.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.840
Then at least put in some effort.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.080
She just started and she's already taking leave.

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:47.600
I said, Ying

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.560
how could you do this?

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:49.800
You just started this job.

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.880
You should at least try to make a good impression.

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.680
How can you just take leave like that?

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.600
You're sick or not feeling well?

00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.880
She tells me a friend has something going on.

00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.680
I ask, what friend?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.080
A friend

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:01.800
who's not even close.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.200
Same.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:07.000
Zhang Ran is no different.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.040
Getting married on a whim

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.000
then poof, she's gone.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.560
And then she just got divorced out of nowhere.

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.240
I haven't even processed it yet,

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.480
and she remarried.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.560
And I'm always the last one

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:18.720
to be informed.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.040
The two daughters we have...

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:25.400
But,

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.680
I think Zhang Ran

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.120
is better

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:29.600
than Lu Xinying.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.240
She's more mature.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:33.600
Aiying,

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.680
you have to do me a favor.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.920
Please talk to Zhang Ran for me.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.240
Get her

00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.720
to sort things out

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.640
with Lu Xinying.

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.600
They are easier to communicate with.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.920
I just can't figure out

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.720
what Lu Xinying

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:48.080
is thinking right now.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.600
Fine.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.720
I'm feeling really anxious.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:53.840
Let me tell you.

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:55.840
Look at this.

00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:58.360
See?

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.320
Look at all this hair falling out.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.160
Fine.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.560
Just stop worrying about it.

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:04.240
I haven't been sleeping at all.

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.880
But you not sleeping won't help.

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.040
Alright,

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.400
I'll have Zhang Ran talk to her.

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:12.640
Let's see what she's really thinking.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.240
You know you mom sent me here.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.880
I figured.

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.800
Have some coffee.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.440
I don't usually drink coffee.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.800
I can't sleep if I drink it.

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.280
Oh, you don't drink coffee.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.840
I... I don't know.

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:49.880
It's fine.

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.680
Wrong place.

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.160
Our relationship

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.000
isn't very close.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.920
It's really beautiful here.

00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.680
Sitting for a while is quite nice.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.240
Xinying...

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.040
I...

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.560
I actually feel quite guilty towards you.

00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.840
After being in Canada for so long,

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.360
I haven't really looked after you much.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.280
And I'm not trying to make excuses

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.160
for myself.

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.640
I actually

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.480
couldn't really help much at the time.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:27.880
You're overthinking it, Ran.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:29.640
I have

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.640
no idea why,

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.600
but I just woke up

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:32.960
in Canada.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.840
I don't like it there either.

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:38.040
My mom just thinks

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.600
staying in Canada

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.280
is a success in itself.

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.840
That way, she herself would be successful.

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.840
I just wanted to make her happy,

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:48.560
so I did many things

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:50.520
that I never liked doing,

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.440
that I never wanted to do.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.400
Then I thought

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.360
I should live for myself this life.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:00.400
Ran, are you doing okay over there?

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.520
Back then,

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.680
why did you want to go to Canada?

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:04.000
I...

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:07.320
I guess because of my dream.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.400
I majored in English, right?

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:10.880
Back then,

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.680
I was doing pretty well.

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:13.520
I became a host.

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.760
I felt like

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.560
all the doors

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:17.800
were open to me.

00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:18.440
I just thought

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.080
what if I could go abroad?

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.160
I just gave it a try.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.760
You know sometimes

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:23.760
the choices people make...

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:25.880
When you have to choose a path,

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.920
you get this feeling.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.480
You feel like

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.840
this path was laid just for you.

00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:31.520
And you just went for it

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:32.280
without a second thought.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.640
But, after all the twists

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:36.760
and turns,

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.480
you realize

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.760
that sometimes what you lose

00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:42.440
might be far more

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.360
than what you gain.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:51.560
Right.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:53.800
Well,

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.640
I wound up

00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.840
back here anyway.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.040
Actually, when I was little,

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.000
my mother had high hopes for me.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.240
Making me learn this and that.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.600
But after I grew up,

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.960
I didn't meet their expectations.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.120
I failed.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.480
I embarrassed her.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.960
This is my mother's value system.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:13.800
This is just how my mother is.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.280
She thinks that's the only version of me

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.400
that qualifies as success.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.320
It's been like this since I was a child.

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:22.440
We are completely at odds with each other.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.080
Are you low-key talking about me?

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:29.480
Is there a possibility that

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.400
her original intention

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.440
was actually for your own good?

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:34.560
Of course, there's a generation gap.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:36.840
People from their era

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.000
do believe it's for your benefit.

00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:41.960
But from my own reflection,

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.120
I think in this life

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.120
you should do the things you want to do

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.640
with all your might.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.920
Give it one last push.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.120
If it doesn't work out, forget it.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.800
Ran, how's your push going?

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.520
I'm being a clown right now.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.440
Didn't you watch my livestream?

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.000
I did.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.240
I don't think you're a clown.

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.960
I believe

00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.520
hard work pays off.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:15.720
And you?

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.680
What exactly are you doing now?

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.680
I'm at a study abroad agency.

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:24.920
Sales?

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:25.600
That's right.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.560
Sales is pretty tough.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.800
But I chose it myself.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.200
[It's been years]

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.600
[since we had]

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:54.280
[a meal together.]

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.640
Welcome home, Xinying.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.480
Come on.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.560
Let's eat.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.120
Here.

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:13.760
Thanks, Dad.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:15.800
Here.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.000
Let me say a few words.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.720
Ying, you're grown up now.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.440
Actually, Mom has been thinking

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.080
about these words for many days.

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:26.480
I want to say...

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.960
I need to adjust myself as well.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.360
I might have given you

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.120
too little encouragement before.

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.800
But everything I do

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.000
is definitely for your own good.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.200
Mom loves you most.

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:41.480
You know that, right, baby?

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.440
Dad knows me well.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.240
My bark is worse than my bite.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.920
Mom can make mistakes too.

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.400
Sometimes I might

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.160
hurt your feelings.

00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:53.840
I've thought it over carefully.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:56.360
If I do something wrong in the future,

00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:58.240
you need

00:29:58.480 --> 00:29:59.120
to tell me,

00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:00.200
okay?

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.200
And then,

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:04.160
I want to say I'm sorry.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:05.440
I'll change from now on.

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:07.560
Mom.

00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.080
Mom,

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:10.840
I'm sorry.

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.480
I shouldn't have been so willful

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.240
and argued with you.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.560
Then I shouldn't always make you angry.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.040
I'll change in the future.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:28.720
Come on, eat.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.200
Mom, hurry up.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.200
Eat this fish tofu.

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:31.280
Mom, you eat some too.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.120
Xinying, you love eating this,

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.040
but you still need to

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:34.640
cut back on spicy food.

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.360
Alright.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.160
Eat less spicy food.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:40.240
Cool down your temper.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.160
No, I'm not angry at all.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:43.960
I'm actually quite happy now.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.200
Is this not cooked properly?

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.320
Then put it back in.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.120
Raw food cools me down.

00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:53.480
Here's a cooked one for you.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.400
Okay, okay.

00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.880
Dad got a little emotional today,

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:56.800
so he can handle spicy food.

00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.280
I'm just overjoyed.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.240
Watching you two being so sentimental,

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.000
I don't even know what to say.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.280
You're just here enjoying the show.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.800
Hurry up and eat.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:06.840
Shut your mouth.

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:07.680
Alright.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.520
Here's what I'm thinking.

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.480
Now that our daughter's back...

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.080
More words?

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.240
It's good to be back.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.760
Now you can stay home every day,

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.280
eat well and sleep well,

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.720
then call up your friends

00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:21.440
and head out,

00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.680
hit some restaurants,

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.800
watch a movie

00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:24.920
and just relax.

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.640
Then if you have anything to say,

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:28.120
you can talk to me anytime.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.200
We'll sort things out together

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.400
after you return to Canada

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.240
about how to move forward in the future.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.280
For example,

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.000
if you tell me

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.200
you don't want to work at the bank,

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.080
I think that's fine too.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.240
We don't necessarily have to

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:43.880
work at a bank.

00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:45.680
just because we studied finance.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.160
Let's say, if you want to continue your studies

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.240
and take the postgraduate exam,

00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:52.520
we will support you.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.000
Yes.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:53.960
You won't feel any pressure.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.000
Why don't you eat something first?

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.880
All you think about is eating.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.200
Can you stop interrupting me?

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.040
And you've grown up now.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.280
If you told me,

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:04.840
"Mom, I want to get married.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.760
I want to be in a relationship."

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.600
What's going on here?

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:07.960
I'm an open-minded mom.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:09.400
What are you up to today?

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:10.840
I'm a woman too.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.560
I've been your age before.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:13.840
I can share the lessons

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:14.920
I learned

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.720
with you.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.920
Wait, what lessons?

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.200
The lessons I learned from you.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.160
You have no self-awareness.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:26.080
Listen, Xinying.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.040
Listen to me.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.400
No matter what,

00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:29.160
you need to find someone locally

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.640
who's respectable

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.280
with status and position

00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:35.240
and at least has a stable income.

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:36.680
Where are you even going with this?

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.600
You own a place over there.

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.320
So if you marry into that family,

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.920
you can stand tall.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.360
Of course,

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.520
you can have your own thoughts too.

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.520
Just tell me.

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.680
I'll try to see things from your perspective,

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.200
okay?

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.520
What do you think?

00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.880
My work visa

00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:00.240
has run into some issues.

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.280
The visa issue is nothing.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:04.080
Just a

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.520
man-made problem.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.560
I'll handle it for you.

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.720
I'll smoothly

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:09.880
send you back.

00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:12.600
Mom,

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.120
this isn't that simple.

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.400
When my work visa was about to expire,

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.240
my job was gone.

00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:18.840
So, to transfer my immigration status,

00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.040
I hired a lawyer,

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:21.080
and I got a personal guarantee,

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:23.080
which was somewhat illegal to begin with.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.760
Then the guarantor ran into trouble

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:26.560
and I got put on

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:27.960
the list of untrustworthy individuals.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:28.720
So,

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.440
I'm being deported immediately

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.040
and can never go back to Canada again.

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.480
So I can only stay

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:35.080
in the country.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.080
But look,

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.560
I haven't been slacking off here.

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.160
I found a job

00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:41.360
and I support myself.

00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.520
It's been quite fulfilling.

00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.880
We can still get together often,

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:44.640
right?

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.040
Did you know about this?

00:33:53.480 --> 00:33:54.000
No.

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:55.960
Why didn't

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.600
you tell me before?

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.200
Something this big,

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.080
why didn't you let me know?

00:33:58.880 --> 00:33:59.560
Dad, listen.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.480
It's pointless.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.400
It's already happened.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.280
It's already the result now.

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.679
Acting, huh?

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.000
You old liar.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.920
You little liar.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.639
You two teamed up to deceive me,

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:17.159
Right?

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:19.000
What did I lie to you about?

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.199
Haven't you lied to me enough?

00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.239
About her coming back,

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:22.159
I did keep it from you.

00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:24.000
But the fact that she can't go back,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.199
I just found out about it myself.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:25.800
Let me tell you something.

00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:26.360
You, in my eyes

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.560
have absolutely no credibility.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:28.719
As for your job,

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:30.000
have you ever told me the truth?

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:31.360
Oh no.

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:32.480
So this isn't over?

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:33.159
Didn't I already

00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:34.360
explain this to you before?

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:35.679
I told you

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:36.480
that's because I was afraid you'd worry.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.280
That's why I didn't tell you.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.600
Do you think I'm not upset

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.840
about losing my job?

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.199
I wanted to talk to someone about it too.

00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:43.080
Who could I even talk to?

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.199
You go find someone to talk to.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:45.320
I didn't.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:45.679
I'm just...

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:47.080
I can only talk to my car.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:47.600
I make money

00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.880
to fill that hole.

00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:49.840
But the wound inside me

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.960
remains unhealed.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.520
You know who can fix it.

00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:55.679
Is this ever going to end?

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:58.160
Are you going to bring this up forever?

00:34:58.280 --> 00:34:58.560
Dad.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.000
Why do you always mention this?

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.160
So angry now?

00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:04.040
Can you two stop fighting?

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:04.920
Dad, Mom.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:06.720
I never would have thought,

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.080
after all these years away,

00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:10.200
our family would end up like this.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.880
How could you two

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:12.920
end up fighting like this?

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:13.880
Just think about

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.600
what's most important

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.000
in our family?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:16.960
I'll take responsibility

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.120
for myself.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.960
[Back when I was in Canada,]

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.960
[I waited day and night]

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.360
longing to return home

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.720
to have a meal with my family.

00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:28.960
I never imagined

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:30.800
the meal I dreamed of

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.560
would end

00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.000
with my family falling apart.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.600
Don't be too sad about it.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:43.760
To be honest,

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.840
just leave it

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.360
for them to solve.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.560
There's no use worrying about it.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.280
When I was little,

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.120
no matter how strict my mom was,

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:57.800
making me practice the piano

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:59.000
day and night,

00:36:00.560 --> 00:36:01.920
even making me do homework,

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.200
I always knew

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.000
she did it for my own good.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.280
I never doubted that.

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.240
How could

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.880
our life

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:18.480
become so unhappy?

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.160
I suddenly felt

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.880
that even family,

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.280
the closest of bonds,

00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:31.280
can change.

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.960
I used to look forward to growing up.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:36.080
Thinking back, it was so foolish.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.840
[Now that I've grown up, I have to rely on myself.]

00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.360
[But,]

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.200
[when I can only rely on myself,]

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.600
[it really hurts.]

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.760
Have you lost weight?

00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.840
Yang, I'm right here.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.200
Yang, looks like you're starving.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:05.520
You haven't been in much

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.680
so you're not used to it.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.520
Enough talk.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:11.880
Where's the food I told you to prepare?

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:12.800
Serve it up for Yang.

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:19.000
See?

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.800
We haven't forgotten you.

00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:22.400
Eat this piece of tofu.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.200
From now on, we'll all

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.360
live with a clear conscience.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.520
Eat it.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.400
We stick together.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.760
I'm giving you a way out.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.240
You should

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.160
stop doing designated driver.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.400
From now on, work for me.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.560
Be my personal driver.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.120
You won't lose out.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.840
I keep my word.

00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:51.920
Seeing how pitiful you are,

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.520
we are giving you some money.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:55.320
Spend it for now.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.520
We'll leave it all here.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.640
Just a token of our goodwill.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.040
How can you just get up and leave?

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.400
Are you still working as my driver or not?

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:34.760
Pay the bill.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.480
[So now,]

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.080
[your biggest life goal]

00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.200
[is to throw a stone]

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:34.800
and make it skip seven times?

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.560
Don't you think that phrase

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.120
sounds philosophical

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.440
coming from you?

00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.720
Let me ask you a question.

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.560
When your play is over,

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.680
what are you planning to do?

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:01.080
Truth or Dare.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.200
Whoever wins gets to ask.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:04.040
Come on.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.240
Rock, paper, scissors.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.640
I'm planning to buy a small asteroid.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.800
Why don't you buy the moon?

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.720
I actually bought an asteroid,

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:16.560
named after me.

00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:34.240
I thought you were dead.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:38.560
I almost died.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.520
[Kuang Dazhi's personal guarantee]

00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.400
[has a problem.]

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.480
My work visa is invalid.

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:47.840
I'm sorry.

00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:51.480
It's okay. It's all in the past.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.120
It was just my bad luck.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.840
It wasn't your bad luck.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.400
Maybe my misfortune

00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:58.960
was passed on to you.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.320
I was just thinking I'd die.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.640
What can be filled on that form

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.320
And who would be

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.360
the one to help me fill it out?

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.000
I'll help you collect your debt.

00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.680
You still dare to help me?

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:25.560
Of course.
