WEBVTT

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.559
According to the third rule of our agreement,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.960
you took advantage of me.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.879
You need to pay extra.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.359
Who took advantage of you?

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.359
That was an accident.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.560
You tried to snatch my files.

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:35.119
So accidents don't count as violations?

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:36.399
Then you better be careful.

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:38.240
You might have a lot of "accidents" in the future.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.039
Don't you dare.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.479
If you break the rules,

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.039
I'll dock all your salary.

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:44.520
Oh.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.079
When you break the rules, it's an accident.

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:47.600
But when I do, I get fined.

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:49.159
You're really committed to the contract.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:51.960
How much do you want?

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:53.399
One kiss, one thousand yuan.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:54.439
No credit.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.920
One thousand yuan?

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:05.319
Don't bring this up again.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.040
Thank you for your patronage, boss.

00:01:10.519 --> 00:01:11.519
Friendly reminder:

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.239
Bulk purchases come with more discounts.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.560
Shut up.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:20.239
Go back to your room and sleep.

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:26.120
Boss,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.680
I've finished checking the information you wanted.

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:28.760
Qingmu Technology

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.439
has actually been running quite well.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.239
It should have been making a profit.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.040
But Su Qingyan's fourth uncle, Su Zhengdong,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.319
colluded with outside companies

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.079
and maliciously delayed company payments.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.120
He pocketed the money for himself.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.840
This caused financial trouble for Qingmu Technology.

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.280
I'll send you the details later.

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.719
Looks like I need to have a talk with Su Zhengdong.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.840
Sixty million in two days.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.640
What are we supposed to do with so much money?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.280
Qingyan, have you come up with a solution?

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.359
The company is owed over twenty million in receivables.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.240
If we can recover all of it,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.039
plus the ten million you plan to invest in Qingmu,

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.159
that would solve half the problem.

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.840
Qingmu's finances have always been controlled by your fourth uncle.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.560
He definitely won't cooperate if you ask for money.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.639
We can't just sit here and do nothing.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.000
Let's go.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.680
Go find him.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.840
President Su.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.919
Don't do this.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.560
Don't let anyone see us.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:29.879
What are you afraid of?

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.639
I'm the one in charge of this company.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.159
Baby.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.759
We shouldn't be afraid of anything.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.319
Don't stop.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.319
Keep going.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.840
I haven't seen enough yet.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:47.840
Who are you?

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.080
Who let you in?

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.319
I'm the vice president of Qingmu.

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:52.240
Of course I should be sitting in the vice president's office.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.520
You're lying.

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:55.400
I'm the only vice president at Qingmu.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.719
That's me, Su Zhengdong.

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.039
Su Qingyan's real uncle.

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:59.840
Who do you think you are?

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.280
So what if you're her real uncle?

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:03.719
I'm Su Qingyan's real husband.

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.080
Real husband.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.680
So you're the delivery guy.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:12.120
What,

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.639
can't keep pretending to be the CEO anymore?

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.840
Now you're here to steal my position as vice president?

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.840
Keep dreaming.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.919
Get out of here.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.759
Get out!

00:03:18.759 --> 00:03:19.479
Did you hear me?

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.800
Why are you here?

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800
If you don't leave, I'll have to use force.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.000
I'm here to take office, honey.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.280
Didn't we agree that I'd be the vice president?

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.560
When did I ever agree to that?

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.759
Well, Su Qingyan,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.199
I've worked at this company for so many years,

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:35.439
working hard and diligently.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.280
And you let this loser take my vice president position?

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.919
Do you have any conscience at all?

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:41.159
I can vouch for that.

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.159
Vice President Su was just now

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:44.439
working very hard with the female secretary.

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:45.360
He was really putting in the effort.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.719
Shut up!

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:48.240
That's slander!

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:49.840
I'm a dignified vice president.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.960
How could I possibly do

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.639
something so despicable?

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.039
Wow, you're even insulting yourself.

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:56.759
You're really ruthless.

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.280
Enough, all of you, stop arguing.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.080
Let's start the meeting first.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:15.400
I...

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.000
Uncle Si,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.920
several large accounts receivable for the company

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.160
have been overdue for a long time.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:30.519
You must find a solution today

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.759
and get the money back for me.

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:33.399
We can't get this money back.

00:04:33.399 --> 00:04:34.519
I'm anxious too.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.439
I've already urged them several times.

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:37.839
They're just stalling and won't pay.

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.879
What can I do?

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.879
You've always been in charge of purchasing and sales.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.519
You were the one who found these clients.

00:04:43.519 --> 00:04:45.639
You can't just say there's nothing you can do and leave it at that.

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.680
It's not like you don't know

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:50.079
how complicated those companies' backgrounds are.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.680
Each one is harder to deal with than the last.

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.680
We can't afford to offend them.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.399
You can't even collect the debts.

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.279
How can you call yourself a deputy general manager?

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.560
Shut your mouth.

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.120
Idiot, what do you know?

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.360
Qingyan.

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:05.560
Doesn't he keep saying he wants to be deputy general manager?

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.279
Let him go collect the money.

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:08.279
I can do it.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.279
If I manage to get the money back,

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:11.040
what will you say then?

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.439
If you can get it back,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.839
I'll let you be the deputy general manager right away.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.560
Where are you going?

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:24.839
I'm going to collect a debt.

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:25.720
You can't go.

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:28.040
Why not?

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.160
The two companies that owe us money

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:31.480
One is called Sanhe.

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:32.639
The other is called Jinzun.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.800
Sanhe is involved in shady business.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.480
They have dozens of desperate men working for them.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.279
They have a notorious reputation.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.160
You can't afford to offend them.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.279
Jinzun's boss's father has even more powerful connections.

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.439
No one dares to mess with him.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.360
If you go after them for money,

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.079
you might go in standing and come out carried.

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:47.879
Really?

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:51.920
But I have to become the deputy general manager.

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:53.240
What else can I do?

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.040
Don't do anything reckless.

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:57.360
If you get into trouble, I can't protect you.

00:06:12.079 --> 00:06:12.879
Kid.

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:15.759
Kid.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.720
This is the debt contract from Sanhe.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.560
Aren't you so capable?

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:22.839
If you have what it takes, get the money back.

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:26.040
Then this position will be yours.

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:31.000
Pack up your things.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.720
Get ready to move.

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:46.920
Young Master Song.

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.959
That kid really took the bait.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.639
He's gone to Sanhe to collect the debt.

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:53.680
Did you inform Sanhe's boss Zhao Daqiang?

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:54.480
Of course.

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:55.839
Everything's been arranged.

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:57.680
Break both his legs.

00:06:58.319 --> 00:06:59.519
Make him crawl out.

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.519
Good.

00:07:06.399 --> 00:07:07.360
Hey, Gao.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:09.000
Aren't you supposed to be tough?

00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:10.160
This time,

00:07:10.519 --> 00:07:12.639
I want to see how many you can take on.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.040
Qingyan

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.279
Something's wrong.

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:25.319
Your fake husband really went to Sanhe Company to collect the debt.

00:07:25.319 --> 00:07:26.120
What?

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:27.839
That idiot.

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:30.079
Sanhe Company has always been ruthless.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.160
Let's go check it out.

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:35.439
Pair.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.439
Don't play.

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:38.319
Pung.

00:07:39.399 --> 00:07:40.079
Two kings.

00:07:40.079 --> 00:07:40.879
Can you handle it?

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.240
Pass.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.079
Follow.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.920
Hurry up.

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:45.319
Come on, play your card.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:46.639
What kind of card is that?

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:47.720
Pass, pass, I don't want it.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.040
Are you playing or not? Give me a beer.

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:50.839
Zhao Daqiang, is President Zhao here?

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:52.639
Who are you?

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.439
I'm from Qingmu Company.

00:07:54.639 --> 00:07:56.519
Your company’s six million debt to us is due.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.480
I'm here to collect.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.639
No money.

00:08:02.839 --> 00:08:03.480
Get lost.

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:09.240
Paying back debts is only right.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.879
Oh, come on.

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.720
You don't understand human language, do you?

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:16.519
Do you know what kind of status I have in Yuncheng?

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.680
No, I don't.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:19.439
I only know

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:21.560
that your six million debt to us is in black and white.

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:22.959
Crystal clear.

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:27.920
Interesting.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.680
Guys,

00:08:29.879 --> 00:08:30.600
stop playing.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.279
Kid

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:39.919
Today I'll show you

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:41.759
what happens when you try to collect a debt from me, Zhao Daqiang

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.080
and how miserable your end will be

00:09:21.399 --> 00:09:22.480
It's just up ahead.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.000
Let's go.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.399
This...

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.720
Have all the bodies been destroyed to cover up the evidence?

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:40.679
Call the police right away.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.080
I hope he's okay.

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.320
Why are you here?

00:09:46.679 --> 00:09:47.480
I'm glad.
