Hello. I'd like to see Mr. Song.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.120
Do you have an appointment?

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.560
Thank you.

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:19.520
This is my fifth time coming here.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.479
I want to know when Mr. Song can see me.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.520
I'm sorry. Mr. Song has left the office.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:27.120
What?

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.159
Mr. Song, you promised
to spend tonight with me.

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:35.479
No. You promised to stay with me.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.159
That depends on your performance.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.080
Sir.

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.680
Miss Gu comes looking for you every day.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:44.879
Won't you see her?

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.039
Plenty of people
want to see me every day.

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:50.080
Just send her away.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.319
If I'm a representative
of Grace Hospital,

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.280
will you see me?

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.439
Mr. Song.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.560
Miss Gu.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.560
I never expected

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.680
you'd actually track me down here.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.639
I just want to verify some things
with you.

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.759
Are you avoiding me?

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.319
I don't even know you.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:14.919
Why should I meet you?

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.680
But you must know my hospital's dean.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.959
He made the last call to you
before his death.

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:25.120
Are you suspecting me?

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.120
I just want to know
what the dean told you.

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:50.160
The Wei Group has always collaborated
with hospitals.

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:51.439
It was normal contact.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.360
Anything wrong with that?

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.959
Wait.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
Mr. Song,
have you ever been to Tai City?

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.160
No.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.120
Six months ago, I was in Tai City

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.759
and met some drug dealers.

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.439
There was a man among them
who looked exactly like you.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.319
He risked his life to save me.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.680
I just want to know
if you and he could be...

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.000
Could be the same person?

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.720
Miss Gu,

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:30.319
are you implying I'm a drug dealer?

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.720
Do you realize what you're saying?

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.120
That's not what I meant.

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:39.240
Then what did you mean?

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.839
Many people try to get close to me.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.720
But using this kind of approach,

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:47.480
you're the first.

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:51.920
I just want to know

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.319
if he's still alive.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.399
Fine.

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.040
I have a question.

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:03.920
What exactly
is your relationship with him?

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.399
He's

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.480
a friend I'm not very close to.

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:15.040
A friend you're not very close to

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.399
is worth all your concern?

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.519
Miss Gu,

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:21.040

I don't care
what your relationship with him is.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.680

Third,

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:46.839
I've never saved anyone.

Or I'll have you thrown out.

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:26.480
Mr. Song, I know I offended you earlier.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.600

Miss Gu,

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:27.720
I never expected
your hands that save patients

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.199
could be so efficient
at undoing a man's buttons.

00:08:31.279 --> 00:08:33.799

Not at all.

I'm okay with that.

Miss Gu, I'm not used
to your hard-to-get act.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.840
Next time, just state
your consultation fee upfront.

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:51.279
I prefer clear prices.

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:52.480
You're indeed not him.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.200
At least he'd never insult me like this.

00:11:15.519 --> 00:11:16.360
Why did you hit me?

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.720
Some woman
has been harassing Qian lately.

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:19.919

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.840

my fiancee.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.519
Fiancee?

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.279
I've seen plenty of women like you.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.080
You throw yourself
at any rich, handsome guy you see.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.919
You have no manners at all.

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:40.840
My manners prevent me
from hitting people casually.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.679
You should've slapped Mr. Song,

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:44.919
instead of me.

00:11:45.279 --> 00:11:47.519
Also, I suggest you
check into my emergency department.

00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:50.399
You've got Stage 2
or higher retinal degeneration.

00:11:51.879 --> 00:11:53.080
What do you mean?

00:11:53.279 --> 00:11:54.639
It's known as blindness.
