00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.620
Isn't it odd?

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.810
We've been living with Master all this while

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.300
and we never knew he knew martial arts.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.730
Everyone has their secrets.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.050
We didn't tell him

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.580
about the Green Vial either.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.810
He treats you like his own son.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.210
Why are you doubting him?

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.770
I've been practicing

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.740
Mammoth Skin for a long time.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.490
I was punched. I was in pain.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.850
And I never complain.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.530
That's different.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.130
He killed someone.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.300
Wu Yan was in the Wild Wolves Gang.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.410
He betrayed Seven Mysteries Sect.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.130
He deserves death.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.900
Besides, Master did it to save you.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.050
That doesn't even make sense.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.500
Am I that important?

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:19.900
Of course.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.730
Master has reserved the best for you.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.860
He taught you how to heal and how to read.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.650
He's nice to you.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.330
It's raining.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:31.300

Zhang Tie!

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.490
Did I overthink it?

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.460
Are you leaving the mountain for real?

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.690
Your lack of progress

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.620
is tied to the herb's inefficiency.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.380
I have thought about it

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.410
and decided to find better herbs for you.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.620
But are you sure you're well enough to do this?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.490
I can come with you.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.380
No need.

Zhang Tie.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.570

You'll be punished if he makes no progress

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.210
Go back now.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.900

Physician Mo often left for months at a time

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.980
to search

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.290
for herbs.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.100

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.060

Senior Li.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.340
I am Han Li.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.290
Senior Li,

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:40.450
you...

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.130
Your condition puzzles me.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:44.610
I can only seal your pressure points

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.660
with my needles for the moment.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.690
Did you ingest any herbs previously?

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.730
They are...

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.660
This?

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.890
This pill is made from Helan,

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.890
Scorpion Flower,

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.100
Blue Ant Eggs, and around thirty other rare herbs.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:23.570
It is red

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:25.660
and repugnant.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.820
Once you ingest it,

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.890
even your bones will ache.

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.610
Thus, it's called Bone Agony Pill.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.850
It

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.380
brings out your potential

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:33.410
and makes you stronger.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.130
But the caveat

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.500
is that it costs your life

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:37.660
and comes with detrimental side effects.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:42.730
You should stop taking these pills.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.780
If you continue,

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.610
you'll have at most ten years left to live.

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.140
Give me a reason to spare you.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.410
I saved you.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.250
Is that not a good reason?

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.340
Truth be told,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.290
I did wonder if I would be killed

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.290
after saving you.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.540
Who would have thought

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.250
that you'd turn your back on me this soon?

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:49.930
I swear

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.780
I won't tell anyone.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.340
Your promise means nothing.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.290
Surely you know

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.340
that I'm Physician Mo's final disciple.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:01.580
That old man has many disciples.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.980
It doesn't matter if you're the final disciple or not.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:04.730
It does.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.220
I study medicine under him.

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.170
I can treat

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:10.250
your condition.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.410
That pill comes with grave side effects.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.370
You will be gripped with excruciating pain

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.580
that you wish you could die right away.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.810
I might not be able to save you

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.900
but I can alleviate your suffering.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:26.340
How?

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.930
With your blade on my neck,

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.140
I can't think properly.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.290
I can't recall anything.

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:49.830
Han Li,

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.580
I apologize for my conduct.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.540
You saved me today

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:55.700
and swore to keep this a secret.

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:57.490
I owe you one.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:01.810
The medicine

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.100
will be ready in three days.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:04.810
We'll meet here.

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:06.780
Deal.

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.170
It's a promise.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.580
I almost got myself killed.

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:19.900
I won't intervene as readily anymore.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.580
Still,

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:25.610
Li Feiyu said Master

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.610
had many disciples.

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:29.950
Why have I never seen anyone else here?

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:39.490
Zhang Tie.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:40.780
You're back.

00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:41.290
I...

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.460
Why are you sweating so much?

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.490
I ran back for the food.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.980
The food is ready.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.340
What are we having today?

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:51.490
Water dropwort broth and black rice.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.580
As usual.

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:18.770
You're awake.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.370
You sat here for one whole day.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:24.060
Did you know that?

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.180
You've been sitting here since last morning

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:27.890
when I left to gather wood.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.220
When I came back for lunch,

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:29.820
you were still here.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.180
I slept.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.300
And when I woke up, you were still here.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:33.530
You were like a statue.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.650
If I hadn't checked your breathing,

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.370
I would have thought you were dead.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:42.100
That long?

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.180
I reheated

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.890
the food several times.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:47.300
I don't lie.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.530
Time flies.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:08.460
I merely had a dream.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.100
I think Master is back.

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.100
Let me see.

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:16.770
One whole day

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.340
without food.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:21.980
Why am I not hungry?

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.130
Is it because of the mantra?

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:31.940
They say only immortals don't get hungry.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.730
Han Li!

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.370

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.010
Han Li!

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.530
Master is dying!

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:43.770
Quick.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:45.650
I can't heal.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.340
Master...

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:47.820
Master is dying!

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:49.220
Master!

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:50.130
Master!

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:51.770
Hurry up!

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:57.460
Han Li!

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.890
Quick!

00:11:58.910 --> 00:11:59.370
Get me some water.

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:01.940
Master.

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.610
Caihuai,

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.250
is that you?

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:07.010
Master,

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:07.530
it's me.

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:08.530
I'm Han Li.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:10.460
You'll be fine.

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.220
You'll be fine.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:11.700
I...

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.300
You just have to take some medicine.

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.060
I...

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:14.580
Master.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.200
Han Li.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:15.940
I'm here.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.820
- Han Li. - I'm here.

00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.770
I'm here.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:25.060
Master,

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:25.940
you're hurting me.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.340
Oh, my.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.420
You have ascended to Tier 3 of the Longevity Art.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.120
[Longevity Art, Tier 3]

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:40.980
I didn't know that.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.340
When I was training,

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.420
something got into me.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:45.460
I had a dream.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:46.940
In that dream,

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:49.250
there was a vortex on my tummy

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.460
that could absorb spiritual aura from my surroundings.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:53.370
That's

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.490
Tier 3?

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.180
My child,

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.610
that is not a dream.

00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:58.660
Zhang Tie!

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:00.130
Go

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.300
to the herb cabinet.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.250
Third row,

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.100
second column from the left.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.130
There's a white vial inside a small box.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.100
Bring it to me.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:08.340
Yes!

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:12.940
That's not a dream.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.130
That's not a dream.

00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:15.100
My child,

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.890
the day has come.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.250
I'm so happy.

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.700
That's meditation.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:20.130
That's inner eye.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.820
My hard work has paid off.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.610
The day has...

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:29.610
Great.

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.890
Bone Agony Pill?

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.100
Even Li Feiyu knows

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:47.610
how detrimental it can be.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:49.610
Surely Master knows too.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.250
Master.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.820
My disciple.

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.940
My beloved disciple.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.460
Han Li.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.010
My hard work has paid off.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.100
It has paid off.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.650
The greed in his eyes

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:32.940
is unsettling.

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:34.340
It's as if

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.010
he's not looking at a human being,

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.220
but an object.

00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:54.420
You sure are punctual, Han Li.

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:56.100
The hour of Wu three days later.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.130
It is precisely the hour of Wu now.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.340
This will last for a month.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.220
That's all?

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:06.680
I

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.180
have run out of herbs.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:09.890
I need time to gather the rest.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:12.940
So be it.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.010
Thank you, Han Li.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.940
What is the meaning of this?

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:22.700
This concoction

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:23.980
uses rhinoceros horns as base.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.700
I won't count the other costs.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.460
Just give me two taels.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.300
Can I pay you next month?

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.980
If you don't have money,

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.250
you can give me something else.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:36.130
You do

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:37.700
have a fancy blade.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:39.980
Not this blade.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.730
What about a favor then?

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.890
A favor again.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.730
If you need help, come to me.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:47.890
I'll

00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.820
help you.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.220
Why

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.650
are you taking the pills?

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.610
You need an edge if you want a place

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:06.180
in the martial arts world.

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:09.060
I used to think that life is short.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.060
I would rather fight for the present and not for a legacy.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.010
The pills can give me what I want.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:15.220
My health is a worthy sacrifice.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.890
But now, I...

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.250
Well, forget it.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.770
Thank you for the concoction.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.610
See you next month.

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.530
Fight for the present

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:30.730
and not for a legacy.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.770
What does Master want then?

00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.890
Master!

00:16:50.910 --> 00:16:51.490
The pot is here.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.100
Master,

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:54.730
I spent the whole afternoon

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.130
looking for a pot.

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.890
They said no need to return it to them this soon.

00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:59.220
Just return it to them once we're done.

00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.980
Master,

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:01.820
let me cook

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.130
some of your favorite tofus.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.250
Sure.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:09.370
You're so thoughtful, Zhang Tie.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.180
Why don't the three of us

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:13.890
have a toast together?

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:16.220
Sure.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:20.220
Master,

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.340
take care of your health.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.530
Just one sip.

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:25.890
It won't kill me.

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:30.610
Let me fill the bowl for Master.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.010
Then, for Han Li.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.180
I'll have one too.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:39.580
On behalf of Zhang Tie and me,

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.820
we raise our bowls

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.650
to wish Master a life of longevity.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:43.580
May you live

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:44.980
to one hundred years old.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.420
One hundred years old?

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.700
I'm happy to see another day.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.250
Master.

00:18:01.030 --> 00:18:01.530
Come.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:02.820
Master.

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.100
Allow me to say a toast.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:06.490
It's my fourth year here in the valley.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:08.010
You taught me Mammoth Skin

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.980
and many things.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.060
You even allowed me to clear my debt.

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:13.010
I...

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.100
I'm not good with words.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.850
Let this toast speak for itself.

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:34.250
Why do I feel dizzy?

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.890
Master.

00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:38.010
Excuse him.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.180
Bring him back.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.380
I'm sick of coddling him

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:44.980
like a child.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.050
Let's go.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:46.860
Master,

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:47.490
I'll be back soon.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.380
Where is Master?

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:51.010
Master.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:14.770
If you don't see me

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.220
tomorrow morning,

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:17.940
[If you don't see me...]
leave the mountain at once.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.530
Do not return.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.420
Zhang Tie.

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:28.810
Zhang Tie.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.980
Master.

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:24.620
Today,

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:26.380
you

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.700
will read my pulse.

00:20:53.590 --> 00:20:54.810
Your pulse is disorderly,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.140
as if there are two qis circulating in your body.

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.660
Wherever they go,

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:02.730
they damage your Meridian system.

00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:06.420
If I may comment,

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.570
based on your pulse,

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.810
you...

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.380
My days are numbered

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.660
unless I find a cure.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.810
I know

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.220
better than you

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.860
how fragile my health is.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.290
Come, my child.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.290
On this special occasion,

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.490
I am delighted to know

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.330
that you've made progress.

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.140
Hence,

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:48.460
I

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.140
would like

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.810
to be honest with you.

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.940
Time waits for no one.

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.980
Black hair can turn into white in an instant.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:15.010
Guess how old I am.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.490
Around

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:18.980
sixty

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.010
or seventy years old.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:32.820
[Thirty]

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.940
[Thirty Seven]

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.810
37 after the new year.

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:53.050
You don't trust me?

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.050
Well,

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.660
you can ask the third uncle

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.660
of that outer disciple of Seven Mysteries Sect.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:02.380
He must have heard

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.490
of Wondrous Hands,

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:06.700
Mo Juren of Lanzhou.

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:13.940
I am

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.180
Mo Juren.

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.730
Back then,

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.660
I was as young as you.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.620
There was no ailment

00:23:25.730 --> 00:23:27.340
I couldn't cure

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.770
and no toxin I couldn't remove.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:31.860
Alas,

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:34.810
I can save everyone else

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.620
but me.

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.420
I was hurt by despicable beings.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.460
My knowledge

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.330
keeps me alive.

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:54.530
But this broken body

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.330
can never recover!

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.660
Master,

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.770
you need to stop taking Bone Agony Pills.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:16.250
It makes you feel better immediately

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:18.490
but it can never cure your condition.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:24.810
If you continue taking it,

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.620
you...

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.090
I know.

00:24:28.790 --> 00:24:29.460
The pills

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.730
can only give me one more year.

00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:34.090
But the heavens are on my side.

00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:36.490
I have found

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.010
a cure.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.530
Which is?

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.090
You.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:42.220
Me?

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:43.730
Only you

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.660
can save me.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:51.460
I've raised you for so long.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.220
It's time for you to return the favor!

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.570
Calm down.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.530
Calm down.

00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:07.250
Calm down.

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:11.860
Han Li.

00:25:13.550 --> 00:25:16.010
You've been asking me

00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:18.700
what the purpose of the mantra is.

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:21.980
I'll give you the answer now.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:26.770
In effect,

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.940
I need

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.570
the qi of a Tier 4 cultivator

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.460
using that mantra

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.860
to stimulate my hidden pressure points.

00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.980
That

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:36.420
will cure my condition.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.980
Not only will it remove the toxin in me,

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:40.380
it also

00:25:41.030 --> 00:25:43.220
restores my youth.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.330
That's why you picked me.

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:51.700
Is that so?

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:53.770
Not me.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.380
That mantra picked you.

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.730
Only the fated ones

00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:02.730
can cultivate the mantra.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.730
Even I cannot.

00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:07.530
Before you came,

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.420
I had tens of disciples.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.290
None of them was as fortunate as you.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.220
Had you not appeared,

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:17.900
I would have

00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.700
accepted my demise.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:23.290
Everyone dies eventually.

00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.770
But we crossed paths.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:31.090
I will seize

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:33.290
this second chance at life.

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:35.180
Anyone else would have done the same.

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:37.050
So,

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.490
cure my condition

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.090
and you

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:42.460
can have everything in this valley.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.900
What is it?

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.140
You agreed to everything when you asked to be my disciple.

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:52.530
You're regretting it now?

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:55.460
I will not

00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:58.250
lie or betray you.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.010
But why

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:06.460
have you never told me about this?

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.010
You have read many scrolls in the past.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.980
Let me teach you

00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.900
a few more.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.140
Hide cleverness with clumsiness.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.940
Do good with discretion.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.700
Stay pure in this world of darkness.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.700
Treat concession as a way to advance.

00:27:31.070 --> 00:27:33.980
That's my motto.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.460
There are certain things

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:40.940
that if I

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.730
tell you upfront,

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.900
you won't stay here loyally like you do now.

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.530
And if I fail to ascend to Tier 4?

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:18.330
You know how hard

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:20.570
it is to cultivate.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.460
It took me two years to get

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:25.660
from Tier 2 to Tier 3.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:28.730
And I'm stagnating now.

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.490
Getting to Tier 4 in a year is harder

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.010
than being an immortal.

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.980
Enough.

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:38.140
Do you think we're negotiating now?

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:41.530
Continue cultivating as usual.

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.810
I'll find those precious herbs for you.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:46.980
And don't mention

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:48.570
this again.

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.940
Like I said,

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.330
get to Tier 4

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:55.570
within a year.

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:42.290
Hide cleverness with clumsiness.

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.420
Do good with discretion.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.050
Stay pure in this world of darkness.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.250
Treat concession as a way to advance.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.940
That's my motto.

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:57.380
Zhang Tie.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.180
- Wake up. - The dumpling is delicious.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:02.730
That's all

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:04.250
you ever think of.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.050
I finally

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:16.660
have the full picture now.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:18.700
I'm thinking

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:20.810
that after I get

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:23.490
to Tier 4 next year,

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:25.180
I'll cure Master's condition.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.180
Then, we leave Shenshou Valley

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.700
and open an apothecary.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.290
We'll live

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:36.380
a comfortable life.

00:30:40.350 --> 00:30:40.860
Right?

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:42.900
He has grown wary.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.010
It took me a while to reassure him last night.

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.770
It's over

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.420
if he runs away.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.900
Let me

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:51.730
take over his body

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.250
right away.

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:59.330
No!

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.180
Why not?

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.940
He's not strong enough for you to take over yet.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.220
Do you want to be like me?

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.700
Formless?

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:11.700
You don't have time to find another disciple

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:16.250
who can practice the Longevity Art.

00:32:16.510 --> 00:32:17.700
So we wait?

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:21.290
You can feel

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.730
that this body has run its course.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:27.140
You can't carry on?

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.900
But carry on you must.

00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:33.810
I am an Immortal disciple.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.620
Do you expect me

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:38.420
to die

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.180
with a mortal like you?

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:45.250
So we wait

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.140
for a year maximum.

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.490
I will take him, whether he has reached

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:52.290
Tier 4 or not.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:32:58.530
Who's there?

00:34:06.550 --> 00:34:07.220
Zhang Tie.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:10.290
Zhang Tie!

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.420
Master.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:30.140
Come in.

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:36.730
Master,

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.980
where is Zhang Tie?

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:40.530
Zhang Tie?

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.330
He didn't tell you he left the mountain?

00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.570
He left the mountain?

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.330
He asked ten taels from me and said

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:54.180
that he would leave the mountain for a while.

00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:54.900
Impossible.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.290
He always lets me know where he goes.

00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.860
I came clean to you just now.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.530
Why would I lie to you?

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:06.620
Zhang Tie never leaves without a word.

00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:09.380
And if he truly has left the mountain,

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:10.420
surely you know

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.460
where he is going.

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:13.460
If you won't tell me,

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:15.290
I'll find him myself.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.420
As expected from a Tier 3 cultivator.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:26.730
You sensed my actions.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.290
My herbs have not gone to waste.

00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.460
I just want

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:33.050
to read your pulse.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:52.380
Come,

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.780
my dear disciple.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:57.010
I want

00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.740
to speak with you.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.940
Okay?

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.340
You

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.780
have been here for a while.

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:17.490
Do you miss home?

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.570
You once told me that you missed your sister

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:23.820
from Qingniu Town.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:26.300
Master,

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:28.690
let's not beat around the bush.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:31.490
Just say

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.940
that you

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.490
need my help.

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.050
That's all.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.210
I can't do many things,

00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:40.900
but I know to be grateful.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.820
Why are you doing this to me?

00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:48.210
You are smart,

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.940
prudent,

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:51.690
and can't be controlled.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.170
But you care too much.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:58.210
And that

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:00.570
is the greatest weakness we share.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.940
This is precisely why I don't want you

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:03.860
to see Zhang Tie.

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.300
Like I said,

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:10.940
if you can save me,

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:13.210
I'll promise you a life of riches.

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:19.090
Let's have a wager.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:22.490
Let's see who dies first.

00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:23.340
Me,

00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:24.610
you,

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.170
or the ones you hold dear?

00:37:33.070 --> 00:37:33.490
Fine.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.740
I'll reach Tier 4 in a year

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.260
and cure you.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.420
Then, you tell me where Zhang Tie is.

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:43.610
Also,

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:46.090
the herbs you bring back are running out.

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:47.610
I need more.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.210
Focus on your cultivating.

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:51.130
I'll handle

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.300
the herbs for you.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:55.380
Halt!

00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:02.050
Take this.

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:37.340
Won't you ask what it is?

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.490
Why should I?

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.170
Remember

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:46.570
what you promised me today next year.

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.260
As expected,

00:39:01.150 --> 00:39:02.490
whatever bond between us

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.860
disappears after that day.

00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:06.570
It can never turn back to the way it was.

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.340
And now,

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.010
Physician Mo has dropped all pretense.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.130
He often left to gather herbs.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.610
And when he returned,

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.860
he looked weaker than before.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.650
How did it become like this?

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.460
Or perhaps,

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.740
it has always been like this.

00:39:27.590 --> 00:39:29.380
Those carefree years in the past

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.260
seemed like an illusion.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:33.690
I've tried many ways

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.570
but I failed to remove toxin he laid.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:38.610
It seems like I'll just have to attain Tier 4.

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.130
But

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.340
this is a tall order.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:46.300
Zhang Tie,

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:48.090
I will find you

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.050
wherever you are.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:54.090
Anyway, the Green Vial

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:56.380
has lain silent for a while now.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:15.780
This is

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:17.940
whatever it gets from condensing moonlight?

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.380
Can I

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:47.530
drink it?

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:52.900
Oh, no.

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.420

I have to cultivate.

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:14.900
Stop staring at me.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.050
Just leave.

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:35.490
Where did the rabbit come from?

00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:40.650
Go away already.

00:43:20.360 --> 00:43:20.740
It...

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:22.050
It exploded?

00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:23.530
That rabbit.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.980
What is in the vial?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:40.980
Poison?

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:49.980
They grow so quickly.

00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:52.900
Is it because of the liquid?

00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:15.490
If the diluted solution

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.460
has this effect,

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.340
let's try the undiluted solution.

00:44:34.030 --> 00:44:34.380
This...

00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:35.130
This is...

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.610
A normal red sage

has grown several hundred years old in an instant.

00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.860
This liquid

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:56.780
must have something to do with those mutations.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:00.170
Animals can't take it.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.740
But it can be used on herbs to speed up

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:04.260
their growth.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.170
However, there isn't a lot of liquid.

00:45:13.150 --> 00:45:15.650
It needs to absorb moonlight at night.

00:45:21.110 --> 00:45:21.860
Perhaps

00:45:22.590 --> 00:45:24.420
I can dilute it with water like

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:25.740
my previous experiment.

00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:27.780
Furthermore,

and ingest them.

This is how I can make a comeback.

Is he cultivating?

00:47:21.590 --> 00:47:23.380
Good.

00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:26.300
It seems like

[Armored Puppet]

Growing these mystic herbs

to around three hundred years old should be enough.

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:48.460
If I follow the pill recipes in the book and make them into pills,

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.690

of this unnamed mantra.

You study the art of healing.

Surely your master has taught you

00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:33.340
to use
