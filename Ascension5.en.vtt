00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.820
to visit the six other sects first.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:39.980
Then,

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.620
I'll check if they are dark cultivators and demon sects roaming about.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:43.570
I'll be back soon.

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.250
Do not forget

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:47.290
that we are to host

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.940
the next Immortal Ascension Trials.

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.220
Worry not, Nichang.

00:18:57.790 --> 00:18:58.620
Cultivators

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.180
[Tainan Valley]
rarely appear in crowded places.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:03.530
Where do they usually go?

00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:06.860
Are there truly cultivators in Tainan Valley?

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:09.730
I want to see

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.770
what they see.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.940
The valley a hundred li south of Jiayuan City

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.660
is shrouded by mists all year round.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.220
According to the scroll, Tainan Valley

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.140
should be here.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:42.420
[Wan Xiaoshan]

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.090
I am Wan Xiaoshan.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.220
How may I address you?

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.570
Han Li.

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.530
Your name is Han Li, I see.

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:57.490
You're alone here.

00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:00.140
You must be a rogue cultivator who wishes to enter Tainan Valley.

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:01.050
You know what?

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.220
Let's band up.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:03.700
Band up?

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.460
Are you perhaps lost?

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:08.970
Han,

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:10.530
don't underestimate me.

00:20:10.790 --> 00:20:11.380
Even though

00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:12.420
I'm an elementary cultivator,

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:14.420
I know very well

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:15.980
how to get to Tainan Valley.

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.660
All right, then.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:20.770
Let's travel together.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.730
Lead the way.

00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.770
Follow me.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.530
What do you mean by a rogue cultivator?

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:31.530
Like us,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.420
we do not belong to those seven sects like Moonshadow Sect

00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:36.490
or hail from a cultivator clan like the Yans.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.620
We cultivate alone

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:38.730
so we are the rogue cultivators.

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:43.420
He seems

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:45.660
to know quite a lot about cultivation.

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.660
Perhaps I can get more out of him.

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:52.570
Wan,

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:54.730
do you know of a way

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.460
to dispel the mist before us?

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:58.660
Han,

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.220
you must have only become a cultivator recently.

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:02.220
This misty barrier

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.770
only opens up once every 10 years.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:04.860
If we can't enter the valley,

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:06.700
it means it is not the right moment yet.

00:21:08.030 --> 00:21:08.530
Come.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:09.770
Have some fruit.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.090
They say

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:16.980
immortals do not eat rice.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.770
They ingest wind and pebbles and drink morning dew.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:21.940
That's not true then.

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.220
Only immortals

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.620
do that.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.250
People like us

00:21:29.310 --> 00:21:30.420
are called cultivators.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:31.700
Immortals

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.620
live as long as the universe.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:36.770
They live as long as the universe?

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.380
No wonder Physician Mo did everything to become one.

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:41.420
But considering our current cultivation progress,

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.940
we can only live a century at most.

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:45.900
That's not bad already.

00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:48.810
It's open!

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:55.090
Wan.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:57.810
Wan?

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.010
Come in.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.180
Check out this Glacial Sword.

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:05.860
- Check out this Glacial Sword. - Advanced Ice Talisman.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.460
Three gems for one talisman.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.570
Check this out.

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.730
Wan,

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.660
this is...

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.460
This is Tainan Bazaar.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.700
It

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:14.700
lasts for three days.

00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:15.490
We're lucky

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:16.420
to run into its opening.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:18.460
This is a fair price already.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:21.730
20 gems.

00:22:21.750 --> 00:22:22.900
Come. Take a look.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.460
Come.

00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:27.220
A century-old ironcoil snake.

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.330
It took me a lot to catch it.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:30.660
Glacial Sword!

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.220
Check out my Glacial Sword.

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:34.090
20 gems for one.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.050
Talisman.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:36.010
Do you want any?

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:36.530
Take a look.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:37.380
- Come. - Come take a look.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:40.140
My friend,

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.490
come browse my wares.

00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:42.700
- Come. - Advanced Ice...

00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:44.940
Advanced Ice Talisman for three gems only.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.940
Common items like these aren't very useful.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:49.090
They are common?

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:56.250
You need gems to buy them. Do you have any?

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:57.490
Besides,

00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:58.900
it's a rip-off.

00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.900
Are gems

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.180
the currency

00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:04.180
among cultivators?

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:06.660
Come on, Han.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.810
As the name

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:12.660
suggests,

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.330
a gem is a stone filled with spiritual aura.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.220
A good gem

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.090
is transparent and bright.

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:20.900
You can use it as a source of light.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.140
This is already a very fair price.

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.570
Mine is not as good,

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.660
but it's

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:29.900
good enough to provide energy

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.980
for an array or to restore your spiritual power

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:32.810
after a battle.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:00.090
Another rogue cultivator.

00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.770
How many has it been?

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:03.250
Grandmaster,

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.290
this is the seventh.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:06.980
Grandmaster,

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.180
I found this nearby.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.120
Yan?

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:10.920
[Qing, Yu]

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:11.900
From the Yan Clan Stronghold?

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:12.640
[Yan]

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:13.770
Those clan disciples

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.900
love to bully rogue cultivators.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:16.620
Enough.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.860
Do not jump to conclusions before we investigate thoroughly.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.010
Yes.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.940
The barrier has been lifted.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.290
The valley

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:24.700
is now filled with rogue and clan

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:25.700
disciples.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:27.140
Both parties are not on good terms

00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:28.460
so anything could happen.

00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:31.490
Yu, Qing.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.210
Dispatch more disciples

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.730
to guard the valley.

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:36.530
I don't want any accidents

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.980
before the Immortal Ascension Trials.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:39.860
Understood.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.220
Keen eyes, Miss.

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.220
The emerald stones embedded on the bracelet

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:53.940
come from

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:55.570
[Yan Ruyan]
the eyes of a Grade 2 Twinhead Raven.

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.460
Well,

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:57.330
it's a bit

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:57.940
expensive.

00:24:58.270 --> 00:24:59.050
500 gems.

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:00.010
500?

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:01.620
You might as well commit robbery.

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:02.900
- Do you know we are... - Enough.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:04.530
Scarcity brings up the price.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.460
Father will like this.

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:13.700
Miss, this is...

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.010
Take it.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.700
Thank you, Miss.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.090
I...

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:20.330
Thank the maker!

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.420
Stay there.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.660
They are the ones who killed Liu.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:29.530
Nonsense.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.090
Foundation Establishment Stage?

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:36.980
A Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator is her guard.

00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:39.490
Just who exactly is that woman?

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:40.490
Feng,

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:41.570
who said you could intervene?

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:44.010
[Feng]
Forgive me, Miss Yan.

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:45.330
Your safety

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:46.660
dictates the continuity of Yan Clan Stronghold.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.730
Master has instructed me

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.980
to prioritize your safety.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:50.460
She's Yan Ruyan?

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:52.860
Yan Ruyan?

00:25:53.070 --> 00:25:54.250
Is her family very famous?

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.860
Of course!

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.330
Her family is the top cultivation family in the Yue Kingdom.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:00.810
The paterfamilias, Yan Yunshan,

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:03.180
is her father.

00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:05.090
He's a cultivator in the Core Formation Stage.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.140
Wan,

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:11.290
you know many things.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.810
I'm so impressed.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:17.220
He is so knowledgeable.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.860
I should listen to him more.

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.140
Look.

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:24.250
I know everything about the cultivation world

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.050
in the Yue Kingdom.

00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.380
Just ask me anything if you have questions.

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:30.140
Thank you,

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:30.860
Wan.

00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:32.460
Just call me Xiaoshan.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:34.380
Xiaoshan.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:41.940
By the authority of the seven sects,

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.050
all troublemakers

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.180
will be disqualified from the trials

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.380
and expelled from Tainan Valley.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:49.980
As this is your first offense,

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.420
I'll forgive you but don't do it again.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.570
Leave right now.

00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:56.140
She's holding the token

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:59.860
of a Core Formation Stage cultivator from the Moonshadow Sect.

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:05.140
Miss Ruyan,

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.810
Grandmaster Nangong would like to see you.

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.090
What is the meaning of this?

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:09.090
Grandmaster Nangong?

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:10.490
Is your sect challenging Yan Clan Stronghold

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.770
for a few rogue cultivators?

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:14.010
Cease your impertinence, Feng.

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:15.570
Withdraw for now.

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.490
I will be back in a moment.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:25.730
Han,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:26.530
come.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:36.570
What a day.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:39.010
I saw a Foundation Establishment Stage cultivator serving as a guard

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:41.380
and also a token from a Core Formation Stage cultivator.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:44.980
There is always

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.570
someone more powerful than the powerful ones.

00:27:47.790 --> 00:27:48.770
If you see them

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.730
in the future, Han,

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:52.860
you run away.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:57.050
Run away?

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.050
Let's go.

00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:00.220
I'll show you around.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:04.010
Thank you so much,

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.460
Xiaoshan.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.420
No worries at all.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:08.530
Rogue cultivators are like my brothers.

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.220
If you have further...

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:12.770
Are you all right?

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.900
Are you all right?

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:14.570
I'm fine.

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:15.380
Thank you.

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.180
Look where you're going.

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:16.660
Okay.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.570
You sure are stealthy, my friend.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:23.010
But

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:24.570
[Daoist Qingwen]
I suggest

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:25.860
you return the pouch to its owner.

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.900
[Hu Pinggu]
Didn't you promise

00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.770
to stop stealing?

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.900
[Wu Jiuzhi]

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.530
Xiaoshan,

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:39.980
it seems like we have thieves among the cultivators too.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.460
He took your pouch first.

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:44.050
I merely grabbed some interest on your behalf.

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:45.140
Isn't it fair?

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:46.770
You...

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:47.380
I

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.570
just wanted to borrow it.

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:50.250
I didn't say I wouldn't return it.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:52.860
Give it back.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:57.980
Give it back.

00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:59.330
Give it back!

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:01.330
He took my things and won't give them back.

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:03.010
You two

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:04.810
should check if your personal effects are intact.

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:05.570
That's right.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:08.090
This happens on the Azure Vein Society's territory.

00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.140
Our leader

00:29:09.310 --> 00:29:10.620
will intervene.

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.530
You belong to the Azure Vein Society?

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:13.980
Qingwen is my Dharma name.

00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.980
This is my peer, Hu Pinggu.

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:16.980
My friend,

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.220
since you've heard of my society,

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:19.860
will you be so kind

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.050
as to look past what the thief did?

00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:27.570
It feels like you're reciting lines.

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.490
Is this perhaps a premeditated ruse?

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:30.810
Han,

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:32.940
Daoist Qingwen is known for his heroic deeds

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:34.700
among the rogue cultivators.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.330
We have not suffered any losses.

00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:38.860
Let's just move on.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.980
Everything's fine.

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.460
Everything's fine.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:41.290
Let's go, Han.

00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:44.140
Give back the pouch.

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:49.050
Thank you.

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:49.860
My friends,

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.330
Wu Jiuzhi is mischievous,

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:53.570
but he bears no ill intention.

00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.490
If he did offend you,

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:56.220
I

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:57.330
apologize

00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:58.140
on his behalf.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:58.860
That's right.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.090
- We crossed paths today. - These two

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.900
are either crooks...

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:01.620
How may I...

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.730
- or fraudsters. - address you two?

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.860
I should stay away from them.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.570
You're too courteous, sir.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.250
I am Wan Xiaoshan.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.700
This is my friend, Han Li.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:09.810
And he exposed my name just like that.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:14.140
You look like

00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.900
you're here for the trials.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:16.900
Our society

00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.380
has rented a venue nearby

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:20.010
to discuss the trials

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:21.220
with other rogue cultivators.

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.380
Would you like

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.490
to join us?

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.380
Of course.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:28.420
Grandmaster,

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.940
Miss Ruyan from the Yan Clan Stronghold is here.

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.700
I'm Yan Ruyan of the Yan Clan Stronghold.

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.250
Greetings, Grandmaster Nangong.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.050
I was told you brought a lot of guards

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.570
to Tainan with you.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.980
Grandmaster Nangong,

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:50.420
while I can't speak for other prestigious families,

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:51.900
I can reassure you

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.620
that my guards have never left my side

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.050
ever since I set foot in Tainan.

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.010
My family has nothing to do

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:59.730
with the disappearance of rogue cultivators.

00:31:01.510 --> 00:31:02.980
You keep yourself abreast with the goings-on.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.090
But how do you explain this?

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.780
[Yan]

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.090
We found this

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.980
next to a dead rogue cultivator.

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:11.460
Grandmaster Nangong,

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:12.860
a female attendant of mine

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.420
had her token stolen

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.810
since we entered Tainan.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.730
Someone is obviously trying to frame me.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.860
Have you decided on which sect to join?

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:31.700
Grandfather recommended Spirit Beast Mountain many times.

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:33.660
But I prefer the Moonshadow Sect.

00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:35.810
You have better taste than your grandfather.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.050
All right. You may return.

00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:40.940
Be prepared for the trials tomorrow.

00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:45.530
Grandmaster,

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:48.010
judging from those brash rogue cultivators just now,

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.330
they were clearly manipulated by someone else.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:51.860
Yet Yan Clan Stronghold

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.180
does not make enemies often.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.220
Do you know

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.180
who is trying to frame us?

00:31:57.790 --> 00:31:58.570
In my opinion,

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.290
Yan Clan Stronghold is not the only target.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.180
Your behavior

00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:04.810
does not merely represent your family,

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.050
but also other clan disciples

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.140
like you.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:10.620
Someone is trying to exacerbate the divide

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:12.220
between the clan disciples and rogue cultivators.

00:32:17.030 --> 00:32:18.010
I shall take my leave.

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:31.770
Grandmaster.

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.770
I can't let Spirit Beast Mountain

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.010
take away a smart girl like her.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:38.250
My friends,

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.940
this is our base.

[Map]

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:00.980
This is a map of the Yue Kingdom.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.940
I chanced upon this map

00:33:03.750 --> 00:33:04.530
and found it intriguing.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.220
You can find

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.490
all seven sects on it.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:08.940
That's the Moonshadow Sect.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:09.660
That's the Spirit Beast Mountain.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.530
That's the Saber-Shearing Sect.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:11.330
That's the Clear Void Sect.

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.980
Skyfort Castle.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.050
That's the Yellow Maple Valley.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.570
That's the Giant Sword Sect.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.380
These seven cultivating sects

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:17.660
are generally abbreviated as the seven sects.

00:33:18.030 --> 00:33:19.180
They survived a fierce battle

in the Yue Kingdom.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:21.860
Then,

00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.180
where is Yan Clan Stronghold?

00:33:24.110 --> 00:33:25.090
Yan Clan Stronghold.

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:25.700
Here.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:26.700
[Yan Clan Stronghold]
That's the Yan Clan Stronghold.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.180
- Yes. - That's right.

There.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:28.220
Yes.

There.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:29.320
Then,

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:31.140
where do rogue cultivators belong?

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.620
We...

00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.010
We're not on this map.

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.050
I might even say

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:41.220
that we won't have a place in the Yue Kingdom either.

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.140
Enough, Qingwen.

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:43.180
We brought them here

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:44.980
to discuss the trials.

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:46.330
Why bring this up?

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:48.700
I'm sorry.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.810
Some rogue cultivators have gone missing lately.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:52.900
Some are also left stranded...

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.620
Qingwen.

00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:55.940
What are they trying to achieve?

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.940
They never finish their sentence,

00:33:58.510 --> 00:33:59.380
and that only diverts more attention to them.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:00.900
We're cultivating as well.

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:02.570
How come some were born

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.380
with access to so many resources,

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.420
while we

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:07.530
have to risk our lives

00:34:08.350 --> 00:34:09.420
for a Foundation Pill?

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.460
Exactly.

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.220
That's unfair.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.180
A Foundation Pill?

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.570
What is that?

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.620
You cannot not know this.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.530
A Foundation Pill

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.730
can help a cultivator to get to the Foundation Establishment Stage

00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:22.810
from the Qi Refining Stage.

00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:24.220
Qi Refining Stage?

00:34:26.790 --> 00:34:27.860
Which stage am I in?

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:29.940
If you're just starting out,

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:31.180
you're in the Qi Refining Stage.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:36.490
And then?

00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.420
Listen carefully.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:39.810
In the world of cultivation,

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.380
all stages can be divided into

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.290
lower level, middle level,

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.220
and upper level.

00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:46.290
The lower level stages include

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:47.570
the Qi Refining Stage,

00:34:47.750 --> 00:34:48.330
the Foundation Establishment Stage,

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.090
the Core Formation Stage,

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:49.810
the Nascent Soul Stage,

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:50.900
and the Spirit Transformation Stage.

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:52.050
The middle level stages

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:52.730
are

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:53.980
the Void Refining Stage,

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.860
the Body Unity Stage,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:55.860
and the Great Ascension Stage.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:57.140
The upper level stage

00:34:57.350 --> 00:34:58.220
only has

00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.570
the Tribulation Transcendence Stage.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:00.770
If you ascend from this stage,

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.420
you can

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:02.420
become an immortal

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:03.380
and live as long as the universe.

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:06.090
But these are just myths.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.730
No one has seen anyone above

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:08.770
the Nascent Soul Stage.

00:35:10.830 --> 00:35:11.730
Is it very difficult

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:13.770
to get a Foundation Pill?

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.620
It's not just difficult to get one.

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:18.250
The pill

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.250
determines the fate of a cultivator,

00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:21.530
and by extension,

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.490
the future of a sect.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:25.420
Therefore,

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.770
in the past, the seven sects

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.180
and the prestigious families

00:35:28.270 --> 00:35:29.530
had a monopoly over the pills.

00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:32.140
They have all the pills.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:35.980
Until the trials came along.

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:38.290
Han,

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:40.770
at a glance, the trials

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.770
give you a chance

00:35:41.830 --> 00:35:43.570
to enter the seven sects.

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:44.820
But in reality,

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.570
everyone is after the pills.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.260
500 years ago,

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.650
a veteran rogue cultivator

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.380
gathered thousands of other rogue cultivators

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:53.740
to negotiate with the seven sects.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:55.610
Thanks to them, we now have a chance to compete fairly

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.490
against disciples of prestigious clans

00:35:57.550 --> 00:35:59.300
to enter the seven sects.

00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.860
And as a result,

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.010
we also become their enemies.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.530
But let's be frank.

00:36:04.070 --> 00:36:06.010
We rogue cultivators do not have access to many things.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:07.210
And those who hail from a prestigious clan

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:08.860
can feed their disciples with tons of elixirs.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:10.210
How is this fair?

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:11.650
Yes, that's not fair.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.090
Uneven distribution of resources.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.530
No wonder

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.820
they hate

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.860
the clan disciples.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.460
Have you found anything about the rogue cultivators?

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.050
Several men are following

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:23.460
the core members as we speak.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.460
The leader is a man called Qingwen.

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:28.130
He has only attained Tier 11 of the Qi Refining Stage,

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.170
but he is a great speaker.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:31.650
He has many followers

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.300
among the rogue cultivators.

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:34.380
Keep a close eye on him.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.170
Let me know

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.300
if anything happens.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:38.010
Yes.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:41.860
My friends,

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:44.900
the seven sects will put us through two trials.

00:36:45.070 --> 00:36:45.490
The first one

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.980
is the spirit root trial tomorrow.

00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:47.820
The second one

00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:49.860
is the Tianwu Arena trial tomorrow.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:51.980
The Tianwu Arena trial

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:52.940
is very dangerous.

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:53.900
Therefore,

00:36:54.190 --> 00:36:56.010
we must secure a spot

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.170
in tomorrow's trial first.

00:36:58.230 --> 00:36:59.170
A spirit root

00:36:59.400 --> 00:36:59.860
comes in

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.340
five elements: metal, wood, water,

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:02.210
fire, and earth.

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:03.170
You know it already.

00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:05.050
- Metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. - Mortals do not have a spirit root

00:37:05.070 --> 00:37:06.170
so they cannot cultivate.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.780
The more spirit roots you have,

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.380
the worse you progress.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:12.740
Those who have four or five spirit root elements

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.050
can sense the spiritual aura around us.

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.090
Yet they can only reach

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.380
Tier 3 or Tier 4 in their lives at most.

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:22.130
We call this

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.490
a fake spirit root.

00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:24.890
- Fake spirit root? - Fake spirit root?

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.420
Those who have two or three spirit root elements

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:28.900
have

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.090
a true spirit root.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:31.650
Sir,

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.380
what if the spirit root comes with only one element?

00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:35.650
Then, it is an exceptionally rare heavenly spirit root

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:37.650
A cultivator with that gift

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:38.940
has earned the favor of the maker.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.860
His progress

00:37:41.070 --> 00:37:41.860
will defy comprehension.

00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.090
I see. Cultivation is deeply tied to one's talent.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:48.690
In that case, do I have a true spirit root

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:49.980
or a fake spirit root?

00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.460
Physician Mo never told me.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:58.420
I hope I have the heavenly spirit root.

00:37:59.590 --> 00:38:01.090
There are only limited spots

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.380
for those who wish to enroll in the seven sects

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.170
through the spirit root trial.

00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:05.420
People from the prestigious clan

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.340
will do what they can to take our spots

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.420
in the seven sects.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:10.940
They wish to impede our cultivation.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.130
So, power speaks the loudest

00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:19.090
in the cultivation world.

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.650
Tier 1 to Tier 13.

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:27.610
It is the complete set of Longevity Art.

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.610
Interested?

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:35.420
Pay up.

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:36.490
How much?

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:37.690
Nine gems.

00:38:37.690 --> 00:38:38.220
[Meng Wu]

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.860
Nine gems?

00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:40.820
That's too expensive.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:44.900
Tier 10 of the Qi Refining Stage?

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:46.570
Now you've seen what I can do.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.900
Pay up.

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:53.380
Little girl,

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.740
I do want to buy

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.900
this book.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.780
But nine gems is too expensive.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.210
Can I ask for a better price?

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:00.420
How much are you offering?

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.860
Two?

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.090
Da.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:07.010
Er.

00:39:07.230 --> 00:39:07.980
San.

00:39:08.110 --> 00:39:08.650
Si.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.860
Come!

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.210
Is this the guy?

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:13.340
That's right.

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:15.490
He read our book

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.650
but refused to pay.

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.900
I'm selling it for nine gems.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.340
But he only offered two.

00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:20.500
[Meng Da, Meng Si]

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:22.460
What in the daylight robbery!

00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:22.940
[Meng San, Meng Er]

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:23.980
What?

00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.820
How did you know we were robbers

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:26.780
before we started cultivating?

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.050
- How did you know? - How did you know?

00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:29.740
We quit many years ago.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:30.740
How did you know?

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:32.210
Speak up.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:33.820
Everyone,

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:35.980
this sign means two

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:38.530
strengthening pills

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:39.940
for your book.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.010
What do you think?

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.420
Give me

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:52.980
the book.

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.490
Stand there.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:06.170
You can't leave.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.260
I gave you the pills.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:14.460
What else do you want?

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:17.740
Your pills...

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:18.340
You overpaid.

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:20.010
Yes.

00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.650
Yes.

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.780
You can have the Longevity Art book.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.690
This mega mystic pouch

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.170
is a gift for you as well.

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:31.690
It's a gift.

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.780
The Five Mengs

00:40:38.150 --> 00:40:39.740
are righteous!

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:42.820
Indeed.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:43.610
Indeed.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:44.260
Farewell.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:47.650
No need to see me off!

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:48.300
No need!

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.740
The pills

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:57.210
are more useful than gems.

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:59.340
Lucky for me, I brought extra when I left

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.210
Shenshou Valley.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:02.210
And now,

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:04.010
I also have a mystic pouch.

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:06.570
I no longer have to bring many bags with me.

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.780
For your fragment of a magic item,

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.010
I'll buy it for five low-grade gems.

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:12.900
What do you think?

00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:13.860
No.

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.380
[Han Yunzhi]
It is nonetheless

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:17.210
a fragment from a Core Formation Stage cultivator's magic item.

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:18.820
You keep promoting it.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.090
What can it do

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:21.010
exactly?

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:22.940
It's very useful.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:25.380
Look.

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.210
I...

00:41:28.590 --> 00:41:29.900
I can use that fragment

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.860
to hide the Green Vial.

00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:37.740
It is a fragment of a magic item, all right.

00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:39.170
But it's

00:41:39.350 --> 00:41:40.260
[Lu Mingyuan]
too small.

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.460
You know what?

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:43.900
Given you also have a cute face,

00:41:44.150 --> 00:41:44.940
I will offer

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.650
one strengthening pill.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:48.860
Mister Lu,

00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.570
[Chen Qiaoqian, Chen Rong]
you're taking advantage of her.

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:52.010
I offer six gems.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.170
Can I have it?

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.300
I offer seven gems.

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:56.210
Eight gems.

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:57.130
Okay.

00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.250
Eight gems, it is.

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:02.130
Sorry.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:03.740
I was just joking around.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.300
[Chen Mu]
Me too.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.940
Besides, Miss.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.860
Your fragment

00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:09.130
truly isn't worth that much.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:19.460
Miss.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:20.650
Don't go.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.570
They don't want it, but I do.

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.610
One gem.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:25.490
I offer one gem.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.420
I'm asking for seven gems.

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.650
All of you...

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.380
Is anyone else interested?

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:36.690
I don't think anyone else is bidding.

00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:37.980
Anyone?

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:40.820
Two vials of Golden Marrow Pill

00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:42.530
for your fragment of a magic item, please.

00:42:43.590 --> 00:42:44.940
Please don't tell me you're joking around too.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.530
Deal.

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:11.530
My friend,

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:12.820
why are you doing this?

00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.980
You ruined my negotiation for no reason at all.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.170
You think you can leave?

00:43:19.710 --> 00:43:20.300
But

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.210
I bought this fragment

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:23.780
with a fair price.

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:25.570
Isn't this a fair trade?

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:26.530
Fine.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.130
Let me teach you

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.820
