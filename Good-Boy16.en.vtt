WEBVTT

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:53.721
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
EVENTS, AND GROUPS ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:53.804 --> 00:00:56.056
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:00.770
Min Ju-yeong.

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:04.607
The bastard is crazier
than you can ever imagine.

00:01:06.484 --> 00:01:08.736
He's never satisfied
unless he takes what he wants

00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:12.448
or destroys what he can't have.

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:25.753
Toluene, huh?

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:28.297
This is impressive.

00:01:29.924 --> 00:01:31.717
If that's your last resort
for when things go south,

00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:33.469
I'd say it's an overkill.

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:39.517
This is enough to blow up the whole city.

00:01:41.644 --> 00:01:42.645
It had better be.

00:01:44.355 --> 00:01:46.690
I'll destroy every last thing I built…

00:01:49.693 --> 00:01:51.028
with my own hands.

00:01:54.615 --> 00:01:56.325
I can't say when he'll snap…

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:01.831
but now could be it
since he has nowhere to run.

00:02:04.542 --> 00:02:05.543
Be careful.

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:34.446
You can look forward to it.

00:02:36.574 --> 00:02:39.577
Today is going to be a very memorable day.

00:02:50.588 --> 00:02:51.422
Get out.

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:52.673
Get out now.

00:02:52.756 --> 00:02:53.799
Get the hell out!

00:02:53.883 --> 00:02:56.385
Don't come near here!

00:03:08.355 --> 00:03:10.316
Han-na, get over here.

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:37.718
Honey… Jeong-a…

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:40.679
Honey… Jeong-a…

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.394
It doesn't matter how it started.

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.190
What matters…

00:03:53.067 --> 00:03:54.526
is how it ends.

00:03:57.029 --> 00:03:58.948
This is a world
where no one plays by the rules.

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.914
There's only one way to stand against them

00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:08.999
and win.

00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:11.293
And that's to deliver

00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:13.420
a perfect KO victory…

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:20.052
that no one can dispute.

00:04:23.555 --> 00:04:28.352
FINALE

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.042
If you'd done what I asked,
I wouldn't have come down so hard.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.504
I don't know anything about stowing away.

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:58.173
So how was I supposed to do
what you asked?

00:04:58.257 --> 00:04:59.925
By any means possible.

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.468
It was me who asked you for a favor.

00:05:03.303 --> 00:05:04.346
Would you rather

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:09.518
that I ask you again
in front of your wife and daughter?

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:11.729
Mr. Min.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.648
I'm really sorry,

00:05:14.732 --> 00:05:18.277
but that's beyond my reach.

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:19.737
I guess that means

00:05:20.863 --> 00:05:22.948
I don't need you anymore.

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:30.330
Look, I did try my best.

00:05:30.414 --> 00:05:31.457
I'm sorry.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.834
So please, Mr. Min.

00:05:33.917 --> 00:05:35.127
-Please spare--
-Shut up already.

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:51.727
Where are Captain and Jae-hong?

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:56.106
I think they're over there.

00:06:00.235 --> 00:06:01.695
Hospital? Oh, dear.

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:03.322
Captain, are you okay?

00:06:03.906 --> 00:06:06.575
Dong-ju, I almost died.

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:10.329
Do you know how scared I was?
Goodness, Dong-ju…

00:06:10.996 --> 00:06:14.249
I would've died
if I didn't have this with me.

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:17.294
My wife and daughter saved my life.

00:06:17.377 --> 00:06:19.505
I held onto this and prayed so hard.

00:06:19.588 --> 00:06:22.174
This is a genuine lucky charm!

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:24.635
-You're going overboard, Captain.
-No, I'm not!

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:26.929
-It's okay.
-Hey, you bastards!

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:29.348
I told you to come quickly!
Everything blew up already!

00:06:31.934 --> 00:06:33.393
We should've stopped them.

00:06:46.824 --> 00:06:48.283
EXPLODED TRUCKS' CARGO
CONFIRMED AS "CANDY"

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:57.334
How long are you going to just sit back
and do nothing?

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.128
What do you want, punk?

00:07:02.047 --> 00:07:03.465
"The duties of the Korean police

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:07.386
are to protect the lives, safety,
and property of citizens,

00:07:08.095 --> 00:07:10.139
to prevent, suppress,
and investigate crimes,

00:07:10.222 --> 00:07:11.765
to guard key facilities,

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:14.726
and to maintain public order
and security."

00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:21.066
How long are you going to keep running
and look the other way?

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.442
Aren't you ashamed?

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.486
As the police commissioner

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:26.196
and a Korean police officer…

00:07:27.948 --> 00:07:29.575
you need to fulfill those duties.

00:07:35.581 --> 00:07:37.624
Fine, you and your team were right.

00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:40.919
Dozens of high-ranking officials in Insung

00:07:41.003 --> 00:07:43.589
have long been in cahoots
with Min Ju-yeong.

00:07:44.298 --> 00:07:45.257
Tell me.

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.885
Do you think you can tackle it overnight?

00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:54.516
A paint factory in Gihyeon-dong
used to use this warehouse.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.226
But the company went under two years ago,

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.062
and with a lien on this place,
they haven't been able to use it.

00:07:59.146 --> 00:08:01.273
A paint factory in Gihyeon-dong?

00:08:01.356 --> 00:08:02.900
The place where we caught Golden Bunny?

00:08:03.567 --> 00:08:04.776
The manager at the time--

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.028
It was probably Min Ju-yeong.

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:09.489
Yeah. We need to catch Min Ju-yeong fast,

00:08:09.573 --> 00:08:11.909
or nothing will be left of Insung City.

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:15.245
If you're that worried,
then step up and help us out.

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:17.831
I'm putting my neck on the line
and doing the best I can!

00:08:17.915 --> 00:08:19.208
Captain.

00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:20.918
I checked the CCTV at the entrance,

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.920
and a total of five trucks
left the warehouse.

00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:26.715
There were four explosions in the city.

00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.261
Then where's the remaining truck?

00:08:35.307 --> 00:08:36.725
This isn't over yet.

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:41.021
I'll get the plate numbers
and put out an APB.

00:08:41.605 --> 00:08:42.981
Forget the commissioner.

00:08:43.065 --> 00:08:44.816
Deploy units, no matter what.

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:46.443
All right, I got it.

00:08:50.697 --> 00:08:51.740
By the way,

00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:55.202
how did you know there were explosives?

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:05.754
What's Min Ju-yeong's next plan?

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:06.838
Choose your words wisely.

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:10.259
What you say
will affect how you're treated.

00:09:11.218 --> 00:09:12.344
He'll probably run.

00:09:12.427 --> 00:09:14.346
Maybe he'll skip town or even the country.

00:09:14.429 --> 00:09:17.307
There are checkpoints set up
at every exit leading out of Insung.

00:09:17.391 --> 00:09:19.977
We've also blocked
every escape route by sea.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.813
That's right.
It'll be impossible to stow away.

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.357
I know just about every escape route,
top to bottom.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.234
He'll still escape

00:09:27.317 --> 00:09:28.652
by any means possible.

00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:30.445
That's just who he is.

00:09:32.948 --> 00:09:34.074
Exactly.

00:09:34.157 --> 00:09:35.867
That's just who he is.

00:09:37.661 --> 00:09:40.038
You've been clueless about him
for the last 20 years or so.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.124
He won't get caught that easily.

00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:45.043
He'll definitely escape.

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.212
More than likely,

00:09:47.296 --> 00:09:48.880
someone will help him.

00:09:50.048 --> 00:09:51.049
Who?

00:09:51.133 --> 00:09:52.134
Before I tell you,

00:09:53.093 --> 00:09:54.386
I'd like to eat.

00:09:56.013 --> 00:09:58.348
How about kimchi jjigae
made by a former national team athlete?

00:10:00.767 --> 00:10:02.311
Gwang-se, get some kimchi jjigae.

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:03.812
I'll make it for you.

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:05.605
You can't eat until you tell us.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.694
What are you waiting for?
If you tell us, we'll make it.

00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:18.285
Who would help Min Ju-yeong?

00:10:18.994 --> 00:10:20.704
And for nothing in return?

00:10:22.497 --> 00:10:24.082
Just tell us who it is!

00:10:24.166 --> 00:10:25.917
Tell us now,
or we'll do this the hard way.

00:10:26.001 --> 00:10:27.377
Want us to force the answer out of you?

00:10:30.047 --> 00:10:31.465
You see,

00:10:32.674 --> 00:10:34.801
there's a weird charm about Min Ju-yeong.

00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:37.054
Someone who fell for it

00:10:37.929 --> 00:10:39.931
would help for nothing in return.

00:10:42.434 --> 00:10:43.852
Perhaps such devotion…

00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:47.522
should be called love.

00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:51.943
It could be that woman.

00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:58.158
That woman?

00:11:03.705 --> 00:11:06.166
Kim Yu-na has been on sick leave
since the ninth.

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:07.584
She was supposed to return yesterday,

00:11:07.667 --> 00:11:09.336
but she was a no-show without any notice.

00:11:09.878 --> 00:11:13.215
And nobody can reach Min Ju-yeong's boss,
Section Chief Song Yeong-sik.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:15.217
So did she and Mr. Min Ju-yeong…

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.635
Okay, got it.

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:22.432
Understood. Thank you.

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:25.394
I checked the CCTV footage.

00:11:25.477 --> 00:11:28.647
She left at 11:05 p.m. two days ago
and never returned.

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:32.150
She didn't show up to work either,
and her phone is turned off.

00:11:32.234 --> 00:11:34.569
Let's leave the lost truck
to the senior superintendent

00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:35.821
and focus on Ms. Kim.

00:11:36.822 --> 00:11:40.283
I'll trace her movements
and reach out to her phone carrier

00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.119
to locate where her last phone call
was made.

00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:46.164
And in case she returns,
you two continue the stakeout here.

00:11:46.248 --> 00:11:47.082
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:12:07.978 --> 00:12:08.854
What's all this?

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:15.694
Here.

00:12:17.028 --> 00:12:18.280
Thanks.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.713
What? Are you not going to eat?

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:36.631
It's not that.

00:12:37.716 --> 00:12:39.342
I'm just wondering if you're okay now.

00:12:39.885 --> 00:12:40.927
I am.

00:12:41.011 --> 00:12:43.305
Eat up. I should've bought more.

00:12:44.097 --> 00:12:45.640
You have to eat well for a quick recovery.

00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.689
Try it. It's good.

00:12:54.024 --> 00:12:55.025
Are you sure?

00:12:58.945 --> 00:12:59.988
Jeez.

00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.410
-What are you--
-So you need someone to feed you, huh?

00:13:06.745 --> 00:13:07.787
Just a second.

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:09.664
I said I'm not eating.

00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:10.874
Here.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:12.459
-Quit it.
-Open wide.

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:14.294
-Open wide.
-I don't want it.

00:13:14.377 --> 00:13:16.046
You have to eat to keep going.

00:13:17.923 --> 00:13:19.382
Look at you eating like a champ.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.761
So? It's good, right?

00:13:24.513 --> 00:13:25.514
There we go.

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:33.480
I knew you were hungry.

00:13:34.272 --> 00:13:36.858
Jeez, what are you, a kid?
You have food all over your mouth.

00:13:37.901 --> 00:13:39.152
Just look at you.

00:13:40.487 --> 00:13:41.905
You got some on here too.

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:45.367
Time to switch.

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:50.747
-See you.
-Hey, take your drink.

00:13:52.207 --> 00:13:53.166
Hey.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:02.092
INSUNG PAWNSHOP

00:14:03.802 --> 00:14:04.928
What about the escape routes?

00:14:05.011 --> 00:14:06.680
Am I your subordinate?

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:08.848
The stowaway brokers are quiet,
and there's no sign of him.

00:14:08.932 --> 00:14:10.934
Anyway, Insung has become a damn mess.

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:12.644
I hear the yakuza are also in town.

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:14.896
The yakuza?

00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.191
Min Ju-yeong made a deal
to sell drugs to them,

00:14:18.275 --> 00:14:21.361
and things seem to be falling apart
after the deal went south.

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:25.323
Instead of collecting penalty fees,
the yakuza put a hefty price on his head,

00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:28.702
and gangsters from all over the country
have slipped into Insung.

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:31.079
They're fighting like wild animals

00:14:31.162 --> 00:14:33.456
to take over the businesses
Min Ju-yeong used to manage.

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.668
I guess the technical term
would be "shitshow."

00:14:36.751 --> 00:14:37.752
Let's move out.

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:42.090
Seriously?

00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:44.384
Goddammit.

00:14:48.346 --> 00:14:50.932
Boss, they're searching this whole area.

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:52.058
Fucking hell.

00:14:56.438 --> 00:14:57.439
Hey, Ha.

00:14:57.522 --> 00:14:58.982
It's me, Baek.

00:14:59.065 --> 00:15:00.650
Let me borrow some of your guys.

00:15:01.234 --> 00:15:03.194
I need to find that son of a bitch
Min Ju-yeong

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:06.323
and kill him.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.496
Go make your own way now.

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:16.916
I'll do the same.

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:19.878
Go on.

00:15:29.429 --> 00:15:30.430
Damn it.

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:39.147
-What is it?
-Let's switch.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.315
I'm okay.

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:42.525
You need to rest and go to the hospital.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.569
You should go to the hospital.

00:15:44.653 --> 00:15:46.237
-What? Why?
-Be quiet!

00:15:49.282 --> 00:15:50.283
Hi, Senior Officer Ji.

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:52.285
Hello.

00:15:52.369 --> 00:15:53.536
Hey, I'm getting a call.

00:15:56.539 --> 00:15:57.540
Hey, Senior Officer Shin.

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:03.338
-Ms. Kim Yu-na.
-Oh, jeez.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:04.964
I'm a police officer.

00:16:06.091 --> 00:16:09.052
There was activity
on Ms. Kim Yu-na's credit card

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:10.470
at the convenience store over there,

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:11.763
so I brought her here.

00:16:19.604 --> 00:16:21.606
Refusing to talk to us

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:23.441
will only work to your disadvantage.

00:16:23.525 --> 00:16:26.486
If you help Min Ju-yeong escape,

00:16:26.569 --> 00:16:28.905
you could face charges
of aiding and harboring a fugitive.

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.323
It's a serious matter.

00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:38.039
It's okay, Ms. Kim.
Talk to us, and we'll help you.

00:16:44.838 --> 00:16:47.006
He said he had to go overseas in a hurry.

00:16:48.842 --> 00:16:50.009
What?

00:16:50.093 --> 00:16:51.886
He asked me to go with him.

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:54.431
I'm supposed to meet with him later.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:56.057
Where?

00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:58.059
At the Victory Hotel.

00:17:05.108 --> 00:17:07.235
It's time. Keep an eye out.

00:17:07.318 --> 00:17:08.570
Let's go.

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:19.289
If anything happens outside,
radio us immediately.

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:21.040
Got it.

00:17:30.842 --> 00:17:31.676
What the heck?

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.930
-It's not him, right?
-No.

00:17:36.681 --> 00:17:39.517
Captain, can you check the people
entering right now?

00:17:40.435 --> 00:17:41.352
Okay.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.901
Who are those people?

00:17:48.485 --> 00:17:49.444
I'll go find out.

00:17:58.620 --> 00:17:59.954
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:18:25.146 --> 00:18:26.064
What did they say?

00:18:26.147 --> 00:18:27.941
There's a shareholders' meeting
at 4:00 p.m.

00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:30.026
in the convention hall
regarding the sale of the hotel.

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:32.153
Min Ju-yeong owns the place
under a borrowed name,

00:18:32.237 --> 00:18:35.323
and I think he's planning to sell it
before it gets seized.

00:18:35.406 --> 00:18:38.743
So you're saying that all those people
are shareholders?

00:18:38.827 --> 00:18:40.787
District head, city council member,

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.956
customs commissioner,
port authority chief,

00:18:43.039 --> 00:18:45.458
coast guard chief,
and even a departmental chief prosecutor.

00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:49.045
They're only looking out
for their own interests.

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:50.338
Look at them trying so hard.

00:18:50.421 --> 00:18:53.091
They're all on Min Ju-yeong's list.

00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:54.217
Something bugs me.

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.512
Could it be a coincidence
that the shareholders' meeting

00:18:57.595 --> 00:19:00.557
is scheduled at the same time
Ms. Kim is supposed to meet Min Ju-yeong?

00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:04.435
You're right.

00:19:05.854 --> 00:19:07.105
Something's off.

00:19:08.815 --> 00:19:10.441
The same goes for Ms. Kim Yu-na.

00:19:11.025 --> 00:19:13.611
She turned off her phone
to avoid being tracked,

00:19:13.695 --> 00:19:15.363
but she used her own credit card

00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:17.615
right near her place
where we were staking out.

00:19:23.788 --> 00:19:26.749
Let's split up and monitor the area.

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:28.585
I'll go see the hotel security team.

00:19:28.668 --> 00:19:31.004
Then let's go to the convention hall.

00:19:31.087 --> 00:19:33.214
What about Ms. Kim Yu-na?

00:19:33.298 --> 00:19:35.508
I want you and Senior Officer Ji
to keep an eye on her.

00:19:35.592 --> 00:19:38.428
-Min Ju-yeong might not show up after all.
-Got it.

00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:40.638
Radio us if anything happens.

00:19:40.722 --> 00:19:42.015
-Let's go.
-Okay.

00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.989
Senior Officer Ji,
I'm watching Ms. Kim Yu-na too.

00:20:06.623 --> 00:20:08.750
INSUNG S&amp;E CORP

00:20:17.008 --> 00:20:19.344
Senior Officer Shin,
keep an eye on Ms. Kim Yu-na.

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:21.638
Don't worry.

00:20:21.721 --> 00:20:23.264
I won't even blink.

00:20:38.988 --> 00:20:41.783
VICTORY HOTEL
SPECIAL SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING

00:20:52.001 --> 00:20:52.919
Hello.

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:54.545
I have a question.

00:20:55.672 --> 00:20:58.341
It's about the people who just left.
Why were they here?

00:20:58.424 --> 00:21:00.259
Oh, it was for the shareholders' meeting.

00:21:00.343 --> 00:21:03.137
They've been checking the sprinklers
and such since last night.

00:21:03.221 --> 00:21:04.639
They just finished up their work.

00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:05.723
Okay, thank you.

00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:16.484
Can you spare me a minute?
I'm with the police.

00:21:19.862 --> 00:21:22.198
Where can I find
the hotel's security team…

00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.203
Where's the security team?

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:31.207
The man who just left is Jang Yeong-gyu,
the security team leader.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:21:59.736
Powder?

00:21:59.819 --> 00:22:03.281
Was there anything
other than toluene in that warehouse?

00:22:05.658 --> 00:22:06.659
Could that be it?

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:10.496
Sodium cyanide.

00:22:11.581 --> 00:22:12.623
What's that?

00:22:31.726 --> 00:22:32.894
Ms. Kim Yu-na!

00:22:33.603 --> 00:22:34.604
Taxi!

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:40.485
Please drive. Hurry!

00:22:41.444 --> 00:22:42.445
Ms. Kim!

00:22:43.112 --> 00:22:44.113
Ms. Kim Yu-na!

00:22:44.655 --> 00:22:46.115
Don't go to Min Ju-yeong!

00:22:46.199 --> 00:22:47.450
Ms. Kim Yu-na!

00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:48.451
Min Ju-yeong is…

00:22:48.951 --> 00:22:50.536
He's the bad guy!

00:22:51.704 --> 00:22:52.997
Ms. Kim Yu-na took off.

00:22:54.624 --> 00:22:56.125
He said Ms. Kim Yu-na took off.

00:22:56.793 --> 00:22:58.669
Damn it, I knew it.

00:22:58.753 --> 00:22:59.754
Sergeant Kim!

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:03.508
I just saw a guy from the Jungdong Tunnel.

00:23:03.966 --> 00:23:04.801
What?

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:06.344
Something's not right.

00:23:08.012 --> 00:23:09.097
Han-na.

00:23:10.139 --> 00:23:11.808
I just found out

00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:14.519
there was something
other than toluene in the warehouse.

00:23:14.602 --> 00:23:16.479
It's an industrial raw material.

00:23:16.562 --> 00:23:19.524
It's a toxic substance,
but it's not flammable or explosive.

00:23:19.607 --> 00:23:21.150
However,

00:23:21.234 --> 00:23:23.986
when it comes in contact with water,
it produces hydrogen cyanide.

00:23:24.862 --> 00:23:26.239
And that's lethal.

00:23:26.322 --> 00:23:28.199
It's been used as a poison gas,

00:23:29.033 --> 00:23:31.494
and its flammable properties
can trigger explosions.

00:23:31.577 --> 00:23:34.122
Do you think the remaining truck…

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:43.297
Don't tell me that bastard
is trying to kill everyone here.

00:23:43.881 --> 00:23:46.092
If everyone here dies,

00:23:46.175 --> 00:23:47.885
Insung's administration will be paralyzed.

00:23:48.886 --> 00:23:50.888
That will give him a chance to escape.

00:23:51.973 --> 00:23:53.891
This time, we must stop it at all costs.

00:23:54.475 --> 00:23:56.727
Whatever the case,
we need to evacuate everyone.

00:23:56.811 --> 00:23:58.271
-That's the right move.
-Okay.

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:04.569
Excuse me. Sorry.

00:24:04.652 --> 00:24:06.612
Just a moment. Excuse me!

00:24:07.822 --> 00:24:08.698
Excuse me.

00:24:09.824 --> 00:24:12.118
We're the police.
We need your attention, please.

00:24:12.201 --> 00:24:14.579
This place is currently at risk
of a terrorist attack.

00:24:14.662 --> 00:24:17.874
-Please evacuate immediately!
-Terrorist attack, my ass.

00:24:17.957 --> 00:24:20.793
Who the hell are you?
Do you even know what's taking place here?

00:24:20.877 --> 00:24:22.837
Everyone must evacuate immediately!

00:24:23.588 --> 00:24:26.132
We need your cooperation
to avoid any accidents.

00:24:26.215 --> 00:24:28.885
Hold on. Aren't you that guy from before?

00:24:28.968 --> 00:24:31.053
That's not what matters right now!

00:24:31.137 --> 00:24:32.638
-Ladies first.
-This isn't a drill.

00:24:32.722 --> 00:24:34.140
You need to get out now!

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:36.851
Please begin.

00:24:38.519 --> 00:24:40.521
You need to get out now!

00:24:44.859 --> 00:24:46.944
-What's happening?
-Damn it.

00:24:47.028 --> 00:24:49.572
VICTORY HOTEL
SPECIAL SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING

00:25:09.592 --> 00:25:11.510
Damn it! Get out now!

00:25:11.594 --> 00:25:12.720
Leave now. Hurry!

00:25:12.803 --> 00:25:13.888
Crouch down!

00:25:13.971 --> 00:25:15.765
People are coming this way,
so make room for them.

00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:17.266
Hurry up!

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:19.894
This way!

00:25:20.394 --> 00:25:21.395
Over here!

00:25:25.566 --> 00:25:27.652
Hurry and exit this way!

00:25:27.735 --> 00:25:29.695
Stay calm! Don't push!

00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:33.199
Hurry, everyone!
Stay calm and exit carefully!

00:25:34.784 --> 00:25:37.328
Please help this person. Excuse me!

00:25:50.967 --> 00:25:52.343
Please come this way.

00:25:52.426 --> 00:25:54.136
Please exit calmly!

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.055
Stay calm and don't push!

00:26:10.861 --> 00:26:12.446
Cover your mouth and exit one at a time!

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.865
-Stay calm!
-Don't push!

00:26:26.335 --> 00:26:27.378
Let's go.

00:26:29.088 --> 00:26:31.340
Please stay calm!

00:26:31.924 --> 00:26:32.925
Stay calm!

00:26:34.593 --> 00:26:35.720
This way!

00:26:35.803 --> 00:26:36.846
Stay calm!

00:26:43.436 --> 00:26:44.895
Keep moving forward!

00:26:52.486 --> 00:26:55.072
Hold on. Why can't they go out?

00:26:55.156 --> 00:26:56.282
Excuse me!

00:26:56.365 --> 00:26:58.409
The entrance is blocked! Hold on a second!

00:26:59.327 --> 00:27:02.288
Please excuse me!

00:27:03.205 --> 00:27:04.915
-Jae-hong!
-The door!

00:27:04.999 --> 00:27:06.584
-What's going on?
-The door's locked!

00:27:07.126 --> 00:27:08.294
Where's the captain?

00:27:16.844 --> 00:27:18.179
Move!

00:27:19.805 --> 00:27:21.724
Make way, please.

00:27:21.807 --> 00:27:22.641
Move out of the way!

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:42.328
Dung-ju, are you okay? You damn idiot.

00:27:42.411 --> 00:27:44.455
Jeez, seriously.

00:27:47.375 --> 00:27:48.918
Just a moment!

00:27:49.001 --> 00:27:50.836
Please wait a moment!

00:27:51.754 --> 00:27:53.255
It can't be exposed to water.

00:27:53.339 --> 00:27:54.673
Water?

00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:56.675
The emergency stairwell.

00:27:56.759 --> 00:28:00.137
Head to the emergency stairwell!
There are no sprinklers there!

00:28:00.721 --> 00:28:02.098
One person at a time!

00:28:02.181 --> 00:28:04.350
Slowly, please.

00:28:04.433 --> 00:28:06.644
-Don't run.
-Come out slowly.

00:28:06.727 --> 00:28:09.522
-Good.
-Follow them out.

00:28:09.605 --> 00:28:10.606
Don't run.

00:28:10.689 --> 00:28:12.400
Sergeant Kim, where's the captain?

00:28:13.401 --> 00:28:14.610
Captain.

00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:16.070
Captain!

00:28:16.153 --> 00:28:18.614
Oh, it's hot!

00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:20.199
What am I going to do?

00:28:20.282 --> 00:28:21.409
-Captain!
-It's hot!

00:28:21.492 --> 00:28:23.494
-I can't…
-Captain.

00:28:24.203 --> 00:28:25.329
Are you okay?

00:28:25.413 --> 00:28:27.123
-Take me somewhere quiet.
-Okay.

00:28:28.124 --> 00:28:29.375
Come down slowly, please.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.585
-Don't run.
-Hurry up!

00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:33.963
One person at a time.

00:28:34.046 --> 00:28:35.506
In orderly fashion!

00:28:35.589 --> 00:28:37.216
One person at a time, please.

00:28:37.299 --> 00:28:39.927
Send fire engines now!
Everyone's about to die here!

00:28:40.010 --> 00:28:42.054
I don't give a shit!
Do something, you bastard!

00:28:42.138 --> 00:28:43.222
What are you doing? Move it!

00:28:43.305 --> 00:28:44.723
-Let us out!
-Move!

00:28:44.807 --> 00:28:46.475
Everyone, shut up!

00:28:47.309 --> 00:28:50.771
You're so-called leaders!
You should act with more dignity!

00:28:52.648 --> 00:28:56.318
Please exit slowly one at a time
when I ask nicely, okay?

00:28:56.402 --> 00:28:57.403
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:28:57.486 --> 00:28:58.946
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

00:28:59.697 --> 00:29:01.240
-One person at a time.
-Thank you, sir.

00:29:01.323 --> 00:29:02.700
Very nice. Just like that.

00:29:02.783 --> 00:29:04.410
See how nice this is?

00:29:04.493 --> 00:29:05.911
Very good.

00:29:05.995 --> 00:29:08.038
Go slowly. One at a time.

00:29:08.122 --> 00:29:09.123
Is everyone out?

00:29:10.332 --> 00:29:12.209
-And the people in front?
-They're all out.

00:29:12.918 --> 00:29:13.919
Captain.

00:29:14.628 --> 00:29:16.630
-Everyone's out.
-Good.

00:29:17.756 --> 00:29:20.092
-Did we save everyone?
-Yes, we did.

00:29:21.677 --> 00:29:22.678
What's wrong with him?

00:29:36.567 --> 00:29:37.568
Hold on a second!

00:29:37.651 --> 00:29:38.903
Just a moment!

00:29:41.155 --> 00:29:43.199
Excuse me!

00:29:44.033 --> 00:29:46.410
-Please make way.
-Don't panic. Please wait a moment.

00:29:47.661 --> 00:29:48.829
Please maintain order.

00:29:50.789 --> 00:29:53.542
It's going to explode again.

00:29:53.626 --> 00:29:55.044
-It'll explode!
-No, it won't.

00:29:55.127 --> 00:29:56.962
Please calm down and hang in there.

00:29:57.046 --> 00:29:58.797
I requested backup,
so they'll be here soon.

00:29:59.507 --> 00:30:00.633
Who did you request?

00:30:20.653 --> 00:30:23.447
Everyone, please move back a bit.

00:30:23.531 --> 00:30:26.283
Please don't push and don't panic.
Just take a step back.

00:30:26.367 --> 00:30:28.244
Be careful. Let's move back a bit.

00:30:49.932 --> 00:30:52.142
I'm the commissioner
of the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency…

00:30:52.226 --> 00:30:53.686
How did that guy get here?

00:30:54.311 --> 00:30:55.854
I told you backup was coming.

00:30:55.938 --> 00:30:57.356
How did you coax him?

00:30:59.066 --> 00:31:00.109
It was Yoon Dong-ju's doing.

00:31:02.611 --> 00:31:04.196
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.282
I'll give you a chance.

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:07.575
A chance?

00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:16.792
A chance to prove
that you're not an incompetent coward

00:31:16.875 --> 00:31:18.043
or a spineless weasel.

00:31:18.711 --> 00:31:20.296
When Senior Officer Ji calls you,

00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:22.756
consider it your last chance
and answer her.

00:31:23.382 --> 00:31:24.508
We're at the Victory Hotel.

00:31:26.427 --> 00:31:29.221
You'll be rescuing people
who are in danger.

00:31:29.805 --> 00:31:31.307
This is how you'll be remembered.

00:31:31.890 --> 00:31:33.559
Commissioner Cho Pan-yeol,

00:31:33.642 --> 00:31:35.394
the brave hero who stood up to crime

00:31:35.936 --> 00:31:37.521
and saved the citizens of Insung.

00:31:38.272 --> 00:31:41.317
Good, now let's have the ladies
step forward first.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.526
Watch your step.

00:31:42.610 --> 00:31:44.486
The spineless weasel made himself useful.

00:31:45.446 --> 00:31:46.447
Good.

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:48.240
He can take care of this place.

00:31:48.324 --> 00:31:50.618
Let's go catch that bastard Min Ju-yeong.

00:31:51.201 --> 00:31:52.411
Very good!

00:31:52.494 --> 00:31:55.289
Respected citizens of Insung.

00:31:55.372 --> 00:31:58.000
Insung City

00:31:58.083 --> 00:32:00.878
is currently under serious threat
from crime.

00:32:03.339 --> 00:32:06.342
I, Commissioner Cho Pan-yeol
of the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency,

00:32:07.092 --> 00:32:10.387
can no longer stand by and watch.

00:32:11.639 --> 00:32:13.098
It is my final and most important duty

00:32:13.724 --> 00:32:16.018
to eradicate crime
and restore order in the city

00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:20.648
so that every Insung citizen
can live without fear.

00:32:21.899 --> 00:32:24.234
And I, Cho Pan-yeol,

00:32:25.402 --> 00:32:27.279
intend to fulfill this duty

00:32:27.363 --> 00:32:30.324
and promise to see it through to the end.

00:32:32.618 --> 00:32:34.912
All police officers
will be armed and ready

00:32:35.746 --> 00:32:39.875
to confront crime and violence head-on.

00:32:41.377 --> 00:32:45.422
I won't rest until the citizens of Insung

00:32:46.048 --> 00:32:49.385
are free from anxiety and fear.

00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:52.721
For the safety of all Insung citizens,

00:32:53.555 --> 00:32:57.685
I will take any and all
extraordinary measures necessary.

00:33:06.568 --> 00:33:08.153
As of this moment,

00:33:08.987 --> 00:33:10.614
the Insung Metropolitan Police Agency

00:33:11.198 --> 00:33:12.950
is taking a stand

00:33:13.534 --> 00:33:19.039
against lawlessness, corruption, disorder,
and violence threatening our city,

00:33:20.624 --> 00:33:23.919
and we hereby declare war on crime!

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.964
Took you long enough, you dumb bastard.

00:33:27.047 --> 00:33:28.173
It's about damn time.

00:33:29.133 --> 00:33:32.094
Every street rat
will get arrested at this rate.

00:33:33.095 --> 00:33:35.472
Every rat has an escape hole.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:39.268
-What?
-Did you say you knew

00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:40.644
all the stowaway vessels?

00:33:41.145 --> 00:33:42.271
Top to bottom?

00:33:42.354 --> 00:33:44.773
I've got them all mapped out,
top to bottom.

00:33:44.857 --> 00:33:46.984
What about vessels being sold overseas?

00:33:47.526 --> 00:33:48.819
Have you looked into those?

00:33:48.902 --> 00:33:50.320
Top to bottom?

00:33:51.113 --> 00:33:53.699
Let's block every single possible way out.

00:33:55.075 --> 00:33:56.410
What are you waiting for? Look them up.

00:33:56.994 --> 00:33:58.787
Vessels being sold overseas?

00:33:58.871 --> 00:34:01.331
We got word that Min Ju-yeong's vehicle
is speeding down the road

00:34:01.415 --> 00:34:02.416
near Insung Motors.

00:34:02.499 --> 00:34:04.001
Repeat, he's fleeing at high speed.

00:34:04.877 --> 00:34:06.503
We're preparing to open fire.

00:34:06.587 --> 00:34:08.088
Requesting civilian lockdown in the area.

00:34:15.804 --> 00:34:16.805
Let her through.

00:34:28.233 --> 00:34:29.318
That's right. Keep running.

00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:31.653
If you stop, you're dead.

00:34:52.591 --> 00:34:53.467
Catch that bastard!

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:56.345
He's mine! I'm going to catch him!

00:34:56.428 --> 00:34:57.429
Go ahead!

00:35:01.016 --> 00:35:02.392
Min Ju-yeong isn't here.

00:35:04.228 --> 00:35:08.398
A black Merce, possibly Min Ju-yeong's,
with the license plate number 70B 1632.

00:35:08.482 --> 00:35:10.818
We've confirmed
it's on the Insung coastal highway.

00:35:11.485 --> 00:35:13.570
We found him. He's in a black Merce.

00:35:13.654 --> 00:35:14.947
Plate number 70B 1632.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.241
Got it.

00:35:18.867 --> 00:35:20.244
70B 1632, BLACK

00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:22.830
BALD EAGLE

00:35:22.913 --> 00:35:23.914
Did you find it?

00:35:23.997 --> 00:35:26.208
There's a Russian vessel
leaving Jinseong Port today.

00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:28.418
Get over there now.
The bastard's escaping today!

00:35:28.502 --> 00:35:30.003
You have to move fast!

00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:41.390
POLICE CHECKPOINT

00:36:19.011 --> 00:36:20.470
I'll destroy every last thing…

00:36:25.267 --> 00:36:26.435
with my own hands.

00:36:43.076 --> 00:36:45.746
-What in the world?
-My goodness.

00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:48.248
Somebody will get hurt.

00:36:50.709 --> 00:36:52.753
Move!

00:37:15.525 --> 00:37:16.860
You bastard.

00:37:44.388 --> 00:37:46.139
Hey, you've got some skills.

00:37:48.225 --> 00:37:49.810
Were you an athlete? So was I.

00:37:49.893 --> 00:37:51.103
You could say that.

00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.647
Speak Korean, you bastard!

00:38:05.701 --> 00:38:07.786
He definitely trained as an athlete.

00:38:09.121 --> 00:38:10.205
Hey!

00:38:38.108 --> 00:38:39.443
Min Ju-yeong.

00:38:39.526 --> 00:38:42.571
There's a pretty big bounty on your head.

00:38:42.654 --> 00:38:44.281
I'm afraid you'll need to come with us.

00:38:44.948 --> 00:38:46.783
Hey, grab the bastard.

00:38:46.867 --> 00:38:48.660
He's our ticket to big bucks.

00:38:48.744 --> 00:38:49.578
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

00:39:14.436 --> 00:39:15.437
We're the police.

00:39:31.036 --> 00:39:32.287
We have to find him fast

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.164
before the bastard
throws another curveball.

00:40:10.283 --> 00:40:11.493
He must be nearby.

00:40:12.077 --> 00:40:13.078
Let's look.

00:40:35.058 --> 00:40:36.059
What?

00:40:36.852 --> 00:40:38.145
Let's wait a bit.

00:40:39.479 --> 00:40:41.106
Right, let's save our energy.

00:40:44.276 --> 00:40:45.277
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

00:41:02.502 --> 00:41:03.837
Who the hell are you two?

00:41:11.136 --> 00:41:12.387
We'll be taking this guy.

00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:17.309
Hey, that bastard is ours.

00:41:18.351 --> 00:41:20.562
Apparently, there's a bounty on my head.

00:41:22.063 --> 00:41:23.148
Too bad though.

00:41:28.403 --> 00:41:29.321
You bastard.

00:41:29.905 --> 00:41:32.073
You don't get to die so easily.

00:41:33.074 --> 00:41:34.117
You can't die.

00:41:36.578 --> 00:41:38.747
I'm going to save you
and drag your ass to jail.

00:41:47.130 --> 00:41:47.964
Kill them!

00:42:04.272 --> 00:42:05.273
Min Ju-yeong!

00:42:21.998 --> 00:42:22.999
Go after him.

00:42:50.902 --> 00:42:51.945
Get away from me!

00:42:52.028 --> 00:42:53.655
Stay away!

00:42:55.615 --> 00:42:57.409
Don't you dare come near me.

00:42:59.244 --> 00:43:00.245
Hey.

00:43:01.955 --> 00:43:04.040
You were a professional wrestler,
weren't you?

00:43:05.333 --> 00:43:06.418
Were chokeholds your specialty?

00:43:06.501 --> 00:43:08.336
I can tell just by looking at your moves.

00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:09.546
But if that's the case,

00:43:10.297 --> 00:43:12.465
then you must know who I am.

00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:14.301
Go Man-sik, 2008 Mumbai,

00:43:14.884 --> 00:43:16.052
bronze medalist.

00:43:16.678 --> 00:43:18.096
Do you know what my nickname was?

00:43:30.066 --> 00:43:31.151
"The Slippery Eel."

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:34.237
What a lunatic.

00:43:34.321 --> 00:43:36.614
A slippery eel thrashing on the mat.

00:43:37.198 --> 00:43:39.659
A ridiculously fit one too.

00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.288
That was my nickname.

00:43:43.371 --> 00:43:44.414
You'd better remember that.

00:43:46.708 --> 00:43:47.709
Come on.

00:43:48.752 --> 00:43:49.836
Bring it.

00:43:51.296 --> 00:43:52.297
Come at me!

00:44:45.558 --> 00:44:46.559
Damn it.

00:44:51.106 --> 00:44:52.190
Hey, Min Ju-yeong!

00:44:52.816 --> 00:44:54.150
You fucking bastard!

00:44:54.234 --> 00:44:55.610
Where are you going? Did you forget--

00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:58.613
You son of a bitch!

00:45:01.199 --> 00:45:02.492
Your head is mine!

00:45:09.707 --> 00:45:11.376
Both of you are mine.

00:45:12.836 --> 00:45:13.920
Let's go.

00:45:15.213 --> 00:45:16.548
That little mutt is at it again.

00:45:16.631 --> 00:45:17.966
Kill him!

00:45:55.962 --> 00:45:58.131
Where do you think you're going,
son of a bitch?

00:45:58.798 --> 00:45:59.966
You asshole.

00:46:02.218 --> 00:46:05.513
You used me too many times.
Now it's time to pay with your life!

00:46:10.059 --> 00:46:12.645
You little shit.
You're messing with me too?

00:46:12.729 --> 00:46:13.730
Screw you!

00:46:15.815 --> 00:46:17.567
Hey, you bastard!

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:18.651
Come here.

00:46:22.238 --> 00:46:23.740
You fucking asshole!

00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:26.075
Goddammit!

00:46:26.159 --> 00:46:27.410
Come at me!

00:46:30.663 --> 00:46:31.748
Fuck you!

00:47:19.837 --> 00:47:23.216
I'm a bronze medalist in the discus throw!

00:47:23.883 --> 00:47:26.219
Please don't do this! Spare me!

00:47:32.475 --> 00:47:34.102
I hold my own in terms of strength.

00:47:34.686 --> 00:47:35.687
You know why?

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:38.481
Because I'm a Korean dad
with a house full of kids.

00:48:04.507 --> 00:48:05.967
Damn it, that's gross!

00:48:08.303 --> 00:48:09.512
Come here.

00:48:40.293 --> 00:48:42.587
Damn you, you little shit!

00:48:55.808 --> 00:48:58.353
Goddammit. I can't get up now.

00:48:58.436 --> 00:48:59.395
Baek Seok-chun.

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:01.481
You are…

00:49:06.778 --> 00:49:07.862
Hey, that hurts.

00:49:12.617 --> 00:49:13.701
…under arrest.

00:49:15.286 --> 00:49:16.454
WAVE

00:49:20.291 --> 00:49:21.876
You're dead, you bastard.

00:49:39.852 --> 00:49:41.229
You just won't quit, huh?

00:49:43.064 --> 00:49:44.357
Damn it!

00:49:44.941 --> 00:49:45.775
Hey.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:57.245
What kind of life have you lived
that you kill someone like it's nothing?

00:50:00.415 --> 00:50:01.624
Who do you mean?

00:50:03.251 --> 00:50:04.585
Oh, that woman.

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:08.715
Is she dead?

00:50:13.511 --> 00:50:14.637
Oh, no.

00:50:16.139 --> 00:50:18.057
That hurts my heart a little.

00:50:18.975 --> 00:50:20.476
She was a good person.

00:50:22.186 --> 00:50:23.020
What?

00:50:24.689 --> 00:50:26.065
It hurts your heart a little?

00:50:27.316 --> 00:50:28.317
Yeah.

00:50:29.318 --> 00:50:33.030
It hurts a little like it did
when my parents died a long time ago.

00:50:34.073 --> 00:50:36.159
And when Mr. Lee Jin-su died.

00:50:37.201 --> 00:50:40.246
And I guess when your blonde friend
committed suicide.

00:50:48.838 --> 00:50:50.131
Don't say another word

00:50:50.923 --> 00:50:52.467
because I might kill you.

00:50:54.969 --> 00:50:55.887
Why?

00:50:56.471 --> 00:50:58.139
I thought you wanted to know
how I lived my life.

00:51:00.183 --> 00:51:01.934
Don't make pathetic excuses.

00:51:03.644 --> 00:51:04.854
A scumbag like you

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.023
doesn't get to make excuses.

00:51:08.649 --> 00:51:09.692
"I was uneducated."

00:51:12.737 --> 00:51:14.113
"Life was too hard."

00:51:17.074 --> 00:51:18.576
"I wasn't loved as a child."

00:51:24.832 --> 00:51:26.793
Save that bullshit for your lawyer.

00:51:29.128 --> 00:51:30.463
You have nowhere to run,

00:51:31.798 --> 00:51:33.299
no second in your corner to help you,

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.302
and no referee to step in
even if you get beaten to death.

00:51:39.806 --> 00:51:40.807
So get ready.

00:51:43.184 --> 00:51:44.393
It's the final round.

00:51:49.357 --> 00:51:50.525
You'd better bite down.

00:51:52.652 --> 00:51:54.654
You can't testify to the judge
with a broken jaw.

00:52:20.721 --> 00:52:21.973
That's enough.

00:52:22.974 --> 00:52:23.975
Now look up at the sky.

00:52:46.831 --> 00:52:48.124
What?

00:52:48.749 --> 00:52:50.167
You think you won?

00:52:53.629 --> 00:52:54.797
Hey!

00:53:01.095 --> 00:53:02.638
You've got to be kidding me!

00:54:36.565 --> 00:54:39.151
I'm glad Ha-min and Ha-jun
taught me how to swim.

00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:41.153
Goddammit.

00:54:41.737 --> 00:54:43.280
I almost drowned!

00:54:50.538 --> 00:54:52.665
Korean trash

00:54:53.249 --> 00:54:56.127
is for Korean civil servants to clean up.

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:59.213
GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL ID
YOON DONG-JU

00:55:11.225 --> 00:55:12.351
Dong-ju!

00:55:13.728 --> 00:55:14.770
Min Ju-yeong!

00:55:14.854 --> 00:55:15.896
You bastard!

00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:23.821
It's snowing.

00:55:37.126 --> 00:55:38.586
Han-na!

00:55:40.713 --> 00:55:42.339
Oh, my. What in the world?

00:55:42.882 --> 00:55:45.885
This place is a mess!

00:55:46.510 --> 00:55:49.805
My goodness.
Who do you take after to be this messy?

00:55:49.889 --> 00:55:52.391
-Why are you here so early?
-What's this?

00:55:52.475 --> 00:55:54.769
Are these your pants? Goodness.

00:55:54.852 --> 00:55:56.520
Clean up your own place.

00:55:57.396 --> 00:55:58.230
Wait.

00:55:58.856 --> 00:55:59.732
Oh, my.

00:56:00.483 --> 00:56:02.276
-Wait, whose--
-Seriously!

00:56:04.195 --> 00:56:05.196
SHINE MUSCAT

00:56:10.534 --> 00:56:11.535
You go first.

00:56:12.244 --> 00:56:13.120
What do you mean?

00:56:13.204 --> 00:56:14.830
Tell me about the man you're seeing.

00:56:15.706 --> 00:56:16.916
Does he own a fruit store?

00:56:16.999 --> 00:56:19.543
Not a fruit store. He owns an orchard.

00:56:23.756 --> 00:56:26.759
So when do I get to meet him?

00:56:28.094 --> 00:56:29.011
What?

00:56:29.095 --> 00:56:31.597
If you like him, keep seeing him.
I'm fine with it.

00:56:35.017 --> 00:56:36.018
I mean it.

00:56:37.019 --> 00:56:38.020
Han-na.

00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:42.942
Who knew a day like this would come?

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.028
He's not like the other men I used to see.

00:56:46.112 --> 00:56:48.364
I don't focus on looks anymore.

00:56:48.447 --> 00:56:50.574
This man cherishes me

00:56:50.658 --> 00:56:52.701
and has a very warm heart.

00:56:52.785 --> 00:56:54.620
I'm sure you'll like him
when you meet him.

00:56:56.455 --> 00:56:58.874
-Set a date so we can all meet up.
-Really?

00:57:00.584 --> 00:57:01.919
I'll call him right away.

00:57:04.004 --> 00:57:05.381
I'm seeing someone

00:57:05.464 --> 00:57:08.092
who cherishes me and has a warm heart.

00:57:08.926 --> 00:57:11.053
And he's good-looking.

00:57:12.263 --> 00:57:14.014
Is it really him? Is it Dong-ju?

00:57:14.807 --> 00:57:15.808
Yeah.

00:57:18.894 --> 00:57:19.895
But…

00:57:21.689 --> 00:57:23.899
Is he really okay now?

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.359
How is he?

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.321
Well…

00:57:37.371 --> 00:57:38.372
He's the same as always.

00:57:40.958 --> 00:57:42.918
-I'm here.
-Oh, hey.

00:57:43.669 --> 00:57:45.296
-Have you eaten yet?
-No.

00:57:47.089 --> 00:57:49.925
-Is that you, Han-na?
-Yes. How've you been?

00:57:50.009 --> 00:57:52.094
I'm too healthy for my own good.

00:57:52.178 --> 00:57:53.512
Mom, try this.

00:57:53.596 --> 00:57:54.513
Okay.

00:57:55.097 --> 00:57:56.056
Open wide.

00:57:59.018 --> 00:58:00.978
Looks like my son
can open his own gimbap shop.

00:58:01.061 --> 00:58:02.146
It's seasoned perfectly.

00:58:02.229 --> 00:58:03.480
That's good.

00:58:04.064 --> 00:58:06.650
You two stay here.
I'm going to the market.

00:58:06.734 --> 00:58:08.527
-See you later.
-See you.

00:58:10.196 --> 00:58:11.322
-Give me one too.
-Okay.

00:58:12.573 --> 00:58:13.782
Open wide.

00:58:16.285 --> 00:58:17.286
It's good, right?

00:58:17.369 --> 00:58:19.121
Yeah, it's good.

00:58:19.205 --> 00:58:20.247
Of course, it is.

00:58:20.331 --> 00:58:22.583
This is a special gimbap
made just for you.

00:58:23.959 --> 00:58:25.461
Did you go get physical therapy?

00:58:26.295 --> 00:58:28.380
Of course. See? I'm fine now.

00:58:32.635 --> 00:58:34.053
Hey, what's that?

00:58:36.472 --> 00:58:38.641
Oh, that's for someone else.

00:58:41.101 --> 00:58:42.102
I have to go.

00:58:42.186 --> 00:58:43.771
Already? Have another one.

00:58:47.024 --> 00:58:48.275
-See you later.
-Okay.

00:58:56.242 --> 00:58:57.368
Don't be late, okay?

00:58:57.451 --> 00:58:59.328
Okay, I won't be late.

00:59:00.037 --> 00:59:01.121
Take your lunchbox.

00:59:03.332 --> 00:59:04.375
-See you later.
-Bye.

00:59:10.256 --> 00:59:12.049
-Mr. Yoon Dong-ju?
-Yes?

00:59:12.633 --> 00:59:14.718
Oh, hello. I'll leave this here.

00:59:14.802 --> 00:59:17.221
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

I'm returning to work soon.

00:59:54.967 --> 00:59:56.260
I even got promoted, thanks to you.

00:59:58.512 --> 00:59:59.513
Did you come to brag?

00:59:59.596 --> 01:00:00.514
Yeah.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.683
I thought you should know.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.188
It's hard in here, isn't it?

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:09.982
You don't look so good.

01:00:10.065 --> 01:00:13.569
The food here isn't exactly to my liking.

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:17.740
Even so, you'll be eating it
for the rest of your life.

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:18.866
You need to get used to it.

01:00:18.949 --> 01:00:21.827
If you're that worried,
then get me some outside food.

01:00:22.870 --> 01:00:24.204
I actually brought you some.

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:27.666
I woke up at dawn today

01:00:29.084 --> 01:00:30.669
and prepared this for you.

01:00:30.753 --> 01:00:33.714
So make sure to chew carefully
and eat every bit of it.

01:00:52.733 --> 01:00:54.902
Did you reflect on your actions
while looking at the sky?

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:58.906
Do you think you're a hero
because you put me here?

01:01:03.786 --> 01:01:06.497
Don't think it's all over
just because I'm gone.

01:01:07.623 --> 01:01:10.876
Do you know how many people
I've financially supported

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:14.004
before they made it
as judges and prosecutors?

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.804
Where do you think they are right now?

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:27.184
As long as money and greed exist,

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:29.686
the world will never change.

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:32.856
You see, people like me are everywhere.

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:36.193
Don't worry.

01:01:38.070 --> 01:01:39.822
If someone like you turns up again…

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:43.909
someone like me
will do exactly what I did to you.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:47.413
They'll run themselves into the ground

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.707
to catch criminals
and throw them behind bars.

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:54.962
It doesn't matter if there are
dozens, hundreds, or thousands of them.

01:01:59.091 --> 01:01:59.925
You see…

01:02:01.844 --> 01:02:02.886
a scum like you…

01:02:05.139 --> 01:02:07.641
makes our blood boil from deep within.

01:02:15.274 --> 01:02:17.651
I'll be out soon.
Let's have a meal together then.

01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:53.562
"PROLOGUE"
BY YOON DONG-JU

01:04:16.144 --> 01:04:17.563
About face!

01:04:17.646 --> 01:04:19.731
MEDAL AWARD CEREMONY
HONORING THE HEROES OF INSUNG

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:21.608
Everyone!

01:04:21.692 --> 01:04:23.569
-Salute!
-Salute!

01:04:28.699 --> 01:04:30.325
There was a time…

01:04:41.503 --> 01:04:44.464
when we felt our hearts burn and scream
as if they were ready to explode.

01:04:45.257 --> 01:04:46.550
Why are you doing this again?

01:04:47.134 --> 01:04:48.594
Why walk away from your fine career?

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:53.849
Up until now,

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:56.143
only two choices in my life
were truly mine.

01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:58.645
I gave up on one.

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:02.566
But this…

01:05:03.317 --> 01:05:04.401
Prêts? Allez.

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:06.278
I don't want to give this up.

01:05:06.862 --> 01:05:07.863
It's okay if I lose.

01:05:07.946 --> 01:05:09.448
But I can't handle having regrets.

01:05:10.782 --> 01:05:12.242
But once the spotlights go out,

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:14.411
the heroes are forgotten…

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:17.414
How long are you going to make me
Do this happy shoulder dance?

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:18.457
INSUNG METROPOLITAN POLICE AGENCY

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.000
My shoulders feel heavy!

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:21.376
Gosh, the responsibility!

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:23.462
…along with the memories
of those fiery days.

01:05:23.962 --> 01:05:25.297
They might get dislocated!

01:05:27.716 --> 01:05:30.010
What? My vasectomy didn't work?

01:05:31.178 --> 01:05:33.180
But I thought it was permanent.

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:35.891
It happens sometimes.

01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:42.022
Honey.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.900
Did you think it wasn't yours?

01:05:44.983 --> 01:05:46.777
No, of course not.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:49.112
I never once doubted you.

01:05:49.196 --> 01:05:52.074
I was just surprised, that's all.

01:05:52.157 --> 01:05:54.910
Hey there, little one.

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:57.287
When everyone burned with passion,

01:05:58.538 --> 01:05:59.539
we were…

01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:04.544
heroes.

01:06:20.394 --> 01:06:23.980
Han-na, you agreed not to go for the head!

01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:27.526
Sorry.

01:06:32.072 --> 01:06:33.281
But remember…

01:06:36.243 --> 01:06:37.369
that our hearts…

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:40.956
continue to burn and scream…

01:06:42.457 --> 01:06:44.209
as if they're ready to explode.

01:06:56.054 --> 01:06:57.723
You're getting a younger sibling.

01:06:57.806 --> 01:06:59.057
Yes!

01:06:59.141 --> 01:07:01.935
-All right, a little sibling!
-Yes! You're an older sister now!

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:02.978
Thank you!

the day…

01:07:37.429 --> 01:07:38.889
…when everyone…

01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:41.808
burned with passion.

01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:00.368
Your hair has gotten longer
compared to before.

01:08:00.452 --> 01:08:01.953
No, it was long back then too.

01:08:03.538 --> 01:08:06.541
Steamed Bun!

01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:16.051
LAUGHS FOR NO REASON

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:17.135
(DON'T LAUGH)

01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:18.220
Jae-hong…

01:08:18.804 --> 01:08:20.514
DON'T YOU HAVE ANY LINES, HAN-NA?

01:08:21.223 --> 01:08:23.016
I GUESS NOT…

01:08:23.809 --> 01:08:24.851
I'll walk you home.

01:08:25.352 --> 01:08:26.436
No.

01:08:26.978 --> 01:08:27.979
I'm sorry!

01:08:30.982 --> 01:08:32.025
-Captain!
-Captain!

01:08:43.078 --> 01:08:44.621
