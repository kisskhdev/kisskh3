WEBVTT

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:22.839
It's really President Zhou.

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:23.879
How is that possible?

00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:26.120
Why would President Zhou come down in person?

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:31.160
Impressive.

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.799
You must be from Qingmu Group,

00:00:35.799 --> 00:00:37.119
President Su, Su Qingyan, right?

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:38.439
I've heard so much about you.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.840
Your reputation precedes you.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.039
President Zhou, you're too kind.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:43.079
You are...

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.439
What else could it be?

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:45.759
Of course, I'm here to welcome you.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.240
Really here to welcome her?

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.920
Why Su Qingyan?

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.200
To welcome me?

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.840
Are you sure you haven't made a mistake?

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:53.000
No mistake.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.159
Absolutely no mistake.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.399
I came here especially for you.

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:57.719
President Su, your presence here

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.679
truly makes our

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.719
Tiange Group shine with honor.

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:02.679
No, no, no.

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:03.640
You're too polite.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.840
Actually, I came today

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.359
to discuss a project with you.

00:01:07.519 --> 00:01:08.599
A project?

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:09.239
No problem.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.239
Absolutely no problem.

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.079
Then let's not stand here.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.480
Let's go to the VIP lounge.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.959
We can sit down, eat, and talk.

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:18.359
Does this arrangement work for you?

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:20.560
Honey,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.840
let's give him some face.

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:22.879
Let's go in and have a seat.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.680
Alright, alright.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.439
Please, both of you.

00:01:32.239 --> 00:01:32.840
Please.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.640
Please.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.480
I didn't expect Mr. Zhou from Tiange Group

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.840
to be so easy to talk to.

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:58.040
I have to do my best today.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.239
I want to secure this investment.

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:00.280
No need to fight for it.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.480
Just speak up.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.680
I don't believe Zhou Pengfei would dare refuse.

00:02:04.519 --> 00:02:05.599
Keep your voice down.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.960
It's because Mr. Zhou is approachable.

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.919
Do you really think it's because we're important?

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.719
Yes.

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:12.319
Hey.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.719
In a bit,

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:15.520
you absolutely must not say anything inappropriate.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.360
Did you hear me?

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.680
I heard you.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.280
Rule number two,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.520
I have to follow your lead in everything I say and do.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.280
Mm-hmm.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.080
As long as you know.

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:25.280
I've remembered.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.240
Don't say anything out of line.

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:31.719
Please come inside.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.080
Mr. Gao, President Su

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.280
Please, both of you, take the main seats.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.039
President Zhou, you are the host.

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:47.039
We are the guests.

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.719
You should take the main seat.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:48.919
No, no, that won't do.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:49.639
Absolutely not.

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:50.719
You sit, you sit.

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:51.560
No, no, President Zhou.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.199
It's really not appropriate.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.120
It should still be you.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.680
How about this:

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:54.759
You three sit first.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.000
Otherwise, my wife won't sit.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.479
Alright.

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.560
Come on.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.439
Isn't this inappropriate?

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:02.759
Sit.

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.319
President Zhou, I really think it's not appropriate.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:12.039
You should still take the seat.

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.639
No, no.

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.520
President Su, it has to be you.

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:16.120
Honey,

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.960
Just sit down.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.560
Otherwise, we won't be able to eat.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.960
Alright.

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.120
Please sit.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.879
Come, sit.

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.280
Let me introduce everyone.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.840
This is my husband.

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:35.360
You can just call him Xiao Gao.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.960
Gao Xing.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.280
Quick, greet the bosses.

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.840
Hello, everyone.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.479
Hello, Mr. Gao. Hello, Mr. Gao.

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:43.280
No, no, President Zhou.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.159
You're being too polite.

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.199
Please, sit down.

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.840
What are you doing?

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.280
What are you standing there for?

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.759
Hurry up and serve tea to the bosses.

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.840
Oh, okay.

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.919
Mr. Su, Mr. Su.

00:03:57.919 --> 00:03:58.840
No, no, that's not necessary.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.840
We can do it ourselves.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.840
Mr. Zhou, don't worry about it.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.479
Let him do it.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:02.280
Let him do it.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.240
Mr. Su said so.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.080
I'll do it.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.120
You all sit down.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.479
Sit.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.599
Yes.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.199
Please have a seat.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.599
President Zhou

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.199
Yes?

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.879
Actually, the reason I came this time is

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:19.319
Qingmu has a project that we'd like to collaborate on with Tiange Group.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.680
This is the project proposal.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:22.639
Please take a look.

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:23.160
Alright, thank you.

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:24.519
Okay, I'll look at it right away.

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:27.160
Please, have a seat.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.439
You have to look at the proposal?

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.680
President Zhou, do you not trust Qingmu?

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:34.480
No, no.

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:35.439
Please, sit. I just—

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:36.199
I'm happy.

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:37.560
President Zhou, sorry about that.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.000
Please, sit, sit.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.639
I just—

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:39.839
He doesn't know any better.

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:40.839
He's just joking.

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:41.800
Please don't take it to heart.

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.439
No, no, it's—

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.439
Mr. Gao is right.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.680
I was being careless.

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:45.240
Oh dear.

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:47.040
President Su's ability and character

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.000
I absolutely trust.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.839
There's no need to look at the proposal.

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:52.319
Tiange will definitely cooperate.

00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:55.360
We—we agree.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.480
We—we agree.

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:57.600
Of course we agree.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.839
President Su, about how much will this project need?

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.839
Just name your price.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.360
Mr. Zhou

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:10.720
Our project still needs thirty million in investment.

00:05:11.079 --> 00:05:11.959
Ah, no,

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:13.720
twenty, twenty million will do.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:14.639
What do you think?

00:05:15.519 --> 00:05:16.319
No problem.

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:17.279
Of course, no problem.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.040
Just, just,

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.879
just thirty million.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.839
A big company like Tiange only offers thirty million?

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:23.079
Are you treating us like beggars?

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:24.279
Didn't I tell you before?

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:25.000
Don't speak carelessly.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.480
No, no,

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.160
Mr. Zhou, that's not what he meant.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.959
Sit.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.399
Mr. Su

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.040
Mr. Gao is right.

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:33.759
Thirty million really is too little.

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.759
How about this:

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I'll offer fifty million.

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:40.240
Eighty million.

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:43.480
One hundred million.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.639
Yes, that's right.

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:48.079
I'll offer 100 million.

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:49.519
Let's sign the contract right now.

00:05:49.519 --> 00:05:51.079
I'll transfer the money to you shortly.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.160
100 million.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.160
Yes.

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:55.439
I didn't mishear, did I, Mr. Zhou?

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:56.079
You heard right.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.519
Thank you so much, Mr. Zhou.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.560
Here, let's do this.

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.319
Let me toast to you.

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:02.879
Alright, alright.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.560
What are you standing there for? Hurry up and toast!

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:05.279
Okay.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.000
No, no, no.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.240
Let us toast to you.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.040
Yes, we should be the ones to toast.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.480
That's right, that's right.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.839
Mr. Zhou, looking forward to a great partnership.

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:10.399
Looking forward to working together.

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:11.560
Here, a toast to you all.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.439
Alright.

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:13.480
Looking forward to working together.

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:14.560
Looking forward to working together.

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:27.040
Qingyan

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.639
The 100 million yuan investment from Tiange Group

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:29.839
just arrived in full.

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:30.879
It's all here.

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:32.319
That's great!

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.879
This feels just like a dream.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.800
The 100 million yuan investment from Tiange Group—

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:37.120
you got it just by having a meal?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.040
How did you do it?

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.240
I don't know either.

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:43.360
I also feel like this is all a dream.

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.279
You don't know either?

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:47.360
Did this guy pretend to be Gao Feng again

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.480
and fool Mr. Zhou and the others?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.120
Hey.

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:51.160
This time, I really didn't say anything.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.639
You didn't say anything?

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.480
You nearly scared me to death.

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:56.639
Luckily, Mr. Zhou and the others are generous.

00:06:56.639 --> 00:06:57.399
They didn't hold it against you.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.879
But this still doesn't make sense.

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:02.240
After all, it's a huge investment of 100 million yuan.

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:03.759
How could it be so casual,

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:05.160
just giving it away like that?

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:08.759
It really doesn't make sense.

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:10.680
But

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.279
ever since I married this guy,

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.240
strange things have been happening more and more.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.000
Tell me,

00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:19.639
do you think all of this has anything to do with you?

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.240
He's just a food delivery guy.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.519
What could it possibly have to do with him?

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:26.600
I just thought of something.

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:27.560
What did you think of?

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:29.199
This time, the new skincare product our company is launching

00:07:29.199 --> 00:07:30.199
is

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:32.319
actually created by Master Chen Daoyuan.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:34.839
Master Chen is a famous reclusive expert from the southern province.

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:37.560
It's said that he went through countless ancient texts

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.279
and spent five years developing this formula.

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:40.920
The skincare and beauty effects are excellent.

00:07:41.079 --> 00:07:43.079
Once it's on the market, it's sure to be a big hit.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.079
Maybe Tiange Group

00:07:45.079 --> 00:07:46.759
got wind of this news in advance

00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:48.759
and thought our company would keep growing stronger,

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:51.079
so they decided to invest heavily.

00:07:51.079 --> 00:07:51.959
They're making early arrangements.

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:54.480
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.759
I think your explanation

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:56.879
is the most reasonable one.

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:00.040
Great analysis.

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:01.480
You're really a little detective genius.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:02.959
You don't have to tell me that.

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:03.879
Qingyan,

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:05.519
I'll go out and see if I can find out any more news.

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:07.680
Bye-bye.

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:17.079
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:18.360
Is there something on my face?

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.040
I'm just happy. Thank you.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.759
Why are you thanking me?

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:28.839
Didn't your little detective already help you figure it out?

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.000
I don't know why,

00:08:32.279 --> 00:08:33.720
but ever since I married you,

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:35.879
my luck has just kept getting better.

00:08:55.279 --> 00:08:56.120
What are you doing?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.600
So how do you plan to thank me?

00:08:59.879 --> 00:09:01.240
How do you want me to thank you?

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.440
How about this—

00:09:03.759 --> 00:09:06.080
You make up for the wedding night you owe me.

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.600
No way.

00:09:08.159 --> 00:09:09.679
We agreed on three rules.

00:09:09.759 --> 00:09:11.279
You're not allowed to have any improper thoughts about me.

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.399
Oh, right.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.399
Then how about you give me a kiss?

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:19.399
No taking advantage of me.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.960
So I can't do this or that—

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.000
Then what do you want?

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.279
How about you bow to me?

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.440
Stop talking nonsense.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.279
How about this—

00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:31.480
I'll buy you a drink.

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:39.399
I'm fine.

00:09:41.879 --> 00:09:42.679
Let me tell you—

00:09:42.879 --> 00:09:44.919
I can still keep drinking.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.240
With your tolerance?

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.080
Next time, don't invite people to drink.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.720
Okay?

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:51.679
Let me tell you—

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:54.240
I never used to drink before.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.679
But today I'm happy.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.799
Sixty million is finally all settled.

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:02.360
My family won't force me to marry Song Haoyang anymore.

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:06.039
Sit here quietly for a while.

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:08.320
I'll go make you some hangover soup.

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:10.440
Don't go.

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:11.559
Miss.

00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:13.720
Can you please sit quietly for a bit?

00:10:17.159 --> 00:10:17.960
Happy

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.759
Thank you

00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:23.759
Ever since my parents passed away

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.639
I've always felt so lonely

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:30.320
I worked hard and made money desperately

00:10:30.799 --> 00:10:32.679
All because I wanted to become

00:10:32.679 --> 00:10:34.840
someone as successful as Gao Feng

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.679
But who would have thought, in the end

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.279
I can't even decide my own marriage

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.279
But

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.159
until you appeared

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.440
you made the world feel bright again

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.960
I feel

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:54.120
the things that used to be so difficult

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.519
suddenly became easy to solve

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.080
I don't even know why

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.159
After meeting you

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:03.519
I suddenly became very lucky

00:11:04.279 --> 00:11:07.240
Even though you're just a delivery person

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.840
I know you can't really help me much

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.279
But

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.159
you're the one who reignited my confidence

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.480
and gave me a sense of security facing the unknown

00:11:21.759 --> 00:11:22.559
Happy

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:26.039
Really, thank you

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:31.399
No need to thank me.

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:34.039
You deserve all of this.

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:36.759
So young, yet already misbehaving.

00:11:36.759 --> 00:11:37.720
You stole something.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.360
Uncle Chen, why did you catch him?

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.639
This kid snuck into our house to steal.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.639
He's already going down the wrong path at such a young age.

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.399
I have to take him to the police station.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.320
He only stole food.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.159
He didn't take anything else.

00:11:49.159 --> 00:11:50.480
That means he's not a bad kid.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.039
He's just hungry.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.080
Uncle Chen, let him go.

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.039
Wait a moment.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.039
Hold on.

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:06.360
Is your family having some trouble?

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.960
My dad says we should help people in need.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.679
That way, when we face difficulties ourselves,

00:12:10.679 --> 00:12:12.120
others will help us too.
