WEBVTT

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.679
What?

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:13.519
Not drinking?

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.759
Then just wait to collect his body.

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:28.719
Honey, you don't need to drink this.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.359
Stop making a scene.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.320
Don't worry.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:33.840
Leave the rest to me.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.560
Leave it to you?

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.039
Who do you think you are?

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:39.439
Let me tell you,

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.240
If she doesn't make me happy today,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.679
none of you are leaving through this door.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.520
Drink up!

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.799
You like drinking, right?

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.920
You—

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.719
Let me pour you a drink.

00:01:06.519 --> 00:01:07.319
No—

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:10.359
Don't!

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.680
Are you crazy?

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:21.439
I'll kill you!

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:25.760
How dare you hit Liu Shao!

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.920
You're finished!

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.359
Didn't I tell you before,

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:36.239
the next time I see you,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.400
I'd beat you so badly your own mother wouldn't recognize you?

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.799
I always keep my word.

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:42.760
Wait a second, Gaoxing.

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:44.280
Liu Shao.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.439
I apologize to you on his behalf.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.519
Liu Shao, Liu Shao!

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:49.560
Don't listen to her.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.239
This person must be killed.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.000
Fine, fine, fine.

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:03.719
Since the day I was born,

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:06.519
I've never suffered such humiliation.

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:09.039
I've changed my mind now.

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.240
Every single one of you,

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.400
none of you are leaving.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.439
Someone, come!

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.400
Liu Xin

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.319
Do you think

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.960
you can do whatever you want in Yun City?

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:33.360
That's right.

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.280
If you mess with my Liu family,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.599
you won't be able to take a single step in Yun City.

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:40.439
Is that so?

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.400
So, no one can control you now?

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:44.759
I'd like to see

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.800
if your father, Liu Shanhe, were here in front of me,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.439
would you dare to say that?

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.240
Liu Shanhe of Yuncheng failed to raise his son properly.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.840
His son owes money and refuses to pay it back.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.800
Have him appear before me within ten minutes.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:01.879
Gao, are you still pretending?

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.680
You’re not seriously saying

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.479
that just now, with that phone call,

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.800
you could actually get Old Master Liu Shanhe to come here?

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:09.439
Do you know who he is?

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.960
Do you know his status?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.800
You think you could summon him?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.479
At a time like this, you’re still playing tricks?

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:17.960
Liu Shanhe isn’t a fool.

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.919
How could he fall for your kind of scam?

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.240
Gao Xing,

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.960
this time you’re really in big trouble.

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.960
Don’t worry.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.639
When Liu Shanhe arrives,

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.560
you’ll see who’s really in trouble.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.560
Young Master Liu, Young Master Liu,

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.199
this guy is crazy.

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.719
He’s lied so much he believes it himself.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.240
He even said ten minutes.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.439
I think he’s just stalling for time.

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:40.319
Don’t fall for his tricks.

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:42.000
It’s fine.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.759
If he wants to stall, I’ll let him.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:49.000
I love watching people struggle in vain.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:50.680
Ten minutes, right?

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:51.719
How about this:

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.520
If within ten minutes

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.759
my dad shows up,

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.240
I’ll kneel and apologize to you.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.919
But if my dad doesn’t come,

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:01.240
today,

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.960
don’t blame me for showing no mercy.

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.319
There are nine minutes left.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.160
Ah.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.920
Get the car ready, quickly!

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.519
Yes, sir!

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:28.879
You have three minutes left.

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.879
You have one minute left.

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:47.319
What should we do?

00:05:00.519 --> 00:05:01.319
Five.

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:04.519
Four.

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:07.120
Three.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.639
Two.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.360
One.

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:17.839
Time's up.

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.800
Where is Old Master Liu?

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.759
Keep bragging.

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:26.600
Arrest all of them.

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:28.759
Bastard! Stop!

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:32.480
Dad, why are you here?

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.480
Look at the mess you've made, you beast.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.000
You blind fool.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.519
Dad.

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:41.439
Why are you hitting me for no reason?

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:44.040
You caused such a huge disaster and still have the nerve to ask me?

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:45.000
Old Master Liu.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.759
Is there some kind of misunderstanding here?

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:48.639
Young Master Liu has been discussing business with me the whole time.

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:49.680
Get out.

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:51.639
This is none of your business.

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:54.879
Mr. Gao...

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.439
I am Liu Shanhe.

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:59.079
This fool has greatly offended you.

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:02.319
I apologize to you on his behalf.

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.319
Dad

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.480
He's the man Su Qingyan found.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.079
Why are you being so polite to him?

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.920
Shut up.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.759
Kneel down, now.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.560
Apologize to Mr. Gao.

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:18.040
I should apologize to him?

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.319
He's the one who doesn't know his place.

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:20.319
He dares to mess with me.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.639
Did you hear me?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.160
I told you to apologize.

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:24.240
Are you going to apologize or not?

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:26.240
Do you understand?

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.759
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:31.680
Mr. Gao

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.399
I'm sorry, I was wrong.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.639
What did you do wrong?

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.000
I...

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:40.759
Liu Xin

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.600
There’s always someone better out there.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:46.240
Those who bully others will be bullied in return.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.800
Don’t be too arrogant.

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:49.199
Yes.

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:50.279
Yes.

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:52.360
It's all my fault for not raising my son properly.

00:06:52.519 --> 00:06:55.439
Mr. Gao, please forgive us.

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:58.519
I’ll make sure to discipline him strictly when we get home.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.600
About what happened today,

00:07:00.959 --> 00:07:02.920
please don’t take it to heart.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.959
Sigh.

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.839
That’s not up to me.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.480
It depends on my wife.

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:09.720
Yes, yes, of course.

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:11.560
I didn’t think it through.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.319
Miss Su

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.639
Please be magnanimous.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:15.519
Please calm down.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.839
I heard my son owes your company fifteen million.

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:22.519
Here’s twenty million.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.319
Please accept it.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.920
Twenty million

00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:35.079
Honey

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.240
It's only right to pay interest on your debts.

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:38.079
Just take it.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.000
I'll let it go this time for my wife's sake.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.800
But I don't want there to be a next time.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:44.199
Do you understand?

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:45.480
Yes, yes, yes.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.639
Don't worry, Mr. Gao.

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.639
I promise there won't be a next time.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.959
Honey

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:53.079
Let's go.

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:02.279
Dad

00:08:02.519 --> 00:08:03.519
Dad

00:08:03.519 --> 00:08:05.040
Who exactly is that Mr. Gao?

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.680
Don't ask about things you shouldn't.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:07.720
Our Liu family also has quite a few

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.040
wealthy and powerful friends.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.319
Why are you so afraid of him?

00:08:10.319 --> 00:08:11.120
Shut up.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.839
Do you think having money and power means you can do whatever you want?

00:08:15.279 --> 00:08:16.439
Let me tell you,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:18.639
this man is very wealthy,

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.959
but people respect him not because of his money,

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:25.040
but because he has made great contributions

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.160
to many places and many people.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.360
Countless important people hold him in high regard.

00:08:32.039 --> 00:08:34.279
If you mess with him, you'll anger a lot of people.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.240
No one will be able to help you.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.399
Is he really that powerful?

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:39.120
Could he really be Gao Feng?

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.279
It's none of your business.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.039
Go home and stay grounded for a month.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.840
You're not allowed any contact with the outside world.

00:08:57.879 --> 00:08:58.799
Qingyan

00:08:58.960 --> 00:08:59.840
Pinch me, quick.

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.080
I'm not dreaming, am I?

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:04.679
We actually got the money owed by Jin Zun Group back just like that.

00:09:04.679 --> 00:09:05.799
It's not just the debt.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.320
There's even five million in interest.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.360
It's not just you,

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:10.159
even I feel like I'm dreaming.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:11.919
Oh my god.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:14.000
This is Jin Zun Group we're talking about.

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:15.799
The money owed by Liu Xin, the young master.

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:16.679
Who would dare to ask for it?

00:09:17.279 --> 00:09:20.080
Our Qingmu is the only one in Yuncheng who could do this.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.519
It's not just Liu Xin.

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:23.320
Did you see Old Master Liu?

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.720
Even he was nodding and bowing nervously to Gao Xing.

00:09:27.279 --> 00:09:28.919
It's simply unbelievable.

00:09:29.879 --> 00:09:31.000
The Sanhe incident,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.799
you could chalk it up to luck.

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:34.639
But even Liu Shanhe from Jin Zun Group

00:09:34.639 --> 00:09:35.960
has to show him respect.

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:39.240
There's just no way to explain this.

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:42.960
Who exactly is this Gao Xing?

00:09:44.039 --> 00:09:45.000
Qingyan

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.840
Didn't you say he was a food delivery guy?

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.720
He is a delivery guy.

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:49.960
The first time I met him,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.799
he was delivering food.

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:51.840
You saw it too.

00:09:51.879 --> 00:09:53.840
And Song Haoyang even looked into his background.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.600
He really is just a delivery guy.

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.240
If he really is just a delivery guy,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.879
how could he possibly keep Zhao Daqiang in check?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.320
And Liu Shanhe treats him with such respect.

00:10:02.519 --> 00:10:03.639
This Gao Xing

00:10:04.039 --> 00:10:06.159
must be hiding some huge secret.

00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:07.879
No way.

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:09.879
I have to investigate him thoroughly.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:18.919
Come here.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:21.919
Stand here.

00:10:27.039 --> 00:10:28.759
What's wrong, honey? Is something up?

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.159
At home, you can only call me President Su.

00:10:32.639 --> 00:10:34.399
Stand up straight, I have something to ask you.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:35.840
Yeah?

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.120
Even if you're the boss,

00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:39.120
I'm still your capable vice president, right?

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.480
I just recovered over twenty million for the company.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.879
Why are you interrogating me like a criminal?

00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:44.759
That's exactly what I want to ask about.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.159
Tell me the truth.

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:50.679
How exactly did you get those two payments back?

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:53.320
Didn't you see everything?

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:54.639
Those guys from Sanhe Company,

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:55.879
they may look like a bunch of thugs on the surface,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.720
but they're actually pretty decent people.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.639
I just reasoned with them using my fists,

00:11:00.919 --> 00:11:02.120
appealed to their emotions,

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:03.240
and persuaded them with logic.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.759
They were moved and convinced by me.

00:11:07.639 --> 00:11:09.559
Let's not talk about Sanhe Company for now.

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:11.279
What about JinZun Group?

00:11:11.759 --> 00:11:13.559
Liu Shanhe has connections on both sides of the law.

00:11:13.679 --> 00:11:14.840
His background is very deep.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.120
Even he treats you with fear and respect.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:18.960
What,

00:11:19.159 --> 00:11:20.320
was he also moved by you?

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:21.200
Of course.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:22.320
Think about it,

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.639
even a thug like Zhao Daqiang listens to reason.

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.919
Someone as important as Liu Shanhe

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.519
would definitely understand the bigger picture even more.

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:29.120
When he saw his own son doing bad things,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.519
he immediately put justice before family.

00:11:30.519 --> 00:11:31.320
How touching.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.080
Enough.

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:33.360
Happy now?

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.039
Do you think I would believe

00:11:35.039 --> 00:11:36.120
what you just said?

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.559
I'm going to ask you one last time.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.799
What really happened?

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.960
You really want to know?

00:11:46.759 --> 00:11:47.559
Of course.

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:50.480
Alright.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.200
Since you really want to know,

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:00.440
That's right.

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:02.879
I'm not just an ordinary delivery guy.

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:05.279
My true identity

00:12:05.679 --> 00:12:07.600
is actually Gao Feng, the president of Junsheng Group.
