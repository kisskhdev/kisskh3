00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
(This drama is based on a true story.)

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
(The plot was adjusted for entertainment purposes only.)

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000
(We have no intention to offend any careers, )

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
(encourage immoral sexual values, )

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:05.039
(or create a pessimistic disposition of a gender or a group of people.)

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.800
(We would like to apologize in advance for any misunderstandings.)

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.480
(Presents)

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.960
(Theory of Love)

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.360
What was that? I’m so confused.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.560
Don’t be confused.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.920
He's gay.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.880
Wow, I didn't know someone could be that evil.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.920
A guy like him needs to face a guy like me.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.320
I’m here today

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.080
because I want to ask for your help.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.360
How do you want me to help?

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.880
Hello, are you James?

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.320
Yes.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.640
Hello, Nhong.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Why did you come back?

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.200
I love you.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.160
I love you, James.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.920
Because of you, I was born.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.920
Because of you, I tasted the meaning of life.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.040
For you, I would die.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.240
And because of you, I am now lost.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.360
Uea, I want to return this book.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.880
When I look back,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.320
- it occurred to me - I told you, didn't I?

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.399
- that in the past, - You have to peel that off

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.000
- he was truly devoted to me. - before returning the book.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240
It's a waste of time.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.880
Come on, aren’t you even going to check what I bookmarked?

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.920
They’re excerpts I want you to read.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:51.920
Return it in the box next time.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.280
Not here.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.160
I finally understand why he was willing to do so much for me.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.440
I love you.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.280
I love you, James.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.360
- Nhong, where are my clothes? - Yes?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
You’re awake.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.040
I washed them for you.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.960
They’ll be dry soon.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.800
I won't let you be naked all day.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.760
Unless you want to be.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.640
I can be naked with you too.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.880
It's okay.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.360
Just kidding. Let’s eat.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.960
Sit down, James.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.480
Food’s best when it’s hot.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.000
This is yours.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.760
Wow.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.480
Why did you cook so much?

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.240
This is an American breakfast.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.960
If we move there, we’ll be eating this a lot.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.720
So get used to it.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.280
Come on, eat up.

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.480
So, you think you can eat this every day?

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.520
Of course.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.280
Really?

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.520
So, you’ve decided to move to the States with me, huh?

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.320
Well...

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.120
I’ve thought about it.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.840
It’d be better if I moved there with you.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.720
But...

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.720
I want to know your plan.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.840
If we move there, how are we going to live?

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.640
I don’t want to leech off you.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.160
Fine, if you’re uncomfortable,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.640
you can try for a scholarship.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.600
But don’t worry if you don’t get it.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.600
I’m not too serious about money.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.920
I can take care of you, alright?

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.800
Nhong.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.480
Since we’re a couple and starting a life together,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.920
do you mind if I ask

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.240
where you got all that money from?

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.720
Well...

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.600
James, I...

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.720
I was a scammer.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.520
But I’ve quit.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.320
I quit because I met you.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.040
Are you sure you’ve quit?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.400
You’re not lying to me, are you?

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.200
Finish your breakfast. I've got something to show you.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.040
Okay.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.320
Let's go.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.600
- Hello, Nhong. - Hello.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.280
You’re here again.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.120
I’ve been coming by a lot lately.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.760
I’m planning to move abroad.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.280
I’ll be moving my things out gradually.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:32.840
Please, go ahead.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Come on, James.

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.280
- Please close the door. - Okay.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.840
What’s all this?

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:32.800
Open it.

00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.800
How much is this worth?

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:07.360
Enough to buy a restaurant and pay for your master’s degree.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:10.600
Now do you believe me

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.080
that I’m not lying to you or trying to make you suffer abroad?

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.000
We’ll gradually sell the gold for cash,

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:21.720
so we have more spending money.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.160
You can help with the bookkeeping.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.760
Sure.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.879
- Are you heading out already? - Yes, I am.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.880
Goodbye.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.080
- Put them in the back seat. - Okay.

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.160
- Nhong. - Yes?

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.880
We’ve got so many snacks in the car.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.600
May I give one to the guard?

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.920
He looks tired.

00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:55.120
Of course. That's really generous.

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:00.680
Go ahead.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.240
Here. Some snacks for you.

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.760
Thank you.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.840
Next time, I’ll come pick things up for Nhong.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.640
Which days are you on duty?

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.080
I have morning shifts all week.

00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.080
Thank you.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.440
You're welcome.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.520
What were you guys talking about?

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.520
Nothing in particular.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.440
You're generous, James.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.640
(Uea, I know where the money is. See you at college tomorrow.)

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.600
Yes, James?

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.480
I just got here. I'm on my way.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:02.200
Okay, I just finished class. See you at the usual spot.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.680
Okay, sure.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.240
Nhong.

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.400
What? You look shocked.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.640
Why didn’t you tell me you were coming?

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.480
Why would I? It’s a surprise.

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:29.240
Do you want the flowers?

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:30.840
Yes, I do.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.160
Thank you so much.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.080
You should go. I have to get to class.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:41.760
Fine, I just wanted to see you.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:43.400
I missed you.

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:46.280
I have to go to the embassy later.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.120
Don’t forget to get your student verification certificate.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.760
It’s needed for the visa application.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.000
Okay, I’ll take care of it.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.440
Can I give you a kiss on the cheek here?

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.400
Nhong, no. There are too many people around.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.759
There’s no one here.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.640
Hurry up and go.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.080
Please.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.520
Alright, see you later.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.920
- Study hard, okay? - Okay.

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.880
- See you. - Okay.

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.280
Darn it.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.600
Uea.

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.440
Hello, where are you now?

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.520
Stop walking. Don’t come over yet.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.800
Why? What’s going on?

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:44.520
Nhong’s here to see me.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.080
What?

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.800
Where is he? What’s he doing here?

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.480
He’s heading toward the front of the building.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.760
Hello, Uea?

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.480
Uea.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.280
Tim.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.280
I...

00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:26.440
I’m not going to scold you,

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.720
but can we talk for a bit?

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.720
How have you been, Tim?

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.720
I moved back to Nakhon Sawan

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.400
to help my dad at his restaurant.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.120
What about you?

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:53.200
Are you still doing the same thing?

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:58.080
Uea, just say what you want to say.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.360
I want to say

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.160
that I’m no longer mad at you.

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.840
Tim.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000
When we were dating,

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.960
you were so good to me.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:29.960
When I was at my lowest,

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.640
you helped me through it.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.680
When I think about it,

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:39.800
the money I lost

00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.280
was the price for all the kindness you gave me.

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.040
So I don’t regret it at all.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.920
Is that all you have to say?

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.640
It’s a shame

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:00.000
our love wasn’t real.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.360
You might not understand me now.

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.720
But if you went through what I went through,

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.880
you’d understand.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.400
I have to go, Uea.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.560
I'm sorry.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:37.800
I’ve stopped doing that.

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.440
Now I’ve found the right person for me.

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.720
You’re sharp. You got him totally fooled.

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.000
If it were me, I would’ve attacked him.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:09.000
But I’m afraid he’ll find out.

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.280
Who would get scammed out of millions and just forgive?

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.400
If he finds out, the whole plan will be ruined.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:18.680
I don’t think so.

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:22.560
He just texted me asking me out to dinner.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.360
Here.

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:27.840
That means everything’s normal.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.880
Then we’re good.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:35.320
So, where did he hide the money?

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.880
Actually, it’s not money. It’s gold.

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.280
It’s in a big bag.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.280
So many bags, he has to rent a warehouse to store them.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.040
He showed it to me.

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.480
Really?

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:52.000
We were dating him for a while and didn’t know he had a warehouse.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.200
You’re right.

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:56.520
That means he really trusts you.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.680
What did you do to make him show you the warehouse?

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.240
You don’t need to know.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.360
I’ve got my ways.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.760
Just be ready.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.160
I’ll get the key, and we’ll go there tomorrow.

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.800
Be careful, James.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.320
Okay.

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.080
Hey, why are you spacing out?

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.280
I was just lost in thought.

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.120
I ran into someone yesterday.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.560
A person I scammed.

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.200
Really? What happened?

00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.320
I...

00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.320
I feel guilty.

00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:15.320
Why is that?

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.160
Because she forgave me so easily.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.920
The worse I was to her, the kinder she was to me,

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.520
which only made me feel even more guilty.

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.400
Then why don’t you pay her back?

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:38.720
So you won’t feel guilty anymore.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.960
What about our future, James?

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.560
We need cash to start fresh in the States.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.640
When we move there,

00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.160
no one knows what will happen.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:01.120
Having plenty of spare cash is best.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.760
I almost forgot.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.600
Don’t forget to write the introduction letter.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.760
Today’s the last day to apply for the scholarship.

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.240
Lucky I caught it just in time.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.080
That was a close call.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.320
Finish it and let me review it.

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.480
Okay.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.720
I’ll send you the email.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.080
Go to class, or you’ll be late.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.760
- Okay. - Good.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.480
- I'll get going. - Sure.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.960
Are you sure you don’t want us to go with you?

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:10.360
The more people go, the more suspicious it looks.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:13.680
Just wait in the car. It'll be faster if I go alone.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.560
Alright.

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:20.360
How many bags do you want me to bring out?

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.080
Just enough? Or are you looking to make a profit too?

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.680
If one box has ten 5-baht gold bars,

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.400
that’s about 2.5 million.

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.000
Four or five boxes per bag should be enough to cover our loss.

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.360
Just one bag, so it's easier for you.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.800
Most importantly, make sure it’s not chocolate.

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.400
- Yes. - Okay.

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.600
- Hello. - Hello.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.840
Do you remember me? I came here with Nhong.

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.760
Brought you some snacks and drinks.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.080
Thank you.

00:19:59.081 --> 00:20:01.360
Of course I remember you. You were just here.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.640
Nhong asked me to grab something. It won’t take long.

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:06.240
A lot of stuff? I can help.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.080
No, just one bag.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:09.520
Please, go ahead.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.520
I already bought the plane ticket.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.400
Yes, the security guard at the warehouse.

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:06.680
Hello, this is Nhong.

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.560
I’m the owner of unit 5B02.

00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:11.120
Did anyone access my warehouse today?

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.000
Yes, the young man who was with you the other day.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.440
He's grabbing something.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.880
He should be out soon.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.400
He’s just leaving.

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.360
Don’t let him leave. Stop him.

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:25.720
What? Can you say that again?

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:28.040
I didn’t give anyone permission to access my warehouse.

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:29.920
He stole my key.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.800
Stop him, he’s a thief.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.840
What? A thief?

00:22:34.240 --> 00:22:36.560
Catch him, hurry up!

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.920
Uea, we’re in trouble.

00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.840
We need to go now.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:42.680
Hey, stop.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.360
Stop right there.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.319
James, get in the car.

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.480
Take the bag.

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.959
- James, get in! - Don’t wait for me.

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:52.640
Just go!

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.640
Let go.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.559
What? You're just going to leave him?

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:57.760
We’ll come back for him later.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.040
Let go!

00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:03.560
You thief.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:06.480
You're done for, better get ready for prison.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.280
Phare.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.400
If we sell all this gold,

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.120
won’t the shop get suspicious?

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.320
Uea, are you seriously still thinking about that?

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.720
I thought you were worried about James.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.840
I am worried,

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.120
but he’s not replying to any of my messages.

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.760
Was his phone taken at the police station?

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.040
We have to help him.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:56.040
If we do,

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.400
we could get arrested as accomplices.

00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.240
Let’s lay low for now

00:24:04.600 --> 00:24:06.080
and wait for him to contact us.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.880
In the end,

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:34.000
you’re just like all the others.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Why, James?

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.160
I’m worth nothing to you, right?

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.080
Except for my money.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:47.960
You scammed so many people.

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:50.080
What gives you the right to criticize me?

00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.640
Do you know what hurts me the most?

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.400
With others, I was always prepared for the worst.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.040
I knew that once they got what they wanted, they’d leave.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.480
But you made me believe with all my heart.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.560
I believed you wanted nothing from me

00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.440
and that you really loved me.

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.720
If you had told me where the money was,

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:36.840
I wouldn’t have had to do this.

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.280
You did everything

00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.480
to win over Uea, didn't you?

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.200
James.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.680
Be honest with me.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.640
Did you ever think about loving me?

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.400
No.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.640
Not at all.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.200
Nhong, the police are here.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.920
Please go ahead and file your report.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.120
There’s nothing to report.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.280
You can tell them to leave.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:51.360
What?

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.040
This is all just a misunderstanding.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.960
Please take off his handcuffs.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.040
- But... - As for all the damage caused,

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.040
tell the owner to send me the bill.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:07.760
I'll pay for it.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.120
Okay, I'll take care of it.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:35.920
Nhong.

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:38.960
Why did you do that?

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:45.160
For the same reason you did it for Uea.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.720
I still hope

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.680
that you might still have feelings or feel good about me.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.720
Even though I know it’s almost impossible.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:18.480
It's him.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.640
Put him on speaker.

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.560
Hello, James. Where are you? How are you?

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.800
I’m safe.

00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.560
What do you mean?

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.280
Did he have you arrested?

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:33.840
No, he didn’t file a report.

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.000
As for the stolen stuff, he gave it up.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.480
What?

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.760
Why is he being so generous?

00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.160
Honestly, we didn’t steal anything.

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.880
We just got our stuff back.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:51.960
That's right.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:55.760
Phare, we got our money back.

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.400
Should we hire a lawyer and sue him?

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:03.320
Uea, that's enough.

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:05.840
Let it end here.

00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.960
He told me he would stop scamming

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.800
and turn his life around by opening a restaurant in the States.

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.720
Please, just let him go.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.640
Honestly,

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.760
I don’t want to go to court either.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.720
We got our money back, so let’s just forget it.

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.080
Alright?

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:32.720
James, where are you? Want us to pick you up?

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.840
It’s okay. It’s been a long day for you.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.520
Besides, I’m almost home.

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.040
Get home safe.

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.640
We won’t bother you anymore.

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.280
Thank you so much, James.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:50.720
Wait.

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.120
Next week is Preem’s birthday. Come to the party.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.400
Consider it a thank-you and a celebration of our success.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.960
Sure, see you then.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:20.160
Happy birthday to you

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.520
Happy birthday to you

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:30.440
Happy birthday, happy birthday

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:37.640
Happy birthday to Preem

00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:49.320
Blow out the candles.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.000
One more time.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:54.640
That's enough.

00:30:54.641 --> 00:30:55.720
You're almost there.

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.400
- One more. - I'm out of breath.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:22.120
You’re the reason I can enjoy cake again.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.360
When I was going through it,

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:26.720
I couldn’t sleep or eat.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.120
I’m glad to hear that.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.760
If it makes you happy,

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.280
I’m happy to do it.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.400
You’re the man.

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:38.200
Hey.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.520
Open your banking app.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.160
What are you doing?

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.880
Gold prices are rising,

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.800
so Phare and I thought

00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.040
we should repay you somehow.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.840
You don’t have to.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.360
I didn’t help you because I wanted your money.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:01.320
Are you rich or what? You're refusing to take cash.

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.559
- Come on, give me your QR code. - No.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.480
- Before I change my mind. - No.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.240
Your call.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.840
Uea.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.840
May I say something?

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:23.520
You can say whatever you want.

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:28.960
When I was with Nhong,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.120
I pictured your face instead of his.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.920
I wanted him to be you.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:41.920
I want to be with you.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.560
You probably know how I feel about you.

00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.240
I’ve had a crush on you since freshman year.

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.880
And I still do.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.560
I know.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.320
I think you already know

00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:11.760
I don’t have feelings for you.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.280
And honestly,

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.560
I don’t think I’m ready to fall in love with anyone.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:23.720
If you’d been through what I have,

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:25.840
you’d understand.

00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:27.440
But...

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.800
Aren’t you going to open your heart or give me a chance at all?

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.640
You can be sure I’d never hurt you.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.400
Thank you, James.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.520
But...

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.000
I really can’t accept your love.

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.920
When will you be able to?

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:00.120
I can wait.

00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:03.840
I can wait for you, Uea.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.120
Uea.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.680
Did you take a picture of me?

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.480
Let me see, do I look good?

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.720
Yes.

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.120
Mom got me a camera for my birthday.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.920
Look, I can pick which photo I want to print.

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.360
Please wait.

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.440
Preem.

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.160
I told you not to bother them. They’re talking.

00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.840
Let's take photos inside.

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:37.880
Phare. Uea.

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.000
I'll get going then.

00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.560
Goodbye.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.440
Bye, Preem.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:46.680
Goodbye.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.600
Bye.

00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.560
James.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:27.160
Please hug me.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.600
Please, James. Just one last time.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.800
Pretend you love me for one more minute.

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:37.480
Do it for me.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.840
Let’s not.

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.120
I don’t want to lie to you any longer.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.200
But I’m okay with being lied to.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.320
Please, just do it for me.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:35:59.920
Please.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.880
James.

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.120
Thank you for coming into my life.

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.040
I bought you a plane ticket to the States.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.160
If you change your mind and want to go,

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.400
just let me know.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:23.720
Alright?

00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:35.840
I love you.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:13.960
Hello?

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:17.600
Uea, it's me.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.440
Tim.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.400
Yes, it's me.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.760
Why are you calling me?

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.040
I’m calling to ask you

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.920
to take care of James.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.440
I know how much he loves you.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.480
What are you talking about?

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.800
Do you even know

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.080
how far James went to help you?

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.480
He sacrificed everything.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.480
He even had an intimate relationship with me

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.360
just to gain my trust.

00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:11.960
How many straight men

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.840
would go that far for someone they love?

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.400
Now that you know,

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:24.840
please take good care of him.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.600
You have something valuable that I could never have.

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.400
I’m jealous of you, Uea.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.120
Please take care of him.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.520
Uea.

00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:32.080
Why are you crying?

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.600
I...

00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.600
I can’t love him.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.080
I really can’t love him.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:51.800
It’s okay.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.080
It’s fine.

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:18.360
I’ve been thinking over everything, going back and forth.

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.320
The truth is,

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.400
I’m a fool,

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.240
a fool who was lied to.

00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:30.800
And a fool

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.480
for lying to someone without knowing.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:39.560
Honestly, it’s all over now.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.800
I’ve parted ways with both men.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.160
I just want to share my experience,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
in case it can help someone.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:57.040
Thank you for sharing your mistakes to help others.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:01.640
The first point is that whenever we have something on our minds,

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:03.720
we always post it on social media.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:08.960
That becomes a vulnerability for scammers to exploit us.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.880
So be careful what you post.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:16.960
I don’t think people who are lied to are fools.

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:23.200
We never expect there to be bad people who would take advantage.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:27.160
When you lied to him, it wasn’t intentional.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.680
You were so focused on yourself

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.520
that you weren't thinking about him.

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.160
But it’s good that you were honest with him

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.440
and didn’t keep lying.

00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.720
Thank you for listening to me, Aoy and Chod.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.840
I’ll remember this as a lesson.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:01.040
When I got the money back, it felt like a happy ending.

00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.840
But I still worry about

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.160
our future as a mother and child

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.200
without a husband.

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.040
or father.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:17.040
Based on what you told us, you’re talented.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:21.400
You should try applying for jobs or start a business.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.360
I’m sure you can do it.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:26.320
There are many single moms who succeed.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:30.560
Being independent and financially stable

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.480
is very important

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:35.360
whether we have a husband or not.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.400
As for a partner,

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.560
it might not be a husband or a life partner,

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.640
but it could be a good friend.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.040
What do you want to eat for dinner?

00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.400
What about that place? It's popular.

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:14.640
Sure, hold on.

00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:19.520
Who’s calling me? A strange number.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:21.560
A scammer?

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.800
Take the call and mess with him.

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.200
Okay.

00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.640
Hello?

00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.080
Are you Mr. Jirawat Keaw-wiset?

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.720
Yes, that's me.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:38.800
Someone took out an insurance policy and named you as the beneficiary.

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:43.040
I want you to sign some documents. May I ask where you are?

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:46.000
What? I’m the beneficiary?

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.880
You must be a scammer. I haven’t heard that trick before.

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:51.599
I'm not a scammer.

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.360
I’m a life insurance agent.

00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:56.520
This policy was made by Mr. Nhong Naruebodin.

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.560
(Life Insurance Policy)

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.440
Who’s paying for the insurance?

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:09.920
You don’t have to pay anything.

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.400
Nhong is the one paying,

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.520
and he’s been paying premiums for several years.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.120
So if something happens to him,

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.720
you will receive the benefits he arranged.

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.120
You’re saying if he dies, I’ll get the insurance payout?

00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:32.240
That's right.

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.680
Why would he do that?

00:44:39.080 --> 00:44:41.360
I don’t know either.

00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:44.240
But people who take out a life insurance policy

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.680
typically name someone who they love and care about

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.680
as the beneficiary.

00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:13.040
Excuse me.

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:18.120
Excuse me!

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:20.080
Hello.

00:45:20.081 --> 00:45:22.280
It's you.

00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.480
Long time no see. Why are you here?

00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.000
The faculty invited me to speak.

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:29.920
My book is a bestseller.

00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:31.920
I’m donating copies to the library.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:36.400
Wow, you went from a librarian to a celebrity!

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.080
Have you transferred money abroad before?

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:43.120
Why? Are you buying new books?

00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:44.800
No.

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.040
I’m transferring money to my boyfriend.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:49.920
He lives in the States.

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.280
Your boyfriend is in the States?

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:56.200
Yes, he’s an American soldier.

00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.680
His dad was a soldier too.

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.640
He used to be stationed in Takhli.

00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.400
So he’s very connected to Thailand.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.800
He likes traveling here and loves Thai food.

00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:09.280
He likes Thai women.

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.720
How did you meet him?

00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:15.080
He sent me a Facebook message.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:19.960
He said he was just randomly clicking around and found me.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.680
Cutie Thim.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:28.400
He also said I’m exactly his type.

00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:34.960
Don’t you think that’s a bit too much of a coincidence?

00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:36.440
What coincidence?

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:38.920
It's called destiny.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:41.520
Oh dear.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:46.320
I think he's definitely a scammer.

00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:52.080
Delete all your information. Stop talking to him

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.440
before you lose more money.

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.600
He’s not a scammer.

00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.400
I’ve checked.

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.560
We’ve been talking for months.

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.400
He said he’s sending me a present.

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:07.560
A very valuable present that’s stuck at immigration.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.600
I must transfer money for insurance before I can get the stuff out.

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.200
Help me transfer the money.

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.080
Stop. Stop right there.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.680
Here.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.520
Finish reading my book.

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:26.960
Do you understand?

00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:30.640
"Coincidental Love..."

00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:32.800
"Doesn't Exist."

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:35.880
That's not true.

00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:59.880
A coincidence is often deliberately created

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.480
by someone with bad intentions.

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:07.240
I’ve told you that all men are terrible.

00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.600
Not all men are like that.

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.560
Kla is a good guy.

00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.400
I started dating a girl.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.120
We have to keep it a secret.

00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.520
- Is Jelly your daughter, Dao? - See that!

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:21.920
She is here.

00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.320
Where are you?

00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:25.680
What did you do to my kid?

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.680
Jelly!

00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.600
Alright.

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:36.600
Go ahead.

00:48:36.601 --> 00:48:37.680
The bacon's good.

00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.240
I'll eat first.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.559
He bought it.

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.720
Yes.

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:49.160
Flying is really fun.

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.360
I thought it would be scarier.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:52.719
The wind was so strong.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:54.079
Can we go straight?

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.280
The birds were flying with us.

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.639
Yes.

00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:59.319
They were right next to us. So amazing.

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:02.080
They walked... I mean, they flew.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.280
That's right.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.280
That was good.
