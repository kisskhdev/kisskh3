The One Who Truly Understands Me

00:01:36.763 --> 00:01:37.806
{\an8}NAM TAEWOO

00:01:44.271 --> 00:01:45.272
Hello?

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:46.606
Hey…

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.358
Is this Juhyeong?

00:01:48.442 --> 00:01:49.568
Hey, it's been a while.

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:51.903
Hey, how are you doing?

00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.489
Yeah, I'm good.

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:57.367
What's up?

00:01:57.451 --> 00:02:00.829
Geez, this is kind of awkward
to talk about.

00:02:01.663 --> 00:02:04.624
I briefly went out
with this client of mine,

00:02:04.708 --> 00:02:07.502
but it turns out she's a married woman.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:10.547
Okay. So?

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.341
Well, anyway,

00:02:12.424 --> 00:02:16.553
her husband told everyone at work
I'm the guy she cheated with.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:20.849
Is there any way
to stop this rumor from spreading?

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:22.768
Well, you can't physically stop him.

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:25.103
You can't chase him around
and keep him quiet.

00:02:25.187 --> 00:02:27.648
Isn't there anything I can do legally?

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:29.941
You won't be able to stop him directly.

00:02:30.025 --> 00:02:32.527
- What about an affair lawsuit?
- It hasn't come up.

00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:34.446
If I didn't know she was married,

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.365
I don't need to worry, right?

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:38.950
You didn't know?

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:42.037
I honestly didn't know.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.041
I have all the texts
that show she lied about being single.

00:02:46.124 --> 00:02:47.959
I see. That won't be a problem then.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.463
Are you suing for defamation?
I'll refer you to another lawyer.

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.799
That depends
on where the water is leaking from.

00:02:53.882 --> 00:02:57.386
Depending on whether it's leaking
from upstairs or a shared pipe,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.013
it changes who's responsible.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.726
Right, you won't know
until you open it up.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.857
I don't know.

00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:13.610
I'm a lawyer, not a plumber.

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.613
Okay, bye.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:23.662
Seriously…

00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:27.249
Hi.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.462
Is there any reason
to sue the security guard?

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:41.430
So everyone is okay
with that law student intern program

00:03:41.513 --> 00:03:43.473
I mentioned last time, right?

00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:45.142
I can't afford to do that.

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.185
A lot of small costs
add up here and there.

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.729
- How will you handle that?
- You won't have to worry.

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:52.858
It won't be any trouble to you.
I'll take care of it.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.317
Okay, then. If you say so.

00:03:54.401 --> 00:03:56.862
I don't have much of a reason to say no.

00:03:57.696 --> 00:04:00.240
But honestly, I'm not sure
if it's necessary.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:01.992
Well, I've never done it before.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.619
I'm not sure how it works,
so I wasn't that interested.

00:04:06.913 --> 00:04:11.209
Promoting the firm
to clients is important,

00:04:11.293 --> 00:04:15.797
but you also have to create connections
with potential lawyers,

00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:19.301
so great attorneys
will join down the line.

00:04:22.137 --> 00:04:24.473
You really sound
like you're part of our firm.

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.518
I am grateful
the company has grown thanks to you.

00:04:28.602 --> 00:04:32.189
But still,
you're not actually one of us, right?

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:36.443
That last comment
kind of crossed the line a bit.

00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:40.197
There's been no word
of giving us a case either.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:47.370
I do think it'd be good
if law students got to know our firm.

00:04:48.413 --> 00:04:49.539
Don't you all agree?

00:04:49.623 --> 00:04:51.541
- I wouldn't say no to it.
- Me neither.

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:52.959
Of course, it's good.

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.086
Who doesn't know that?

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.130
I'm not opposed to it either

00:04:57.672 --> 00:04:59.174
as long as you handle everything.

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.053
Thank you so much.

00:05:03.637 --> 00:05:06.515
I'll do my best to make it work.

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:07.682
Can I order a dessert?

00:05:09.893 --> 00:05:10.936
Of course.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.771
Do you like meringues?

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.147
- Seriously…
- What?

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.151
Yes, thank you.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.489
Here, it's the grand opening.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:23.990
Here.

00:05:24.074 --> 00:05:25.325
All right.

00:05:27.494 --> 00:05:29.412
Thank you…

00:05:30.831 --> 00:05:33.166
Hello. It's for the grand opening.

00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:36.503
Here…

Welcome to Law Group Hyungmin.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.012
Thank you, Attorney Kim.

00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:29.890
I'm not a lawyer.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:31.474
I'm an advisor.

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:34.561
You're not a lawyer?

00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:38.523
Then, when are the other lawyers coming?

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:42.903
Let's go. I'll introduce you to them.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:44.279
- Okay!
- Sounds good!

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.365
Are you busy, Attorney Kang?

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:48.909
Hello, Ms. Kim.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.620
The internship starts today.

00:06:51.703 --> 00:06:53.955
If it's okay,
I'd like to introduce them to you.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:55.040
Of course.

00:06:55.123 --> 00:06:56.333
Hello.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.667
- Hello!
- Hello!

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.753
This is Attorney Kang Huiji.

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:01.212
It's our pleasure to meet you.

00:07:01.296 --> 00:07:02.380
It's our pleasure!

00:07:02.464 --> 00:07:04.674
It's a pleasure to meet you as well.

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:06.134
- All right.
- Have a good day.

00:07:06.217 --> 00:07:07.260
Take care.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:13.391
Also, if you have any closed case files,
mind if I take a few?

00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.268
I'd like the students to take a look.

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:18.647
Thank you, Attorney Ha.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.358
When you have time,
could you help them now and then?

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.401
Feel free to give them assignments too.

00:07:23.485 --> 00:07:24.819
Yes, of course.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.493
Come in.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:35.205
Sir, the defendant
for the court-appointed case is here.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.165
Okay. Is she in the conference room?

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:42.921
INDICTMENT
DEFENDANT DO MIKYUNG

00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:51.221
NEW LOAN OFFER
EMERGENCY LOANS FOR LOW CREDIT SCORES

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:53.515
I'm sorry. Things are tough right now,

00:07:53.598 --> 00:07:55.642
so I could only use
a court-appointed lawyer.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:58.561
Not at all. Don't worry about that.

00:07:59.396 --> 00:08:02.357
You've been charged
with aiding and abetting fraud.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.526
You know why you've been charged, right?

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.737
Charged? What does that exactly mean?

00:08:07.821 --> 00:08:10.990
Even if I read it,
I honestly have no idea what it means.

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:14.828
So the prosecution believes
you committed a crime,

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:16.538
so they've sent this case to trial.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.415
That's what we call being "charged."

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.542
They're charges
of aiding and abetting fraud.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.711
I get the fraud part,

00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:24.713
but what does "aiding and abetting" mean?

00:08:24.796 --> 00:08:27.173
Does it mean
I just stood by while it happened?

00:08:27.257 --> 00:08:29.300
That's a common misunderstanding.

00:08:29.384 --> 00:08:32.178
It means you helped, not just stood by.

00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:34.139
It's a type of accomplice.

00:08:34.222 --> 00:08:36.224
You're saying I helped commit fraud?

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.229
Yes, it says you were involved
in a voice phishing scheme.

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.398
You acted as a money mule.

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:49.821
They're saying you withdrew the money
from the scam and handed it off.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:53.366
That's not true.
All I did was just try to get a loan.

00:08:56.494 --> 00:08:58.204
According to the indictment,

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:02.083
after getting a text from someone
calling himself Baek from BX Bank,

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:03.793
you spoke with him on the phone.

00:09:03.877 --> 00:09:05.545
Do you remember what was said?

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:08.882
Yes. At first, he said
I wouldn't qualify for a loan.

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:10.759
But then, he said he'd make sure

00:09:10.842 --> 00:09:12.260
to help me out to get a loan.

00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:15.930
Your account hasn't had much activity,
so your credit rating is low.

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:18.183
We'll help you create
some transactions first.

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.393
In my bank account?

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.981
I'm only suggesting this
since I trust you, Ms. Do.

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:26.107
Here you go.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:32.572
{\an8}First, I'll deposit some money
into your account

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:34.115
to create some transactions.

00:09:34.199 --> 00:09:35.992
Thank you.

00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:39.954
But you can't keep that money.
You have to return it to us.

00:09:43.124 --> 00:09:45.794
- Great job, ma'am.
- Thank you.

00:09:46.878 --> 00:09:48.379
Thank you.

00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:54.928
But in the end,
he never gave me the loan.

00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:00.600
Do you happen
to have a recording of that phone call?

00:10:01.184 --> 00:10:02.560
I'm not sure.

00:10:02.644 --> 00:10:05.355
- Could I see your phone again?
- Of course.

00:10:08.608 --> 00:10:11.027
This happened last November, so…

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.864
Here it is.

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:16.825
Here.

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.284
BX BANK
BAEK JEONGHYEON

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:22.539
Hello, this is Baek Jeonghyeon
with BX Bank. How may I help you?

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:26.209
I'm calling about the text I got.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:27.961
The call was recorded.

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:30.380
- Were you questioned by the police alone?
- Yes.

00:10:30.964 --> 00:10:34.509
It seems what you just said
wasn't conveyed, so they charged you.

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.095
If this recording had been submitted,

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:40.682
it would've been clear
that you were tricked and not involved.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.393
Am I okay then?

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:45.478
It wasn't voice phishing, right?

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:47.230
Well…

00:10:47.981 --> 00:10:52.235
The voice phishing victims did transfer
money into your account though.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:56.990
And you did withdraw that money
and handed it over to the scammers.

00:10:58.116 --> 00:10:59.868
But you didn't know it was a scam.

00:10:59.951 --> 00:11:01.369
I had no idea.

00:11:01.953 --> 00:11:05.415
I also wondered if this was
some kind of voice phishing

00:11:05.498 --> 00:11:06.749
and asked him about it.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:08.501
But he told me it wasn't that.

00:11:09.043 --> 00:11:11.754
He didn't ask me for money or anything.

00:11:11.838 --> 00:11:15.341
He just said he'd give me a loan,
so I believed him.

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.635
Don't worry too much about it.

00:11:17.719 --> 00:11:20.305
If you submit
a transcript of this recording,

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:22.140
it'll prove your innocence.

00:11:22.724 --> 00:11:26.227
Goodness. Thank you, Attorney Cho!

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.355
INDICTMENT
DEFENDANT DO MIKYUNG

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:33.735
The main voice phishing scammers
are usually overseas,

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:37.113
so I heard they track down
all the money mules here

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:38.698
and push for heavy sentences.

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:40.825
I heard some get a few years in prison.

00:11:40.909 --> 00:11:44.621
Still, she didn't even know
she was used as a money mule.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:47.373
How can they charge her
after such a sloppy investigation?

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:53.338
Still can't get a hold of him?

00:11:53.421 --> 00:11:55.298
No. It's so annoying.

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:58.301
If I ever get my hands on this bastard…

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:00.220
That unpaid construction cost son of a…

00:12:00.303 --> 00:12:01.888
- That person?
- Yeah.

00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:05.642
{\an8}We have a site inspection tomorrow.
What is he doing?

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:07.769
{\an8}I asked for documents,
but I can't reach him.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:09.229
{\an8}Filing isn't the end, okay?

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:10.563
Calm down.

00:12:10.647 --> 00:12:12.357
The building's not even finished.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.276
They stopped over a payment issue,

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.404
so someone who knows the details
needs to be there.

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:21.282
The client's all carefree,
and I'm the one who's stressed.

00:12:22.075 --> 00:12:24.327
You'd think I was the one being stiffed.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:25.954
I did think that.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:31.292
Hey, it's nice being at a cafe though.

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:33.586
We've always been stuck
in the break room lately.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.798
Are those interns set up
in the break room?

00:12:36.881 --> 00:12:38.758
Yeah, did they stop by and say hi?

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:40.760
They asked us to drop by now and then.

00:12:40.843 --> 00:12:43.137
- Yeah, they did.
- Was I that baby-faced back then?

00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:44.722
They were cute.

00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:47.517
They didn't come say hi to me.

00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.102
Hey.

00:12:50.144 --> 00:12:52.689
I guess Ms. Kim also knows now
that you're a jerk.

00:12:53.356 --> 00:12:54.732
What are you going to do now?

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:57.402
I was out this morning.
They must've come by then.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:13:00.863
Shouldn't we at least do a welcome dinner
or something for them tonight?

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:01.948
I can't tonight.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:05.410
The contractor probably
won't even show tomorrow,

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:08.621
so I'll have to comb through
whatever documents I have.

00:13:08.705 --> 00:13:09.706
How about tomorrow?

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.332
I have plans.

00:13:11.874 --> 00:13:14.210
- With who?
- He's meeting his high school friends.

00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:18.881
Even though I'm in early pregnancy,
my husband insisted on going too.

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:23.636
He said you hadn't come in a while
and used you as his excuse.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.139
He said I needed to be there
as his excuse.

00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:27.724
He's buying
to celebrate the baby.

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.601
Ridiculous.
Does he think he's the pregnant one?

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:33.855
I can just make plans for tomorrow too.
Let's have the dinner then.

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:35.231
- Sure.
- Yeah, do it tomorrow.

00:13:35.315 --> 00:13:37.108
Ms. Kim didn't ask Juhyeong,

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:38.735
- so he won't have to come.
- Right?

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:40.653
I told you I was out then.

00:13:55.334 --> 00:13:56.377
Yes.

00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:07.847
- Hello!
- Hello!

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:10.391
There's no need to be so formal with us.

00:14:10.475 --> 00:14:12.727
Have a seat.
I'm not a professor or your boss.

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.187
- Please sit.
- Okay.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.605
- Thank you.
- You're sitting?

00:14:17.106 --> 00:14:19.275
I'm just kidding! Sit down.

00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:20.359
Okay.

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:25.364
UNJUST ENRICHMENT

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:27.658
- Have you read this too?
- No, not yet.

00:14:27.742 --> 00:14:29.118
This was my case.

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.745
- Goodness.
- Incredible.

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:33.539
If it's okay, would you like to try
writing a report?

00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:34.624
- Sure.
- I'll write one.

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:35.875
- Me too!
- Okay, then.

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.127
If anything's unclear,
I can help for a moment.

00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:55.520
This looks too complex, like wordplay.
It's hard to follow the word order.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.190
- Ms. Kim?
- Yes?

00:14:59.273 --> 00:15:02.902
Could you copy the evidence record
for today's court-appointed case?

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:05.488
- Yes, of course.
- Ms. Kim, hold on.

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.490
- It's a court-appointed case, right?
- Yes.

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:08.616
I see.

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:11.828
Copy court-appointed files yourself now.
Don't go through the staff.

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:16.749
This is how we've always done it,
and you approved it too.

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:18.251
Well, not anymore.

00:15:19.544 --> 00:15:23.548
Technically, court-appointed cases
aren't firm cases. They're personal ones.

00:15:24.841 --> 00:15:27.760
Yes, but the firm needs to meet
our pro bono hours.

00:15:27.844 --> 00:15:29.637
My court-appointed cases fulfill that.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.390
Does the firm get paid for those?
No, they pay to you.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:35.685
Ms. Kim, don't worry
about court-appointed cases.

00:15:36.477 --> 00:15:37.603
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:38.938
Water those plants instead.

00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:41.858
Yes, sir.

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:46.028
I'll take care of it.

00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:56.914
Thank you.

THE STORY OF NARM
SEASON FOUR

00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:45.773
Damn it.

00:17:45.856 --> 00:17:48.568
You guys always show up
right when I take a quick break

00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:49.652
and frighten me.

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:50.861
Why are you so startled?

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:53.948
- Were you looking at something weird?
- No.

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:55.658
What are you doing here?

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:57.159
No reason.

00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:58.578
Are you busy?

00:17:58.661 --> 00:18:01.497
Yeah, because of tomorrow's inspection.

00:18:01.998 --> 00:18:05.293
The construction plans changed a lot,
so I need to know them well.

00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:09.255
But with no help from the client,
this is all I can do.

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:10.339
By the way,

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:12.300
is it okay to work this late?

00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:14.719
Why not? I've always been a night owl.

00:18:14.802 --> 00:18:17.138
Shouldn't you stop now?
Because of the baby?

00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:20.891
You think so?

00:18:22.518 --> 00:18:24.020
Your stomach's gotten bigger too.

00:18:24.854 --> 00:18:25.855
No, it hasn't.

00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.357
It hasn't even been that many weeks.

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:29.984
- Really?
- It hasn't.

00:18:34.614 --> 00:18:36.198
What are you doing here this late?

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.576
That voice phishing case
I mentioned earlier.

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:40.661
It seemed like a simple matter.

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:42.204
Why are you still working on it?

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.499
It's not that simple anymore.

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:48.294
Normal cases should be easy to represent.

00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:52.632
Even with all that clear evidence
that shows she's innocent,

00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:54.425
they still charged her.

00:18:56.677 --> 00:18:57.845
Well, yeah.

00:18:57.928 --> 00:19:02.516
Voice phishing is still prevalent,
so they're cracking down hard.

00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:05.436
Exactly. That is what's making me nervous.

00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:11.400
This seems like an excessive charge,
but I'm worried they'll still convict her.

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:14.111
Geez.

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:17.531
And they can't catch real scumbags
like Jang Sugil.

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:22.453
That prison visit thing
is over now, right?

00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:26.582
Yeah. It's the first time I've ever wanted
the prosecution to arrest my client.

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:29.418
Wait. I wasn't his attorney.

00:19:29.502 --> 00:19:31.045
So he's not even my client.

00:19:31.837 --> 00:19:34.548
Don't overthink it. Just let it go.

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:37.593
Instead of catching guys like him,
they're after the wrong people.

00:19:38.386 --> 00:19:39.637
So, it keeps bugging me.

You're still not picking up?

00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:14.171
- You're the defendant and building owner?
- Yes.

00:20:15.131 --> 00:20:17.717
- It's only you for the plaintiff side?
- Yes.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.801
Is that so?

00:20:20.136 --> 00:20:21.262
Then, let's get started.

00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:22.722
Please put these on, everyone.

00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:24.223
Okay.

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:29.979
What was the plan for the floor?

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:31.814
{\an8}Mortar, of course.

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:33.357
{\an8}- Auto-leveling?
- Yes.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:46.370
{\an8}- What ceiling finish did you decide on?
- Sheet molding compound.

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:48.372
{\an8}You had all the pipes
run through here too?

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:49.457
{\an8}Pretty much.

00:20:53.461 --> 00:20:55.671
What's the spacing
on the tied rebars here?

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:58.758
I'm not sure.
It should be in the blueprints.

00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:32.458
Here. You can look at this.

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:34.126
- The blueprints?
- Yes.

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:38.631
You're welcome.

00:21:41.467 --> 00:21:44.470
I don't think I've seen
the stair reinforcement blueprint here.

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:45.554
Me neither.

00:21:46.055 --> 00:21:47.389
They didn't show it to us.

00:21:47.473 --> 00:21:48.516
{\an8}Here's the blueprint.

00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:50.267
{\an8}We have on record that we sent it.

00:21:50.351 --> 00:21:52.394
- They didn't send it.
- We did.

00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:56.899
Look, here's the email history.

00:21:58.442 --> 00:21:59.652
Thank you, everyone.

00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:02.404
- I'll submit the inspection report.
- Okay, thank you.

00:22:02.488 --> 00:22:03.489
- Thank you.
- Okay.

00:22:05.282 --> 00:22:08.452
What was the original plan
for the access road surface again?

00:22:08.536 --> 00:22:10.830
{\an8}- That was…
- Asphalt concrete.

00:22:10.913 --> 00:22:13.207
{\an8}- What particle size?
- It was 13.

00:22:13.290 --> 00:22:15.209
{\an8}That's what it was from the start.

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:17.086
Thirteen? Thank you.

Where do you get this?

00:23:10.097 --> 00:23:11.098
How many weeks?

00:23:11.181 --> 00:23:12.725
It's been 32 weeks now.

00:23:13.475 --> 00:23:14.727
You're almost there.

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.770
It must be so hard for you. Right?

00:23:17.354 --> 00:23:19.690
Not at all. I'm okay for now.

00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:42.379
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:49.303
PREGNANT WOMEN FIRST

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.142
But seriously, where do you get this?

00:23:55.225 --> 00:23:56.560
Geez…

00:24:14.036 --> 00:24:15.287
Hey!

00:24:15.371 --> 00:24:17.122
Did someone suddenly make you do this?

00:24:17.206 --> 00:24:20.209
Attorney Ha asked us
to try writing a review memo.

00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:22.962
What are you doing? Let's go.

00:24:23.045 --> 00:24:25.172
- Sanggi, did you say this was due today?
- Yeah?

00:24:25.756 --> 00:24:27.758
Yeah. What is this?

00:24:27.841 --> 00:24:31.220
- Still not done? You had enough time.
- We won't make it to dinner.

00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:33.847
Just do it by tomorrow.

00:24:33.931 --> 00:24:36.266
Attorney Ha,
is it okay to finish it by tomorrow?

00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:38.185
By tomorrow…

00:24:38.268 --> 00:24:39.436
morning.

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.771
- Come on.
- Hey!

00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:43.399
Just take your time
and do it by the end of tomorrow.

00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:45.985
- Let's go! Move it!
- Hey.

00:24:46.068 --> 00:24:47.069
Where's Juhyeong?

00:24:47.653 --> 00:24:49.238
- He's meeting his friends.
- Right.

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:51.031
Hey, you got one.

00:24:51.615 --> 00:24:52.700
- Cute.
- It's cute.

00:24:53.367 --> 00:24:54.368
That's cute.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:57.246
- Long time no see!
- Long time no see!

00:25:01.208 --> 00:25:02.418
Juhyeong!

00:25:04.962 --> 00:25:06.005
Hey.

00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:08.340
You're here too?

00:25:08.424 --> 00:25:10.592
Did I not tell you?
I made sure he came today.

00:25:10.676 --> 00:25:11.844
Long time no see.

00:25:12.428 --> 00:25:13.512
Yeah, long time no see.

00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:17.141
Goodness, everyone's here on time.

00:25:17.224 --> 00:25:18.559
Jihun.

00:25:18.642 --> 00:25:20.185
When was the last time I saw you?

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:23.939
Was it early July 2021?

00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:26.525
You briefly joined us in Sinsa-dong

00:25:26.608 --> 00:25:28.110
and left before the second round.

00:25:28.193 --> 00:25:29.528
Wasn't that the last time?

00:25:30.571 --> 00:25:31.572
Was it?

00:25:31.655 --> 00:25:34.199
Why do you even remember stuff like that?

00:25:35.159 --> 00:25:37.036
How could I forget?

00:25:37.119 --> 00:25:39.538
I even remember
your karaoke song that night.

00:25:39.621 --> 00:25:40.956
Are you drinking makgeolli?

00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:42.249
- Yeah.
- No.

00:25:42.332 --> 00:25:45.210
Just drink makgeolli.
One makgeolli here, please!

00:25:45.294 --> 00:25:46.503
Okay!

00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:50.424
If I didn't know she was married,

00:25:50.507 --> 00:25:52.176
I don't need to worry, right?

00:25:52.843 --> 00:25:57.765
Juhyeong, what should I prepare
if I want the divorce to work in my favor?

00:25:59.099 --> 00:26:01.685
Is there a way I can get my money back?

00:26:03.896 --> 00:26:05.147
I need to use the restroom.

00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:06.315
- Okay.
- Sure.

00:26:07.775 --> 00:26:09.777
Your tie is so tacky…

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.862
- I need to go to the restroom too.
- Okay.

00:26:11.945 --> 00:26:13.197
It's the kind of thing…

00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:24.750
Juhyeong.

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:28.212
I've decided to give things

00:26:29.213 --> 00:26:30.881
another shot with my wife.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:35.469
I'm just thanking you.

00:26:35.552 --> 00:26:36.637
For what?

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:40.849
Remember what I asked you last time?
Things with my wife weren't great.

00:26:40.933 --> 00:26:42.518
You did?

00:26:43.769 --> 00:26:46.021
Sorry, I've been
all over the place lately.

00:26:48.148 --> 00:26:50.150
It's probably better
that you don't remember.

00:26:50.234 --> 00:26:52.277
Geez, you're the king
of being indifferent.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.114
I can't wear something that's cute?

00:26:55.739 --> 00:26:58.075
You're wearing pink at your age?

00:26:58.158 --> 00:27:00.119
So childish. Seriously.

00:27:00.202 --> 00:27:01.912
Geez, it's not right.

00:27:02.704 --> 00:27:06.250
How do all of you still look so good?

00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:07.751
Life must be treating you well?

00:27:07.835 --> 00:27:09.503
There's no reason it wouldn't be.

00:27:11.296 --> 00:27:12.548
Exactly.

00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:15.968
Our lives have usually been
smooth sailing.

00:27:16.051 --> 00:27:18.262
That's true. Except for him.

00:27:19.012 --> 00:27:20.639
- Him?
- What?

00:27:21.598 --> 00:27:24.685
Did things ever get sorted out?

00:27:27.396 --> 00:27:28.689
With what?

00:27:29.398 --> 00:27:32.359
- Your affair with that married woman.
- What?

00:27:35.904 --> 00:27:39.533
Hey, what was that head shake just now?
Unbelievable.

00:27:40.284 --> 00:27:41.326
I mean,

00:27:41.994 --> 00:27:45.330
if you had an affair with a married woman,
shaking your head makes sense.

00:27:45.414 --> 00:27:46.707
That's pretty messed up.

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:48.083
- Yeah.
- I told you

00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:49.918
I didn't know she was married.

00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:53.338
What kind of lawyer goes around
airing people's dirty laundry?

00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:58.260
I wondered why you showed up tonight.
Just to stir up drama?

00:27:58.343 --> 00:27:59.553
Wait, what?

00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:01.889
You told Juhyeong about it?

00:28:05.475 --> 00:28:07.644
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:28:07.728 --> 00:28:10.981
Then, where did you hear that?

00:28:11.064 --> 00:28:12.816
The word's spread all over our office.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.236
He's the hottest gossip
among office workers right now.

00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:18.447
- That was about him?
- It was him?

00:28:18.530 --> 00:28:22.868
Can you please tell people it's not me?

00:28:22.951 --> 00:28:25.329
I'm losing it because of that!

00:28:25.412 --> 00:28:28.916
I think you owe Juhyeong
an apology though.

00:28:30.876 --> 00:28:33.128
Hey, I'm sorry.

00:28:33.712 --> 00:28:35.088
- Do it right.
- You punk.

00:28:35.172 --> 00:28:37.841
Do it properly, you punk.
Be sincere, man.

00:28:37.925 --> 00:28:39.468
I'll handle it! Leave me alone.

00:28:39.551 --> 00:28:41.803
- It's fine.
- No, it's not…

00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:43.180
- Geez…
- Hey.

00:28:43.263 --> 00:28:44.306
Here.

00:28:44.389 --> 00:28:46.391
Let's cheers. Come on.

00:28:47.893 --> 00:28:50.270
- I'm tipsy.
- Anyways, good job today.

00:28:50.354 --> 00:28:52.689
Even though you drank,
go and look over some cases…

00:28:52.773 --> 00:28:53.857
- Stop!
- Hey!

00:28:53.941 --> 00:28:55.525
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

00:28:57.027 --> 00:28:59.237
- Thank you for the meal!
- Thank you for the meal!

00:29:00.489 --> 00:29:01.573
Anytime.

00:29:01.657 --> 00:29:04.159
Well, we'll head out first.

00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:05.285
- Bye.
- Get home safe.

00:29:05.369 --> 00:29:07.037
- Good job today.
- See you tomorrow.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.622
- See you tomorrow.
- Good night!

00:29:08.705 --> 00:29:09.706
Let's go.

00:29:12.751 --> 00:29:14.044
What?

00:29:14.127 --> 00:29:15.921
Did it end too soon? Up for round two?

00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:17.214
- Round two?
- Yeah.

00:29:17.297 --> 00:29:18.715
Sure. Where should we go?

00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:20.092
How about where Juhyeong is?

00:29:20.175 --> 00:29:21.218
Sure.

00:29:21.301 --> 00:29:23.971
When you started college,
you fell for that upperclassman

00:29:24.054 --> 00:29:25.722
and kept asking us what to do.

00:29:25.806 --> 00:29:27.849
- Seriously!
- Munjeong!

00:29:32.479 --> 00:29:34.356
- What's this?
- Did you drink a lot?

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:37.067
- Not at all.
- Hello.

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:38.485
- Congratulations!
- Munjeong!

00:29:38.568 --> 00:29:39.778
I'll introduce you.

00:29:39.861 --> 00:29:41.238
- It's okay.
- Come sit here!

00:29:41.321 --> 00:29:42.906
- Hello…
- Come here.

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:44.616
- Why?
- It's fine.

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:46.702
- We'll drink on our own.
- We're not joining?

00:29:46.785 --> 00:29:48.286
- No, sit here.
- See you later!

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:50.372
- Do you want to sit here?
- Sit here.

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:51.581
Be good to her, man.

00:29:51.665 --> 00:29:52.749
I am good to her.

00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:54.376
Hey, that person.

00:29:55.961 --> 00:29:59.172
The girl you met on your trip
when you were in law school.

00:29:59.256 --> 00:30:00.257
Isn't that her?

00:30:00.799 --> 00:30:02.175
Or does she just look similar?

00:30:05.178 --> 00:30:07.806
No, it is her! What's going on?

00:30:08.515 --> 00:30:10.350
Who? Attorney Kang?

00:30:13.228 --> 00:30:15.522
We just ended up
working in the same building.

00:30:15.605 --> 00:30:17.983
You told us back then
you met someone you liked.

00:30:18.066 --> 00:30:20.402
You were sending pictures
and asking us what to do.

00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:22.195
Wait, you two were a thing?

00:30:22.279 --> 00:30:23.739
No, we're just colleagues.

00:30:23.822 --> 00:30:25.574
- You know her too?
- Yeah, last time

00:30:25.657 --> 00:30:29.453
he called me out
late one night to help her out.

00:30:29.536 --> 00:30:31.329
Unbelievable.

00:30:31.413 --> 00:30:33.206
So, what's going on?

00:30:33.290 --> 00:30:36.126
- Are you trying to make it work again?
- Is that so?

00:30:36.209 --> 00:30:37.252
Not at all.

00:30:37.335 --> 00:30:39.087
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yeah.

00:30:39.755 --> 00:30:40.839
- Is he?
- I don't know.

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:44.760
No, it's true. I saw it.

00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:46.094
Then, introduce me to her.

00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:51.058
- What?
- No.

00:30:51.141 --> 00:30:52.601
Why not?

00:30:54.311 --> 00:30:56.688
She hates blind dates.
Hates them with a passion.

00:30:56.772 --> 00:31:00.442
So she prefers
to just let things happen naturally?

00:31:06.323 --> 00:31:08.533
Let's see each other
more often and not yearly.

00:31:08.617 --> 00:31:09.951
Yeah, we should.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:13.413
- You should quit sulking.
- I'm not sulking.

00:31:14.623 --> 00:31:17.125
Are you coming to the next meetup?

00:31:18.627 --> 00:31:21.463
Well, I'm not sure yet. We'll see.

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:22.964
Why? Should I not come?

00:31:23.757 --> 00:31:25.550
Come on.

00:31:25.634 --> 00:31:27.469
That's not what I meant.

00:31:28.762 --> 00:31:30.097
Munjeong!

00:31:33.767 --> 00:31:35.268
These are my old school buddies.

00:31:36.394 --> 00:31:37.729
These are my friends.

00:31:37.813 --> 00:31:39.981
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:31:40.065 --> 00:31:41.733
I was so grateful for the other day.

00:31:41.817 --> 00:31:44.069
But I couldn't make it to dinner.
I'm sorry.

00:31:44.152 --> 00:31:47.948
It's all right. Juhyeong paid that day.

00:31:48.865 --> 00:31:51.576
So there was a reason why you paid.

00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:55.872
Juhyeong's feelings for Attorney Kang…

00:31:56.456 --> 00:31:58.500
People often say I'm pretty clueless.

00:31:58.583 --> 00:31:59.960
Thinking back on it now,

00:32:00.043 --> 00:32:02.003
he's been into her since Hong Kong--

00:32:02.087 --> 00:32:04.214
Hey! Munjeong is looking for you.

00:32:04.297 --> 00:32:07.092
Hello, I'm Juhyeong's friend,
Min Jihun.

00:32:07.175 --> 00:32:08.844
I see. Hello.

00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:11.429
I heard you don't feel comfortable
with blind dates.

00:32:11.513 --> 00:32:13.098
Hey. Go home if you're drunk.

00:32:13.181 --> 00:32:15.642
Next time, I'll make sure once again…

00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:17.435
I'll say hello properly.

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:18.603
- We're off.
- Good night.

00:32:18.687 --> 00:32:20.021
- Bye!
- Good night!

00:32:20.105 --> 00:32:21.773
- Okay, bye.
- We're going too.

00:32:21.857 --> 00:32:23.150
- Bye.
- Get home safe.

00:32:23.233 --> 00:32:24.943
- Good night!
- Good night!

00:32:25.944 --> 00:32:28.071
- So, are you taking the bus?
- Yeah.

00:32:28.155 --> 00:32:29.698
I'm taking the bus tonight too.

00:32:29.781 --> 00:32:31.533
- Okay.
- Okay. We're taking…

00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:33.410
- The subway.
- Bye.

00:32:33.493 --> 00:32:35.620
- Okay. See you tomorrow.
- Bye!

00:32:38.665 --> 00:32:40.000
Should we go too?

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:52.179
- What was that about blind dates earlier?
- Blind dates…

00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:57.267
Jihun saw Attorney Kang at the bar
and asked to be introduced to her.

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:00.270
They mentioned
she didn't like blind dates.

00:33:00.896 --> 00:33:04.733
That's what Juhyeong said.
He said she hates them, so he said no.

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:07.110
That clever punk.

00:33:08.236 --> 00:33:10.071
- It's not true?
- Yeah, it is.

00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:12.073
Right? She gives off that vibe.

00:33:14.159 --> 00:33:15.493
What's that in your hand?

00:33:16.703 --> 00:33:18.496
- French fries.
- What?

00:33:19.289 --> 00:33:21.666
I noticed earlier you ate a lot of them.

00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:24.127
You've barely been able to eat
with morning sickness.

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:26.963
- Hey. So those are all fries?
- Yeah.

00:33:27.631 --> 00:33:28.882
Are you crazy?

00:33:29.966 --> 00:33:31.676
That's going to last us a week!

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:33.845
Okay. All right, I got it.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.974
Let me know if you need anything else.

00:33:38.058 --> 00:33:39.476
Tell me what happens.

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:41.686
Bye.

00:33:44.981 --> 00:33:47.234
- Is it a friend?
- Yes.

00:33:47.317 --> 00:33:50.111
Lately, a lot of friends
have been dealing with stuff.

00:33:50.612 --> 00:33:52.739
I'm getting a lot of calls
about legal advice.

00:33:53.323 --> 00:33:54.449
Are you very close?

00:33:55.659 --> 00:33:56.701
Fairly close.

00:33:58.662 --> 00:34:01.665
Then, don't ask
about how things turn out later.

00:34:02.457 --> 00:34:03.458
What?

00:34:03.959 --> 00:34:06.503
It's better to completely wipe it
from your memory.

00:34:07.587 --> 00:34:08.588
Why?

00:34:09.089 --> 00:34:10.548
You might drift apart.

00:34:11.925 --> 00:34:14.886
Still, it's a friend.
You should check in and see what happened.

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:18.473
If you act too indifferent,
won't you drift more apart?

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:21.268
You need to play dumb
the worse things are to prevent that.

00:34:21.351 --> 00:34:24.646
People might reach out and ask now
because they're desperate.

00:34:24.729 --> 00:34:26.982
But in the end,
they don't want to see anyone

00:34:27.065 --> 00:34:28.900
who knows about their misfortunes.

00:34:30.944 --> 00:34:31.945
Is that so?

00:34:51.673 --> 00:34:53.967
So, you didn't enjoy
today's gathering?

00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:55.760
- Do I look like it?
- A little.

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.763
That's strange.
I'm having a good time now.

00:34:59.306 --> 00:35:00.599
Why would I look like that?

00:35:01.182 --> 00:35:02.767
You do look happy now.

00:35:08.356 --> 00:35:10.525
Why did you tell them
I don't like blind dates?

00:35:12.736 --> 00:35:14.863
You must've had
a really good time in Hong Kong

00:35:15.447 --> 00:35:17.616
if your friends still remember it.

00:35:21.953 --> 00:35:25.040
- I'm not sure what you mean.
- I heard everything earlier.

00:35:28.627 --> 00:35:30.378
- Look, that was--
- So…

00:35:31.504 --> 00:35:33.048
when was your favorite moment?

00:35:49.397 --> 00:35:50.774
Do you…

00:35:52.525 --> 00:35:53.777
want to grab a bite?

00:35:58.114 --> 00:35:59.115
Okay.

00:36:20.929 --> 00:36:22.389
What do you want to eat?

00:36:27.811 --> 00:36:29.020
You speak English…

00:36:29.604 --> 00:36:32.148
I don't understand.
Could you speak Chinese?

00:36:32.232 --> 00:36:33.233
Well…

00:36:33.316 --> 00:36:34.317
Cantonese?

00:36:37.487 --> 00:36:39.781
This one…

00:36:44.953 --> 00:36:47.872
FOOD RECOMMENDATION

00:36:48.957 --> 00:36:52.794
These are fried eggs.
These are pork chops.

00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:54.713
And Swiss chicken wings. They're good.

00:36:54.796 --> 00:36:56.214
Are you okay with beef noodles?

00:36:56.297 --> 00:36:57.674
That sounds good.

00:36:58.425 --> 00:36:59.592
This is beef steak.

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:06.015
SWEET FOOD

00:37:06.099 --> 00:37:09.978
Sweet food! Okay, give me a moment.
I'll come back soon.

00:37:19.028 --> 00:37:21.698
Your English pronunciation is really good.

00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:26.703
I took classes here and there growing up.
I'm a piano major.

00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:33.251
I'm actually here for a gig
to fill in for a friend.

00:37:43.052 --> 00:37:45.805
You seem to know
a lot of Chinese characters too.

00:37:48.183 --> 00:37:51.102
- Law books have a lot of those, right?
- Well, no.

00:37:51.186 --> 00:37:53.605
I just studied a lot
of Classical Chinese as a kid.

00:38:06.284 --> 00:38:07.994
Is this your first time in Hong Kong?

00:38:08.578 --> 00:38:10.872
- Yes.
- Then, how did you find this place?

00:38:10.955 --> 00:38:12.582
From Comrades: Almost a Love Story.

00:38:12.665 --> 00:38:14.584
It looks similar
to a place from that film.

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:20.048
You don't like Hong Kong films?

00:38:20.924 --> 00:38:22.175
I'm not familiar.

00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:24.552
Hold on.

00:38:33.478 --> 00:38:35.230
These are all places from movies.

00:38:42.111 --> 00:38:44.113
You're planning to visit all of them?

00:38:47.867 --> 00:38:50.370
- Where are we now?
- Right now, we are…

00:38:51.246 --> 00:38:52.455
at our comrades' base.

00:38:54.082 --> 00:38:58.461
{\an8}This sweet food is for the beautiful lady.
And this is for the handsome guy.

00:39:01.464 --> 00:39:02.465
It looks delicious.

00:39:32.036 --> 00:39:33.204
Stop!

00:39:33.746 --> 00:39:34.831
- Why?
- Stop.

00:40:30.637 --> 00:40:31.638
Shall we go?

00:41:16.557 --> 00:41:17.558
By the way…

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.396
do you think we'll be together
back in Seoul?

00:41:25.858 --> 00:41:28.194
We agreed to meet up in Seoul.

00:41:31.322 --> 00:41:34.075
But we didn't actually
make any solid plans yet.

00:41:38.079 --> 00:41:43.418
Since we're on a trip, I thought maybe
we're just caught up in the mood and all.

00:42:07.066 --> 00:42:10.570
So, which moment did you like the most?

00:42:10.653 --> 00:42:12.488
Everything I just said.

00:42:12.989 --> 00:42:15.074
You asked when, so I told you.

00:42:15.658 --> 00:42:17.285
- All of it?
- Yes.

00:42:18.494 --> 00:42:19.495
What?

00:42:20.705 --> 00:42:22.290
But you don't remember this?

00:42:22.373 --> 00:42:25.376
I've had this on for ages.
You didn't see this?

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.627
Stop shaking it around.

00:42:26.711 --> 00:42:28.546
How could I not? I bought it for you.

00:43:14.717 --> 00:43:15.843
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:21.724
Therefore, the defendant is charged with

00:43:21.808 --> 00:43:24.018
aiding and abetting
unidentified individuals

00:43:24.102 --> 00:43:25.394
in a voice phishing scam.

00:43:28.106 --> 00:43:29.273
All right, Counsel.

00:43:29.357 --> 00:43:32.068
Please state your argument
on the charges and evidence.

00:43:33.569 --> 00:43:36.364
We deny the charges
and agree to all the evidence,

00:43:36.447 --> 00:43:38.282
but we dispute
what they intend to prove.

00:43:38.366 --> 00:43:39.575
All right, then.

00:43:39.659 --> 00:43:41.202
We'll review the evidence now.

00:43:53.089 --> 00:43:55.299
Okay, evidence review is complete.

00:43:55.383 --> 00:43:57.510
Prosecutor, state your sentencing request.

00:44:00.012 --> 00:44:02.640
- Yes, Counsel?
- We'll question the defendant.

00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:04.559
Question the defendant?

00:44:05.434 --> 00:44:06.894
It seems I hadn't asked that.

00:44:06.978 --> 00:44:08.771
But is that necessary?

00:44:08.855 --> 00:44:11.315
Let's save your comments
for the final argument.

00:44:11.899 --> 00:44:15.820
Yes, but I'd like to ask the court
to allow the defendant a chance to explain

00:44:15.903 --> 00:44:17.155
what happened at the time.

00:44:23.452 --> 00:44:26.289
Defendant, when you first received
the loan advertisement text,

00:44:26.372 --> 00:44:28.666
you thought it came
from a real bank, correct?

00:44:28.749 --> 00:44:29.792
Yes.

00:44:30.918 --> 00:44:32.879
When someone posing as a bank employee

00:44:32.962 --> 00:44:35.298
promised a loan
by making your transaction history,

00:44:35.381 --> 00:44:36.632
you believed them, correct?

00:44:36.716 --> 00:44:42.471
Yes, I didn't even realize it was a lie
until the police investigation.

00:44:42.555 --> 00:44:45.057
In the end,
you didn't benefit from this, right?

00:44:45.141 --> 00:44:48.227
No, they never gave me the loan.

00:44:48.311 --> 00:44:50.271
I didn't receive anything.

00:44:50.354 --> 00:44:53.691
You were deceived by the person
posing as Baek Jeonghyeon, correct?

00:44:53.774 --> 00:44:55.401
Yes, I think so.

00:44:56.819 --> 00:44:57.987
No further questions.

00:44:59.363 --> 00:45:01.324
Prosecutor,
would you like to cross-examine?

00:45:01.407 --> 00:45:03.075
Yes. Just one question, Your Honor.

00:45:03.951 --> 00:45:04.994
Defendant.

00:45:05.953 --> 00:45:08.122
You asked that unidentified person

00:45:08.206 --> 00:45:11.292
if this was voice phishing or not,
correct?

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:13.127
Yeah, that's true.

00:45:13.211 --> 00:45:14.212
No further questions.

00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:18.549
Redirect, Your Honor.

00:45:18.633 --> 00:45:20.301
Yes, please keep it brief.

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:23.429
When the defendant asked that question,

00:45:23.512 --> 00:45:25.640
that person said it wasn't voice phishing

00:45:25.723 --> 00:45:27.558
and to stop
if you didn't want the loan?

00:45:27.642 --> 00:45:29.518
Yes, he clearly said it wasn't a scam.

00:45:29.602 --> 00:45:32.480
You asked if it was voice phishing,

00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:35.691
because you were worried
they'd ask you for money too, correct?

00:45:36.275 --> 00:45:37.443
Yes, that's right.

00:45:37.526 --> 00:45:41.072
I wondered for a moment
if he was trying to scam me out of money,

00:45:41.155 --> 00:45:44.283
but he didn't ask for any,
so I figured it wasn't a scam.

00:45:44.367 --> 00:45:47.036
He even said he'd use his own money

00:45:47.119 --> 00:45:50.623
to help make my transaction history,
so I was grateful.

00:45:50.706 --> 00:45:52.208
- No further questions.
- All right.

00:45:52.291 --> 00:45:54.543
Defendant, you may return to your seat.

00:45:56.379 --> 00:45:58.673
Prosecutor, your sentencing request?

00:45:59.924 --> 00:46:00.925
Yes, Your Honor.

00:46:02.885 --> 00:46:03.886
We request

00:46:04.845 --> 00:46:07.223
a fine of 15 million won
for the defendant.

00:46:11.852 --> 00:46:13.437
Counsel, present your statement.

00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:22.238
Your Honor, Ms. Do Mikyung
was facing severe financial hardship.

00:46:22.738 --> 00:46:24.907
So a loan offer
despite her low credit rating

00:46:24.991 --> 00:46:26.575
couldn't help but be appealing.

00:46:27.326 --> 00:46:30.830
It was more than appealing.
To her, it felt like a lifeline.

00:46:30.913 --> 00:46:34.041
Since those behind voice phishing scams
are hard to catch,

00:46:34.125 --> 00:46:36.210
we fully agree
with the prosecution's stance

00:46:36.294 --> 00:46:38.462
on cracking down
on money mules as a deterrent.

00:46:38.546 --> 00:46:42.675
However, using that single question
of asking if it's voice phishing or not

00:46:42.758 --> 00:46:47.221
as grounds to apply dolus eventualis
and charge someone who had no idea

00:46:47.305 --> 00:46:50.641
they were being used as a money mule
as an accomplice

00:46:50.725 --> 00:46:52.184
is excessive and unjust.

00:46:53.561 --> 00:46:56.022
She was deceived
into withdrawing the cash.

00:46:56.105 --> 00:46:59.150
That call was fully recorded
and transcribed in the evidence.

00:46:59.233 --> 00:47:00.776
The prosecution also knows this,

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:03.612
as reflected
in the relatively light sentence.

00:47:08.659 --> 00:47:10.953
You may think,
"Still, how could she not know?"

00:47:11.037 --> 00:47:15.499
But not everyone understands
how these scams work.

00:47:15.583 --> 00:47:18.419
They may not know,
so that's exactly how they're tricked.

00:47:19.628 --> 00:47:21.756
But not knowing cannot be a crime.

00:47:23.799 --> 00:47:25.926
Therefore, we ask the court to recognize

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:31.390
that the defendant lacked any intent
to aid in fraud and find her not guilty.

00:47:31.474 --> 00:47:32.725
That is all.

00:47:37.021 --> 00:47:38.773
TRANSCRIPTS

00:47:53.204 --> 00:47:55.164
"Specific review…"

00:47:55.247 --> 00:47:56.999
"One. Grounds for termination…"

00:47:57.083 --> 00:48:00.127
Things like this. I just caught one.

00:48:00.795 --> 00:48:03.381
{\an8}That's not how you spell "contract."

00:48:03.464 --> 00:48:06.384
- Kind of ridiculous, right?
- I'm sorry.

00:48:06.467 --> 00:48:08.969
Make sure to proofread thoroughly
before submitting.

00:48:09.053 --> 00:48:10.888
I'll keep an eye out next time too.

00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:11.972
Next…

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.058
I'm sorry.

00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:15.393
Sorry, I'm late.

00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:20.689
Are you joining us today?

00:48:20.773 --> 00:48:22.733
I'd like to take the class as well.

00:48:22.817 --> 00:48:25.361
- Is that okay?
- Of course. We were just about to start.

00:48:25.444 --> 00:48:27.071
Okay.

00:48:27.154 --> 00:48:28.239
Okay.

00:48:28.322 --> 00:48:32.952
You wrote, "Whether the barbecue area
can remain in place or not

00:48:33.035 --> 00:48:36.288
in the sale of a vacation home
is a key factor of the contract." Right?

00:48:36.372 --> 00:48:38.999
Yes. In Korea,
when people rent vacation homes,

00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:41.377
a barbecue area is pretty much a given.

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:44.672
So I believe not being able to keep it

00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:48.843
justified a cancellation of the contract.

00:48:48.926 --> 00:48:50.177
Correct. Give him a hand.

00:48:50.970 --> 00:48:51.971
Thank you!

00:48:53.305 --> 00:48:54.598
- Or is it?
- Sorry?

00:48:54.682 --> 00:48:55.808
What do you think?

00:48:55.891 --> 00:48:58.102
I thought the contract should still stand.

00:48:58.185 --> 00:49:01.480
The vacation home business
is officially registered as lodging.

00:49:01.564 --> 00:49:04.066
That takes priority,
and everything else is secondary.

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:09.822
I think the ratio of the barbecue area
to the entire property area matters,

00:49:10.698 --> 00:49:12.908
- but there's no data on that.
- Ratio of area?

00:49:13.659 --> 00:49:15.995
That is an interesting take, isn't it?

00:49:16.078 --> 00:49:19.415
Or it might be
a completely irrelevant take.

00:49:19.498 --> 00:49:20.499
What about you?

00:49:20.583 --> 00:49:23.919
I think the key
is whether the barbecue area's value

00:49:24.003 --> 00:49:26.547
was reflected in the sale price

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:29.842
at the time of the contract agreement.

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:31.927
Good point.

00:49:32.011 --> 00:49:35.764
But isn't anyone
going to mention the mistake of motive?

00:49:35.848 --> 00:49:37.141
You would've studied this.

00:49:37.224 --> 00:49:39.310
MISTAKE ABOUT REASON
FOR MAKING A LEGAL ACT

00:49:39.393 --> 00:49:40.519
Yes, Ms. Kim.

00:49:40.603 --> 00:49:42.062
I have studied it before.

00:49:43.522 --> 00:49:45.483
This is bad, folks.

00:49:45.566 --> 00:49:49.153
Even our non-lawyer advisor knew it.
That's a problem.

00:49:49.236 --> 00:49:50.404
By tomorrow,

00:49:50.488 --> 00:49:53.365
each of you should prepare
10 different mistake of motive cases.

00:49:53.449 --> 00:49:55.659
No duplicates.

00:49:56.243 --> 00:49:57.703
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:49:59.079 --> 00:50:00.456
Yes, Ms. Kim?

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:03.626
I'm a law school grad too.

00:50:04.418 --> 00:50:05.419
Is that so?

00:50:06.295 --> 00:50:09.173
Then, I'd like you to prepare
10 cases by tomorrow as well.

00:50:09.256 --> 00:50:10.799
- What?
- By tomorrow.

00:50:10.883 --> 00:50:11.926
- But I--
- No overlaps.

00:50:12.843 --> 00:50:14.053
- Wait--
- Okay, next.

00:50:14.136 --> 00:50:15.513
Attorney Ha, I…

00:50:16.472 --> 00:50:18.307
Wait, that's…

00:50:39.453 --> 00:50:41.121
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:50:45.918 --> 00:50:46.919
That was brutal.

00:50:47.795 --> 00:50:49.630
- Gosh, good work!
- It's still wrong.

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:52.299
My goodness.

00:50:52.383 --> 00:50:55.261
- Ms. Kim was here too?
- Yeah, but she ran away.

00:50:55.344 --> 00:50:57.054
- Why?
- Because I gave her homework.

00:50:57.137 --> 00:50:58.180
Thank you.

00:50:58.264 --> 00:50:59.557
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

00:51:00.099 --> 00:51:02.434
I told you not to go overboard
with the highlighter.

00:51:02.935 --> 00:51:04.645
Have you seen this case too?

00:51:05.187 --> 00:51:06.605
Yes, we have.

00:51:06.689 --> 00:51:09.358
But anyone could see
that case was clearly a scam.

00:51:09.441 --> 00:51:12.820
Do people actually fall
for scams like fools that way?

00:51:13.821 --> 00:51:15.406
I found that case weird too.

00:51:15.489 --> 00:51:16.949
- Can you not tell?
- Right?

00:51:17.032 --> 00:51:18.867
Getting fooled like that is their fault.

00:51:19.994 --> 00:51:21.495
Anyone can be fooled.

00:51:33.465 --> 00:51:34.466
That's why

00:51:35.593 --> 00:51:37.052
you all need to be careful too.

00:51:38.721 --> 00:51:39.722
Please, drink.

00:51:39.805 --> 00:51:41.765
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:51:41.849 --> 00:51:42.850
It looks tasty.

00:51:54.653 --> 00:51:56.905
I'm surprised
you reached out first this time.

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:00.743
I'm sorry.

00:52:01.368 --> 00:52:05.289
I brought the final version
of the blueprints,

00:52:05.372 --> 00:52:08.626
the construction breakdown,
and the contract.

00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:13.005
I asked for these ages ago.
You can't bring these to me now.

00:52:13.839 --> 00:52:16.008
I have no excuse.

00:52:17.468 --> 00:52:19.553
You can curse at me all you want.

00:52:19.637 --> 00:52:22.431
Still, how could I ever do that?

00:52:22.514 --> 00:52:25.392
{\an8}This needs to be added
to the progress valuation.

00:52:25.476 --> 00:52:27.478
{\an8}Is it too late?

00:52:27.561 --> 00:52:30.814
The assessment's already done.
I can't add anything now.

00:52:35.194 --> 00:52:37.780
I just…

00:52:43.911 --> 00:52:46.997
Just thinking about not getting paid
makes my blood boil.

00:52:50.918 --> 00:52:54.088
I didn't want to keep dwelling on it,
so I didn't notice I avoided it…

00:52:55.798 --> 00:52:57.049
and ended up here.

00:52:58.092 --> 00:52:59.301
I'm sorry.

00:53:03.138 --> 00:53:04.807
What were you supposed to add?

00:53:06.725 --> 00:53:10.938
{\an8}Well, the ceiling and roof
were supposed to use deck plates,

00:53:11.021 --> 00:53:13.565
{\an8}- but that changed--
- I added that one.

00:53:14.566 --> 00:53:16.527
- You did?
- Yes.

00:53:16.610 --> 00:53:19.613
The construction documents
listed "deck plate,"

00:53:19.697 --> 00:53:22.032
but when I checked the site,
they didn't match.

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:26.245
Here. You can look at this.

00:53:26.328 --> 00:53:28.414
So I added that to the valuation myself.

00:53:29.164 --> 00:53:31.458
I see. And the stairs--

00:53:31.542 --> 00:53:33.001
I added that too.

00:53:33.085 --> 00:53:35.921
There were two versions
of the stair reinforcement blueprint.

00:53:36.004 --> 00:53:38.549
The latter one
showed a different rebar count,

00:53:38.632 --> 00:53:40.467
so I added that to the valuation too.

00:53:40.551 --> 00:53:43.429
I don't think I've seen
the stair reinforcement blueprint here.

00:53:43.512 --> 00:53:44.555
Here's the blueprint.

00:53:44.638 --> 00:53:46.515
We have on record that we sent it.

00:53:48.767 --> 00:53:50.978
Thank you, Attorney Bae.

00:53:52.146 --> 00:53:54.690
How did you figure all that out
just from the documents

00:53:54.773 --> 00:53:56.191
without any explanation?

00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:58.277
That's why

00:53:59.111 --> 00:54:01.113
I need you to be
more responsive from now on.

00:54:03.407 --> 00:54:05.075
I know this has been tough,

00:54:05.159 --> 00:54:07.911
but you won't feel any relief
until you get paid.

00:54:07.995 --> 00:54:10.372
That's not going to happen
any other way. Right?

00:54:13.208 --> 00:54:15.252
I'll do everything I can
until the very end.

00:54:18.046 --> 00:54:19.047
Okay.

00:54:20.424 --> 00:54:22.092
Thank you, Attorney Bae.

00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:25.471
Thank you.

00:54:43.739 --> 00:54:45.282
This one looks good too.

00:54:47.868 --> 00:54:49.036
Should I get out first?

00:54:49.536 --> 00:54:50.662
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:54:59.004 --> 00:55:00.881
Hello.

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:02.508
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:55:02.591 --> 00:55:04.009
Should we put these over here?

00:55:08.138 --> 00:55:09.431
It's heavy. I'll take it.

00:55:09.515 --> 00:55:11.391
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:55:12.226 --> 00:55:13.519
What's all this?

00:55:13.602 --> 00:55:16.063
I just wanted to wish you
a Happy Lunar New Year.

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:17.856
I'll put them here. Please take one.

00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:20.776
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:55:20.859 --> 00:55:22.528
Happy New Year.

00:55:22.611 --> 00:55:25.113
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

00:55:25.197 --> 00:55:26.698
- Have a nice day.
- Goodbye.

00:55:28.867 --> 00:55:30.327
These must be very expensive.

00:55:30.410 --> 00:55:32.162
- What are they?
- They're quite big.

00:55:32.246 --> 00:55:34.831
- This is awesome.
- It's so heavy.

00:55:34.915 --> 00:55:36.500
Wow, are these fruits?

00:55:36.583 --> 00:55:37.918
- Open it.
- Is it Korean beef?

00:55:38.669 --> 00:55:39.962
Big companies are great.

00:55:40.796 --> 00:55:41.838
What are those?

00:55:41.922 --> 00:55:44.258
Okay, I'm going to open it.

00:55:46.468 --> 00:55:47.594
My goodness!

00:55:50.722 --> 00:55:52.182
My goodness!

00:55:55.978 --> 00:55:57.187
They're alive.

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:05.445
MANAGING PARTNER KIM RYUJIN

00:56:06.363 --> 00:56:09.199
What was she startled by?
Was it the lobster?

00:56:09.283 --> 00:56:10.659
Or was it me?

00:56:12.119 --> 00:56:13.328
Gosh.

00:56:21.003 --> 00:56:22.004
Ms. Kim.

00:56:22.087 --> 00:56:23.672
- Are you going home?
- Hello.

00:56:25.591 --> 00:56:28.218
You shouldn't have done all this.

00:56:28.302 --> 00:56:30.762
Well, I just wanted to wish you
a Happy Lunar New Year.

00:56:30.846 --> 00:56:32.097
Thank you for the gift.

00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:33.223
Sure.

00:56:35.392 --> 00:56:38.312
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to find more cases for you.

00:56:38.395 --> 00:56:39.980
Sure.

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:43.400
we were really part of the same firm
if I helped out more.

00:56:46.361 --> 00:56:48.530
I'm sure you'll help us out well
in the future.

00:57:00.459 --> 00:57:02.753
Ms. Kim, thank you for the gift.

00:57:02.836 --> 00:57:05.714
You're welcome. I wanted to wish you
a Happy Lunar New Year.

00:57:05.797 --> 00:57:07.090
Thank you for the lobster.

00:57:07.174 --> 00:57:08.884
Of course. Happy New Year.

00:57:08.967 --> 00:57:10.510
- Happy New Year.
- All right.

00:57:11.511 --> 00:57:12.638
Ms. Kim.

00:57:13.305 --> 00:57:14.514
Thank you for the gift!

00:57:15.432 --> 00:57:17.142
And it's lobster! Thank you!

00:57:17.225 --> 00:57:18.935
Yes, Happy New Year.

00:57:19.019 --> 00:57:20.520
- Happy New Year.
- All right.

00:57:21.647 --> 00:57:23.482
- I'll get going first.
- Yes, all right.

00:57:23.565 --> 00:57:25.108
Happy New Year.

00:57:25.651 --> 00:57:26.693
Yes, all right.

00:57:35.535 --> 00:57:37.287
Could I add some avocados?

00:57:38.497 --> 00:57:40.707
I'll have honey oat bread.

00:57:41.875 --> 00:57:43.627
I'll add extra shrimp and cheese too.

00:57:45.337 --> 00:57:46.672
Make that American cheese.

00:57:51.843 --> 00:57:54.513
I'll have the same one.
Make it a footlong, please.

00:58:09.528 --> 00:58:12.155
Hey, this is good. It's nice.

00:58:12.239 --> 00:58:14.825
Hey, are you all going home
for the holidays?

00:58:14.908 --> 00:58:16.451
- Of course.
- Yeah?

00:58:16.535 --> 00:58:17.536
Hey.

00:58:17.619 --> 00:58:20.080
I bet they stop nagging you
about having a baby now.

00:58:20.163 --> 00:58:21.623
I haven't told them yet.

00:58:21.707 --> 00:58:24.126
- Why not?
- Why is that such a secret with you?

00:58:24.209 --> 00:58:25.585
I'll tell them soon.

00:58:25.669 --> 00:58:28.130
This time,
I'm escaping the nagging for good.

00:58:29.005 --> 00:58:31.299
I got rid
of the marriage nagging long ago.

00:58:32.426 --> 00:58:36.012
Once I get past the baby stuff,
it's total freedom from nagging.

00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:39.766
But do your families really ask
why you're not married?

00:58:39.850 --> 00:58:40.934
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:42.018
Your folks don't ask?

00:58:42.102 --> 00:58:43.186
They don't.

00:58:43.729 --> 00:58:45.689
You may be the youngest in this group.

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.525
But you'll start hearing it soon.

00:58:48.608 --> 00:58:51.194
My parents aren't the type
to nag about that stuff.

00:58:52.863 --> 00:58:56.074
In my family, my dad's the one
who always brings it up.

00:58:56.158 --> 00:58:57.200
Me too.

00:58:57.284 --> 00:58:59.953
My mom always lobs it up,
and my dad takes the swing.

00:59:00.036 --> 00:59:02.456
Me too. Wow! It's totally the same.

00:59:02.539 --> 00:59:04.332
I'm jealous. I don't have a dad.

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:07.461
Damn it.

00:59:09.045 --> 00:59:11.298
Don't make jokes with stuff like that.

00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:13.884
- Geez, Sanggi! Cut it out.
- Ouch!

00:59:14.468 --> 00:59:15.469
Father!

00:59:17.471 --> 00:59:18.972
- How old are you?
- Geez.

00:59:19.055 --> 00:59:22.184
- It's freezing.
- It's so cold!

00:59:22.267 --> 00:59:23.935
- It's so cold.
- Gosh!

00:59:24.478 --> 00:59:27.522
I guess we'll see each other
after the holidays.

00:59:27.606 --> 00:59:29.691
- Get some good rest for once.
- All right.

00:59:29.775 --> 00:59:30.817
Don't miss me and cry.

00:59:30.901 --> 00:59:32.444
- Go on, now.
- See you!

00:59:32.527 --> 00:59:33.653
- Bye!
- Bye!

00:59:34.696 --> 00:59:36.072
It's so cold!

00:59:40.744 --> 00:59:41.870
What? What is it?

00:59:41.953 --> 00:59:42.954
Nothing.

00:59:45.957 --> 00:59:47.959
Lobster!

00:59:48.752 --> 00:59:50.921
- What?
- Lobster!

00:59:51.004 --> 00:59:52.422
Jiseok loves lobster.

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:04.643
By the way, do you have any thoughts
about getting married?

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:07.646
Why are you shocked?

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:10.106
What's with you?
You're not that kind of person, Mom.

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:11.691
Can't I even ask that?

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:12.818
Dad.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.694
Not interested in marriage?

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:16.822
Dad!

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:38.218
Mom, when's Junki coming?

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:39.761
He's coming tomorrow.

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:42.180
Where are you going?

01:00:42.264 --> 01:00:43.390
I have to go to work.

01:00:44.850 --> 01:00:45.851
But it's New Year's.

01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:47.727
It's our busiest time.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:50.856
Put that in the fridge, please.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.108
- Okay.
- I'm off.

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:12.794
That's the best news
I've heard in a while!

01:01:12.878 --> 01:01:16.047
- I did well, right?
- Are you planning for a second right away?

01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:19.634
What? No, this is my first pregnancy.
Why are you mentioning a second?

01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:22.137
At your age,
how can we not mention a second kid?

01:01:22.721 --> 01:01:23.763
Dad.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.473
What about work then?

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:28.560
Can you take maternity leave
or parental leave?

01:01:28.643 --> 01:01:32.230
Come, now. She's a lawyer.
What are you even worried about?

01:01:32.314 --> 01:01:34.232
Geez, everyone just be quiet.

01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:35.483
I'll handle it.

01:01:37.652 --> 01:01:39.321
Uncle Changwon, buy us ice cream.

01:01:39.404 --> 01:01:41.698
Buy us some ice cream.

01:01:41.781 --> 01:01:44.242
- Hey.
- Uncle Changwon!

01:01:44.326 --> 01:01:47.078
- Buy us some ice cream.
- Buy us some ice cream.

01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:49.623
All right. I'll buy you some ice cream.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:51.666
Go sit down. I'll get you some soon.

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:57.505
Changwon.

01:01:58.381 --> 01:01:59.382
Yes?

01:02:00.508 --> 01:02:01.968
I'll call you later.

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:04.262
Here, read this,

01:02:04.346 --> 01:02:06.306
and pretend you're my lawyer.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:07.432
Try to make a case.

01:02:08.016 --> 01:02:11.519
- Make a case?
- Pretend you're in court. Try it out.

01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:13.521
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.

01:02:13.605 --> 01:02:15.482
Do I need to give you a retaining fee?

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.567
No, it's not that.

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:20.487
Yeah, you do this all the time.
You can tell easily, right?

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.459
It looks so good. Eat up!

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:37.545
- It looks delicious.
- It does.

01:02:37.629 --> 01:02:39.839
When should we go to your aunt's tomorrow?

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:43.635
I think I need
to stop by the office tomorrow.

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:45.971
Are you that busy?

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:49.224
I just have a bunch
of little things to take care of.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.310
Okay. Bye.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:01.069
What are you doing here?

01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:03.488
I thought you'd be glued
to your parents all break.

01:03:04.072 --> 01:03:05.865
There's not much to do at home.

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:08.410
I guess I'm a full-fledged lawyer now.

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:10.704
The office just feels more peaceful.

01:03:12.122 --> 01:03:13.164
How about you?

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:16.710
Well, I've been a lawyer for a long time.

01:03:27.846 --> 01:03:28.888
Do you…

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:30.974
want to grab a bite?

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:33.768
Sure.

01:03:36.604 --> 01:03:37.605
This way?

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:39.691
Here?

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:44.029
Don't you smell something delicious?

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:46.990
I've been frying jeon all day.

01:03:47.657 --> 01:03:49.200
Doesn't your family make jeon?

01:03:49.284 --> 01:03:50.785
We make dumplings.

01:03:51.286 --> 01:03:53.288
- Dumplings?
- Don't you smell dumplings?

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:57.459
How would clothes
ever smell like dumplings?

01:03:58.251 --> 01:04:02.839
- You know, like from dumpling hot pot.
- I see. So you had dumpling hot pot?

01:04:03.631 --> 01:04:05.050
We had hot pot and…

01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:11.765
Gosh, even this place is empty now.

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:14.309
Right? Every place is closed.

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:17.020
Maybe places
near Gangnam Station are open?

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:19.689
Wow, Gangnam Station.

01:04:21.316 --> 01:04:23.902
I know a place there
that's open for 24 hours.

01:04:25.028 --> 01:04:26.988
On the night you stood me up,

01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:29.699
I was so cold
I ended up eating there alone.

01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:33.036
It's still around,
and I get angry every time I pass by.

01:04:36.456 --> 01:04:37.916
No wonder I couldn't find you.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:40.085
What?

01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:42.879
Well…

01:04:44.089 --> 01:04:45.507
I went to Gangnam Station too.

01:04:46.508 --> 01:04:47.509
You're lying.

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.554
I'm not like you. Why would I lie?

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:53.056
Why are you saying this now?

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:56.351
Well, I missed the right moment to say it.

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:03.441
I still can't believe it.

01:05:05.193 --> 01:05:08.196
How could you possibly take that
as me canceling?

01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:10.573
No, we definitely agreed to meet,

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:12.784
but then, you asked if we'd be together.

01:05:12.867 --> 01:05:15.537
In my mind, I was basically
confessing my feelings for you.

01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:18.248
We were running out of time together.

01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:22.168
You even said we should meet in Seoul,
but you still didn't ask me out.

01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:30.260
Next time, whatever it is,
say it clearly so I can understand.

01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:34.514
Next time when?

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:51.406
Now?

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:11.259
Is that clear enough?

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:17.849
Do you think I'm an idiot?

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:05.438
So, what do you want to eat?

01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:11.653
Acai bowl.

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:12.779
Acai bowl?

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.447
- What's this?
- What on earth?

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:19.661
What?

01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:22.247
- What are you doing here?
- What's going on?

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:25.375
- Did you make plans without me?
- Don't be ridiculous.

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:26.918
Why are you here?

01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:28.878
- Where's your husband?
- He's asleep.

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:30.588
Hold on.

01:07:30.672 --> 01:07:32.799
Then, did we run into each other
by chance?

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.717
Why is he so excited?

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:36.427
It's exciting! It feels like fate!

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:38.680
- Geez.
- Geez.

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:40.014
Perfect. It's snowing too.

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:44.102
I can't believe nothing was open.

01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:46.938
You said it was open 24 hours.

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:48.940
I never said 365 days a year.

01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:50.024
Geez.

01:07:56.572 --> 01:07:58.741
Hey, what are you all doing?

01:07:59.534 --> 01:08:00.535
What?

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:01.703
What's up with you two?

01:08:01.786 --> 01:08:03.329
Did you make plans without us?

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:07.417
No, I was here first.
And then, Juhyeong showed up too.

01:08:08.584 --> 01:08:11.796
Well, I was on my way to the office,
and she was standing outside.

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:15.091
- What does that mean?
- Suspicious.

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:16.301
Whatever. Just eat.

01:08:16.384 --> 01:08:18.344
- I want that one.
- Yeah.

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:21.848
I was worried two pies would be too much,
but it worked out. Let's eat.

01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:24.058
Hey, aren't you curious
why we're all here?

01:08:24.142 --> 01:08:25.226
It's obvious.

01:08:26.561 --> 01:08:28.104
I didn't take a picture. Hold on.

01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:30.648
I took one earlier. I'll send it to you.

01:08:31.316 --> 01:08:33.067
I have my own artistic style though.

01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:36.529
- I took a good one.
- Thanks.

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:47.623
It's nice to be in the break room again.

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:48.833
You're right.

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:51.586
This place feels the most comfortable.

01:08:59.177 --> 01:09:00.970
It's really snowing a lot.

01:09:53.981 --> 01:09:55.024
Hi, Mom.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:58.027
What?

01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:22.528
Law and The City

01:11:50.890 --> 01:11:54.602
Law and The City

01:11:54.685 --> 01:11:56.437
{\an8}You should've told me about this!

01:11:56.521 --> 01:11:59.690
{\an8}What do you mean there's nothing?
You got it through Park!

01:11:59.774 --> 01:12:01.567
{\an8}- It couldn't be…
- Her father…

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:02.944
{\an8}was in jail.

01:12:04.195 --> 01:12:05.530
{\an8}Are you okay?

01:12:05.613 --> 01:12:07.406
{\an8}You're going through a lot.

01:12:08.866 --> 01:12:10.451
{\an8}You're not defending this, right?

01:12:10.535 --> 01:12:11.911
{\an8}Dad.

01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:14.455
{\an8}Don't come back anymore. Okay?

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:19.418
{\an8}Wait, you think this contract is legit?

01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:23.256
{\an8}It's Huiji's father.
Aren't you being too impersonal?

01:12:24.215 --> 01:12:25.800
{\an8}I'm visiting as his attorney.

01:12:25.883 --> 01:12:28.344
{\an8}Please tell him to come out. Please.

01:12:36.269 --> 01:12:38.271
