WEBVTT

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:12.279
Dad

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:13.919
Apple Tech is really dropping.

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:14.679
Look, quick!

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:15.800
Why are you panicking?

00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:18.160
Is this your first day trading stocks?

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.679
Let me tell you,

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.760
A small dip just shakes out the retail investors.

00:00:21.879 --> 00:00:23.519
Then it can keep rising.

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:24.879
It's not a small dip.

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:26.120
It's crashing!

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.079
What's going on?

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:31.600
Bro, don't be scared.

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:33.640
It should just be a technical correction.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.880
No, no.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.079
Something big has happened.

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.039
Apple Tech has exploded online.

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:39.679
They're said to owe over a hundred billion.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.039
Their assets can't cover their debts.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.240
Hurry!

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.840
Sell all our stocks

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.479
Get rid of all of them.

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:46.320
Trading has been halted.

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:47.880
We can't sell a single share.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.119
What do we do? What now?

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.920
Honey

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.439
We invested twenty million in this!

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.320
This...

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.159
What on earth is going on?

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.079
Didn't you see?

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.920
I made one call and crashed it to a halt.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.079
A company like Apple Tech

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:01.079
It's better if it collapses sooner.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.280
That way, it won't hurt more people.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.200
Bro, be serious.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.120
That's a Fortune Global 500 company.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.480
You're just a delivery guy,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.719
how could you possibly make it collapse?

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:11.280
Did you really crash Apple Tech's trading?

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:12.519
You...

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:14.159
Who are you, really?

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.840
Wife

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.200
Tell them

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.599
My husband is Gao Feng, the president of Junsheng Group

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:30.719
This

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.200
Gao Feng

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.840
How is that possible

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:35.959
Gao Feng

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.400
Are you really Gao Feng

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.439
That's me

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.959
Our Su family is just a small family in Yuncheng

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:51.840
We don't even qualify to do business with Junsheng Group

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.040
President Gao is a giant in the business world

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:58.040
How could he marry a woman from our Su family

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.040
As the saying goes

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.079
Even heroes fall for beautiful women

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.200
With looks like this

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:06.920
It's reasonable that I was attracted to her

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.280
With President Gao's global fame and influence

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:12.439
Your marriage

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.400
should have been big news

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.719
But

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:18.639
there wasn't any news at all

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.039
Everyone knows

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.240
I don't like being high-profile

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.319
It's reasonable not to make the wedding public

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:24.400
That makes sense too

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:27.199
Alright

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.680
That actually makes sense

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:29.759
It really does make sense

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.120
If you don't believe it

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.639
I can have him put on a mask

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:37.599
and show you

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:00.840
Oh wow

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.120
He really does look like him

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.280
You really are Gao Feng

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.319
President Gao

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.199
Big Brother

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.520
Stop being so suspicious.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.039
President Gao marrying our Qingyan

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.639
is a tremendous blessing for our Su family.

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:19.159
Yes, yes, absolutely.

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:21.039
I never even dreamed of this.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.240
I can't believe we can become relatives with President Gao.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.840
That's right.

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:26.280
Qingyan, honestly!

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.039
Why didn't you introduce him to us earlier?

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:29.719
President Gao,

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:30.120
President Gao.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.039
Please, have a seat.

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.240
Quick, quick, please take a seat, please take a seat.

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.840
Come, come, come.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.759
Come.

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.759
That's wonderful.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.159
Honey,

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:38.840
how was it?

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.800
I acted pretty well, didn't I?

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.039
I didn't expect you to be this good.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.840
But remember,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.919
don't exaggerate too much.

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:44.879
Otherwise, it'll be hard to wrap things up.

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:45.400
Got it?

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.199
OK.

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.879
Mr. Gao,

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.360
sorry for not being a good host earlier.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.960
Please don't take it to heart.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.280
For my wife's sake,

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:54.479
I won't hold it against you.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.080
That's just like you, Mr. Gao.

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.120
They say a general's forehead is broad enough for a horse to run on,

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.360
and a prime minister's belly can hold a boat.

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:03.840
That's right.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.080
I was just saying, Qingyan,

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.199
she absolutely refused to marry that Song Haoyang.

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.680
Turns out it's because she has someone like you,

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.159
such an outstanding son-in-law.

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:12.400
Qingyan,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.439
you should have told us earlier.

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:15.800
Qinghe,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.439
what are you standing there for?

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.560
Hurry up and get my

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:19.759
precious Biluochun tea.

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:21.040
Brew some for Mr. Gao.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.759
Yes, go quickly!

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.000
Why are we making tea?

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.120
Him?

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.439
He's just a fraud.

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:42.480
This guy isn't Gao Feng at all.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:44.920
He's just a food delivery guy.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.639
What?

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:48.040
A delivery guy?

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.120
That can't be.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.639
But, but...

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.240
We just saw it with our own eyes.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.399
He moved two billion in funds with a single phone call.

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:55.040
He even caused Apple Technology's stock to be suspended.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.879
Yeah.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:57.319
The Apple Technology incident

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.680
has absolutely nothing to do with him.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.920
Actually, rumors about Apple Technology's collapse

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:03.959
were already spreading yesterday.

00:05:04.399 --> 00:05:06.720
He probably overheard people talking

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.120
while delivering food.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.800
That's why he was pretending in front of you.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.839
But the way he looks with a mask on

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:14.560
really resembles the photos of Gao Feng in the news

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.439
It's really similar.

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:16.240
Yeah.

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:17.480
That's because he

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.040
deliberately dressed up to look like Gao Feng.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.680
His identity

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:23.879
I've already investigated thoroughly.

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:37.319
That's him.

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:39.160
That's him.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.839
The delivery guy.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:40.720
I knew it.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.000
Our Su family has no connection with Junsheng Group.

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:45.639
This Su Qingyan...

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:47.120
How could she possibly know

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.439
someone as important as Gao Feng?

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.240
So she found a delivery guy to trick us.

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:53.399
You delivery guy,

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.800
how dare you pretend to be Gao Feng and make fun of us?

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.199
If I don't teach you a lesson today,

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:01.199
you won't know how serious this is, will you?

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.480
Su Qingyan,

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.920
you've gone too far.

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:09.199
Not only have you repeatedly offended Young Master Song,

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.959
today you even found a food delivery guy

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.240
to pretend to be Gao Feng

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:14.879
and deceive us.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.600
Do you really think the Su family can't deal with you?

00:06:19.279 --> 00:06:20.079
Su Qingyan,

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:21.720
I know

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:23.040
you married this delivery guy

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.600
just to avoid the arranged marriage.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.800
But it doesn't matter.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.879
I don't mind.

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:31.439
As long as you obediently divorce this guy,

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:33.399
I'm still willing to marry you.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.959
Everything promised to your Su family

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:37.240
still stands.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.319
Oh wow,

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:39.199
listen to that.

00:06:39.319 --> 00:06:40.279
Even after all this,

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:42.079
Young Master Song still doesn't mind you.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.399
It seems Young Master Song

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:44.680
really loves you.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.600
Right now, immediately,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.319
divorce this delivery guy.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.920
Everything can still be fixed.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.000
It's not too late.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.720
That's right.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.839
Have you all said enough?

00:06:58.759 --> 00:06:59.120
Gao Feng.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.800
Su Zhengchun.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.399
You've lived so many years,

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.639
yet you have no insight at all.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.199
Do you know who I, Gao Feng, am?

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.920
Am I just some

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:08.319
what's his name—

00:07:08.839 --> 00:07:09.639
Song Haoyang—

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:11.680
someone he can figure out?

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:13.319
I'm standing in front of you

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:14.639
to give your Su family a chance.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.160
If you offend me,

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:17.319
can you bear the consequences?

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:21.639
Kid

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:23.000
Even now

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:23.839
You still dare to pretend

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:25.920
You say you're Gao Feng

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.240
Alright

00:07:27.439 --> 00:07:28.680
I'll give you a chance

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.360
Right now, Su Qingyan's company

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:33.160
needs sixty million in funding

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:34.439
to develop a new project

00:07:34.839 --> 00:07:36.079
Since you say you're him

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:38.720
then help her solve this money problem

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.000
If you can do it

00:07:40.279 --> 00:07:41.600
we'll believe

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:42.920
that you are Gao Feng

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:45.439
Young Master Song is right

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.959
Sixty million

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:49.480
is a huge sum for most people

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.399
but for Gao Feng

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:54.439
it's just pocket change

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.600
What about you?

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.000
Don't say we're bullying you.

00:07:59.399 --> 00:08:01.079
We'll give you two weeks.

00:08:02.399 --> 00:08:03.199
Is that enough?

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.959
It's just sixty million.

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.560
And you still need two weeks?

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:08.680
Two days is enough.

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:10.680
Two days?

00:08:11.839 --> 00:08:12.800
You're really pretending.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.439
Are you crazy?

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:14.759
Do you even know what you're saying?

00:08:14.879 --> 00:08:15.920
I do.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:16.759
You...

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.399
Fine.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.560
Two days it is.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.240
If after two days

00:08:22.319 --> 00:08:24.040
you still can't get the money together,

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:25.639
you'll divorce Qingyan.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.639
Qingyan will marry Young Master Song.

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:30.199
What if I manage to do it?

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.720
If you do,

00:08:31.959 --> 00:08:33.240
we'll acknowledge

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.799
your marriage.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.720
Young Master Song won't bother you anymore.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.039
It's a deal.

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:52.879
Honey,

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.919
why aren't you eating?

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.399
Are you upset?

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.559
You have the nerve to ask?

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.279
I've told you not to talk nonsense.

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:04.080
Why did you have to exaggerate so much?

00:09:04.559 --> 00:09:05.919
Sixty million, two weeks—

00:09:05.919 --> 00:09:07.600
maybe I could have found a way to handle it.

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:08.919
Why did you have to say two days?

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.159
I'm the dignified boss of Junsheng Group.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:13.759
Solving sixty million in two days

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.039
sounds reasonable.

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:17.919
Come on, you're just pretending.

00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:19.200
You're a fake.

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:21.159
Don't get too into the role, okay?

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:24.919
How about this—

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.600
You take responsibility for your own actions.

00:09:26.919 --> 00:09:27.919
Let me work at your company.

00:09:27.919 --> 00:09:28.840
I'll be your vice president.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.039
I'll help you solve the sixty million problem.

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:34.000
You're just a delivery guy.

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:35.840
How could you possibly solve sixty million for me?

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:39.080
Forget it.

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:40.080
Go eat.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.480
I'll figure out a solution myself.

00:09:47.039 --> 00:09:48.840
People need food to survive.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.200
If you skip a meal, you'll get really hungry.

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.720
If you get skinny from hunger,

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:53.120
you won't look as good as you do now.

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:55.039
Let's eat first.

00:09:55.039 --> 00:09:55.720
Oh no.

00:09:55.799 --> 00:09:56.879
Give it back to me.

00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.960
There are only two days left.

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:00.440
If we can't come up with a solution,

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.000
I'll have to marry Song Haoyang.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.679
Don't worry.

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:04.679
Since you've married me,

00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:06.639
I won't let you marry anyone else.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.679
I'll help you solve the sixty million issue.

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:09.480
Let's eat first.

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:10.600
Brother,

00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:11.879
sixty million

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.080
isn't six thousand yuan.

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:14.600
Alright, I'm begging you.

00:10:14.639 --> 00:10:15.440
Hurry up and give it back to me.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.600
Give it back to me.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:18.559
Give it back.

00:10:18.559 --> 00:10:19.519
Let's eat first.
